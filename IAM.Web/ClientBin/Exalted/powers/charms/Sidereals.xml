        <description>The target number of any dice roll using the chosen Ability decreases by one for every mote the player spends. For one mote, any roll of 6 or higher becomes a success; two motes grant success on rolls of 5 or higher. This Excellency cannot reduce a target number below 4.
   Alternatively, the player can spend one Willpower point and enough Essence to reduce the target number to 3. This grants an "auspicious success": the player forgoes the actual roll but transforms every die in the dice pool into an automatic success instead.
   If the player declares in Step 2 of attack resolution that he wants to purchase an auspicious success for a defensive Ability, the expenditure of one Willpower and enough Essence to lower the target number to 3 doubles his appropriate Defense Value against that attack.</description>

        <description>By tuning her Essence to resonate with one of the 25 constellations and its corresponding astrological college, a Sidereal can attune herself to a particular Ability and use its first three Excellencies with greater efficiency. Each two motes committed to this Charm reduce the mote cost for the first three Excellencies, to a minimum of zero. A character may never spend more than twice her permanent Essence on this Charm; and an Exalt may employ only one Propitious (Ability) Alignment at a time.
       Propitious (Ability) Alignment is incompatible with the Fateful Excellency: while employing this Charm, one cannot apply Essence Auspicious to any dice pool involving that Ability. If a character does so, the Propitious Alignment immediately ends. On the other hand, every dot a character has in an Ability's corresponding astrological college reduces the cost of Propitious (Ability) Alignment by one mote, to a minimum of 1. Thus, a Sidereal with Essence 3 and four levels of the Mask could spend two motes, and get the same results as if she spent six motes on Propitious Stealth Alignment.
   In every other way, Propitious (Ability) Alignment follows the same rules as Infinite (Ability) Mastery.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, a Sidereal can turn any item no longer than his arm and no heavier than his fist into a fully functional projectile. Be it a handful of sand, a flounder, a shout, or what-have-you, the Sidereal gives it the fate of an arrow - so the item functions as an arrow, of whatever type the character wants. The improvised projectile inflicts damage per a standard arrow of a chosen type, as well as inflicting any special effects based on the nature of the projectile. If, for instance, the archer uses a handful of sand and gives it the properties of a fowling arrow, his target not only suffers bashing damage from the attack but might also be temporarily blinded. The Charm also serves as a peculiar way to send a brief message: turn the words into an arrow and shoot them near the intended listener.</description>

The Sidereal's player rolls only a single attack, but each arrow applies its damage separately.

        <description>If skill cannot protect one of the Maidens' Chosen, then she may trust to the world's esteem for her office and duties. If not to that, then to Creation's fear of what she hopes to save it from. If not to that, to the world's dreams of glories faded that may yet return. And if all these fail, she may ask for luck and revenge. These are the Five Seasons Response. If an Archery-based attack strikes the Sidereal, she may invoke this Charm to reflect that attack back to its source. The attacker receives his own attack, using the same attack roll and including any Charms he used.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm using a prayer strip inscribed with the Scripture of the Clay Maiden. Infused with Essence, the strip rises into the air above the Sidereal's bow (holding steady at 10 yards) and glows a garish pink. The strip's influence triples the effective range for the character's Archery attacks.
   What's more, the character can perform the Generalized Ammunition Technique in reverse: he can transform arrows in flight into other materials or phenomena found in Creation... not all of them physical. The character learns one transformation when he first learns the Charm. He can learn as many other transformations as he pleases, either when he first learns the Charm or later, but each additional one costs one experience point (or two for one bonus point). During a scene in which this Charm is active, the Sidereal can use only one transformation per attack. Each arrow so transformed costs one mote. A character cannot transform projectiles he improvises with the Generalized Ammunition Technique or on arrows made of the magical materials. Some sample transformations include the following:
• Boulder: In mid-flight, the arrow transforms from a simple wooden shaft to a large boulder. The projectile becomes unblockable. It also doubles its raw damage against inanimate objects.
• Fire: The arrow dissolves in the air, to be replaced by a rain of fire. Everything within five yards of the target suffers one action's worth of environmental damage, as if from a bonfire (see Exalted, p. 131). Paper, dry grass, grease and other easily combustible substances catch fire.
• Glass: The projectile becomes an arrow of perfectly transparent glass. Unless the target's player succeeds on a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll at difficulty 2, the target loses sight of the projectile. As a result, his Defense Value become zero against that attack before adding bonuses from Charms or other supernatural effects.
• Grain: Where the arrow lands, a patch of ripe wheat grows, sufficient to feed one person for one day. The arrow must land in open ground for this effect to work. If the arrow hits a creature on open ground, the effect does not work unless that arrow also kills the creature.
• Health: Rather than suffering damage, the target of the attack is healed of one level of lethal or bashing damage for every dot the Sidereal has in Archery.
• Love: The arrow disintegrates in midair, and the attacker compares successes on his roll to the target's Dodge Mental Defense Value instead of Dodge Defense Value. If the attack "hits", the target falls madly in love with the first person the target sees. The effect is an Intimacy that the target cannot voluntarily erode for a number of days equal to the attacker's Essence. Ensuing events dictate whether the feelings linger or wither.
• Precipitation: For one minute after the arrow lands, rain or snow falls in the area (whichever is the least unlikely for the location and time of year). The affected area is 100 yards in diameter per dot of the Sidereal's Essence.</description>

   Once there was a Maiden...

            <errText>• Boulder: The base Damage of the attack becomes (Exalt's Essence) if it would be lower. Those who fail to defend suffer automatic Knockdown.
• Essence: The Sidereal draws her fingers through her anima and plucks a streamer of starfire to draw against her bowstring. She then fires this bolt into her target's anima, suffusing it with her own. For every one mote the Sidereal pays on this attack, she transfers two offensive motes to the target's Overdrive pool, if they have one. The Sidereal may pay up to three motes when firing Essence. In addition to offensive motes, the target character's anima twinkles and shimmers with tinges of the Sidereal's own until the end of the scene.
• Fire: The radius of effect is (Sidereal's Essence) yards. By paying 1wp in Step 1 of resolution, the Exalt may increase the hazard's Damage and Trauma to (Essence).
• Glass: There is no roll. The difficulty of tracking the arrow's flight subtracts an external penalty of (Exalt's Essence) from the target's DV, but the attack's minimum damage becomes 1 and it loses the Piercing tag, regardless of its usual properties.
• Grain: The Cost of using this option increases by 1m for every previous use in the same scene.
• Health: Ignore the given parameters of this effect. The Exalt rolls the minimum damage of the attack, healing levels of damage instead of inflicting harm. Soak does not hamper this power.
• Precipitation: The Exalt may pay a surcharge of 1wp to force snow or rain out-of-season.</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal folds a strand of his destiny over itself, shortening his overall lifespan by a few days in return for a brief boost of physical power. When the character does so, his player rolls (Essence + Athletics). For every success this roll garners, the player may add one dot to the character's Strength, Dexterity or Stamina for the rest of the scene. (Each point added thus costs three motes of Essence). These dice count against the maximum number of bonus dice a character can receive from Charms.</description>

When performing feats of strength, the Exalt doubles his Strength rating and converts bonus dice from stunts into extra successes (adding double their rating to relevant unrolled pools).

        <description>Ruby stardust falls from the sky and covers the Sidereal for a moment -and she takes off running. Her eyes focus straight ahead, and her feet keep her course within 10 degrees of her initial heading. While she moves, her soak increases by +5L/+5B, she suffers no fatigue penalties, she needs no sleep and she adds a number of dice equal to her Essence to any Athletics rolls required to make forward progress. (These benefits likewise apply to the character's mount if the character is riding).
   The character must continue to make forward progress, though, lest the Charm end suddenly. She can only run, sprint, jump, swim, ride, use a mobility-enhancing Charm or use the Lesser Sign of Mercury. If the reason for the character's journey changes - if she uses this Charm to flee, for instance, and her pursuers give up the chase -the player receives a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll to notice that circumstances have changed enough that she can end the Charm.</description>

        <description>A Sidereal must use Unswerving Juggernaut Principle before he can activate this Charm. In addition to all the benefits of the prerequisite Charm, the character cannot botch an Athletics roll devoted to making forward progress - any rolled botches are treated as regular failures. The character also adds his Essence to his Dodge Defense Value static value.
   A successful (Wits + Survival) roll enables the Seer to cover his tracks without slowing down or deviating from his course. If the roll succeeds, pursuers simply cannot tell that the character is proceeding in a straight line unless they succeed in the tracking contest. This Charm does not trump supernatural powers such as the Inevitable Pursuit Charm (see p. 175), since the attempt to cover one's tracks is not itself supernaturally enhanced.
   Forward-Thinking Technique also enables the character to climb or swim as fast as he can dash, as long as he keeps to his original heading. If the character uses this Charm during a scene that is being narrated tick-by-tick - such as a combat scene - he can swim or climb a number of yards per tick equal to (Dexterity + 6 - current wound penalties - armor mobility penalty). His doing so is considered a Move action, though, rather than a Dash action.</description>

• The Sidereal ignores penalties to his Dodge DV.
• The character can Dash reflexively, though this still makes it impossible to block attacks normally.
• The Exalt gains an additional +10L/10B soak against any unexpected attacks.
• The Seer adds (Athletics) extra successes to rolls to give or evade pursuit during chase scenes, as well as dramatic tracking/ evasion scenarios (see Exalted, p. 140).</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip of the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden. Infusing the strip with Essence, the Sidereal wraps the strip around her forehead or neck like a headband or scarf. For the rest of the day, the character acts under the effects of Inexorable Advance, and doubles her base Move and Dash distances. What's more, she has a pool of bonus successes equal to her Athletics that she can apply to any physical action. If the character engages in multiple actions, she divides the bonus successes among them. The player can reserve some successes for reflexive actions the character takes before her Defense Values refresh, but unused successes do not carry over from action to action.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who struck an iron wall
   Until it shattered her hand.
   She did not stop, though cracks spread throughout her bones.
   She did not stop, though blood sprayed her eyes.
   She did not stop until she shattered the wall.
   "Survival is fury", she said.</comment>

            <description>When the world cries out desperately to be saved by an agent of Heaven, it is not the harrowing tale of his journey that is most important—though tales will be told. What matters most in saving the world is that the Sidereal be where he is needed. Activating this Charm, the Sidereal wraps a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden around his neck like a scarf, causing it to exude a scent of lilacs and decay. As long as it does so, he does not so much move from place to place as simply arrive at each point on his journey without crossing the intervening space. The Exalt ignores the difficulties of terrain, including water, muck and unstable terrain, and any hazards between his starting and stopping points each tick he moves.
   Perhaps more impressive, the Sidereal may take a moment to plot his course more carefully, determining his ultimate goal and ignoring the obstacles in between. This requires a Miscellaneous action and expenditure of 1wp, which allows the Exalt to teleport up to (Essence x 10) yards to a point that he can see clearly. He has given up the accidental self-determination of those with more uncertain journeys, and so cannot perform any normal movement actions (Dash, Move, etc.) until his next action tick.
   The first effect of this Charm contests wards against teleportation with a normal roll-off, while the latter fails automatically.</description>

        <description>The character keeps one eye on the present while the other eye watches for impending trouble. At any time during the next five hours when the character is just about to get into trouble, the player may make a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll. If this roll succeeds, the character feels a frisson of cold or gets a sinking sensation in his guts that warns him of a danger on the horizon. This sensation befalls him two minutes per success in advance of the danger and assumes that he will not change his course of action in the intervening period.
   Example: Black Ice Shadow uses this Charm while walk-ing through the jungle. The Storyteller tells the Sidereal's player to make the reflexive roll, and the roll garners five successes. The Storyteller informs the player that danger lies 10 minutes ahead. If Black Ice Shadow had continued on his present course at his present speed, he would have walked right into the danger unknowing. Since the character has been warned, however, he can change his intended actions to mitigate or avoid it. Barring that, he can at least approach the danger ready and vigilant - possibly with a prayer strip ready in hand.
   This Charm doesn't provide a specific warning of what danger lies ahead, only that something will happen. The aforementioned Sidereal might not know if an ambush lurks ahead, a nest of claw striders or a booby-trapped bridge across a deep chasm. When or if the danger confronts him, though, he'll recognize it as the foreseen peril.</description>

            <description>Casting her perception into the near future, the Sidereal senses the presence of imminent danger. The Storyteller should have the Sidereal's player roll any Awareness rolls that she is allowed to notice a threat (Essence x 2) minutes before she would normally be able to roll. When the Storyteller cannot determine the difficulty of the roll beforehand, use the highest ([Intelligence + Larceny] / 2) of any character involved in the threat - or difficulty 1 if the Sidereal could notice the threat automatically. On a success, she receives a vague premonition of harm, putting her on guard without actually revealing the nature of the threat. Such forewarning adds one automatic success to her actual roll to notice the threat when it finally arrives.</description>

        <description>This Charm provides a more specific and more immediate warning about some impending trouble. The Charm activates automatically when an immediate, unexpected danger or unfortunate occurrence is just about to happen. When the bandits hiding on the ridgeline are about to open fire with their crossbows, the Sidereal realizes an ambush is imminent. If the Sidereal's most cherished acquaintance (per the Background of that name) lifts to her lips a teacup that has been painted with an immediately fatal poison, the Sidereal realizes he's about to lose her to poison. If an erstwhile Dragon-Blooded confidant leaves the room to signal his Abyssal allies, the Sidereal realizes that the Dynast is about to betray the character.
   As a result, the Sidereal is never caught unaware by an unexpected attack. His warning of danger comes one miscellaneous action ahead of the imminent trouble. The Charm works as long as the character has Essence to spend.</description>

            <description>Vague premonitions of future sorrow drift through the mind of a Sidereal who has mastered this Charm. As her fated suffering impends, these visions crystallize into awareness. Expected Pain cancels the unexpected quality of any physical or social attack against the Sidereal. It costs an additional two motes when used to defend against creatures outside of fate.
   With Awareness 5+, this Charm can be activated to enhance any Awareness roll to notice a concealed threat to the Sidereal or her allies - a hidden assailant, a drop of poisonous lotus extract dissolved in a cup of tea, a venereal disease on a concubine. Doing so converts all dice on the roll to automatic successes.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the character expands her awareness not into the future, but across a broader swatch of the present. The character must look for something specific, be it a person, a spirit, the use of her name, the use of Essence, the outbreak of combat or some other objectively definable phenomenon. If that specific thing appears or occurs within (character's Essence x 100) yards, the Sidereal becomes aware of it. She doesn't receive a clairvoyant vision, per se, so much as she receives a general understanding. She might know the location of a person she monitors but wouldn't necessarily know what that person is doing. If the character watches for a phenomenon, though, she does get a general sense of its power level. If she watches for combat, for example, she can tell the difference between two gangs clashing over disputed turf and two rival noblemen dueling over a girl. If the character looks for the use of Essence, she could tell the difference between a fellow Sidereal's reflexive use of the Forgotten Earth Charm (see p. 153) and a sorcerer casting the Incomparable Body Arsenal spell (see Exalted, p. 255). In these circumstances, the character can even recognize specific Charms, spells or other supernatural powers, if she's seen their use before.
   Supernal Awareness does not detect creatures outside of fate. Creatures governed by fate, however, cannot conceal themselves from this Charm by any natural or supernatural means. The more times a Sidereal activates this Charm in a scene, the more creatures or phenomena she can watch for at a time.</description>

        <description>When the Sidereal faces a choice between options, she can peek into the future to see which choice would bring her the best outcome in the next month. The Charm does not, however, show the consequences of her decision beyond that point. The Charm might show her, for example, which of a range of investment opportunities will yield the greatest short-term dividends but wouldn't reveal that investing her money in that particular venture secretly puts cash in the pocket of the merchant prince whose business practices will destabilize the satrapy's economy.
   Wise Choice does not reveal options the Sidereal herself does not consider. For instance, if a Sidereal uses Wise Choice to choose between two paths in a labyrinth, the Charm won't reveal the secret door that provides a third option. The character must also define what sort of outcome she considers optimal: maximum profit, the shortest path or whatever. The Charm always provides a rough estimate of personal danger, though.
   Groups of Sidereals can look further into the future. A circle of five Seers, each of a different caste, can use Wise Choice to assess consequences up to a year in the future. Five such circles can consider outcomes 100 years in the future. The entire Five-Score Fellowship can look an Age in the future. The further they look, however, the wider becomes the spread of possibilities, unless truly grand, Creation-wide forces are at work - as they were when the Sidereals pondered what to do about the madness of the Lawgivers. All participants must know Wise Choice to gain the group benefits.</description>

        <description>A Sidereal with this Charm can follow his prey through the scrubbed-crystal streets of Chiaroscuro, across the wind-blown tundra of the North or even across the endless oceans themselves. The Sidereal notes his prey's path not by physical traces but by evidence the character leaves on the Tapestry itself. As the quarry's fate weaves its way across Creation, the fate affects all other fates with which the quarry's fate interacts. The Sidereal can even follow creatures outside fate by using this Charm to follow the disturbances in the Tapestry such creatures leave behind them.
   If the area is largely uninhabited, the Sidereal can follow a trail of this kind that is no older than (character's Essence) days. If the Sidereal tracks his prey thus through a more populous region, such as a city or a heavily traveled road, the chaos of interweaving destinies becomes harder to read. He can follow trails no older than (character's Essence) hours.
   In instances when this Charm conflicts with Charms that make a creature harder to track, use the normal Charm versus Charm rules (see Exalted, p. 179), using (Essence + Awareness) for the Sidereal's side of the contest.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Scythe. She holds the strip up before a living target and infuses the strip with Essence. The strip sticks to the air, and violet flowers bloom all over the prayer strip. These flowers sprout, blossom, wilt and die, raining dry petals at the target's feet. This is all that bystanders see. The target, however, experiences the soul-upheaving horror of his own death - or at least the way he is most likely to die. Six seconds later, the target finds himself back where the Sidereal used the Charm, the ground covered in dead purple petals.
   If the target is a Storyteller character, the Storyteller rolls the character's Willpower against a difficulty of 3 as the vision plays out. If the roll succeeds, the character is taken aback and Inactive for the next six ticks, but nothing more happens. If the roll fails, the character's Willpower drops to a single point, his personal Essence drops to zero and his peripheral Essence drops by an amount equal to his maximum personal Essence (to a minimum of zero). He cannot recover Willpower or Essence for the rest of the scene.
   If the target is a player's character, the Storyteller can let the aforementioned rules suffice or literally play the ending scene out for a more dramatic effect. In playing out the scene, the targeted character's player still rolls Willpower at difficulty 3. The Storyteller then sets up a plausible death scene for the target character. The character has his full Essence pools, Willpower pool, health levels, dice pools and Charms (regardless of his actual present condition), and he participates in the scene just as if it actually happened.
   If target character somehow survives his doom, he comes out of the experience no worse for the wear (and it doesn't matter whether the player succeeded on the initial Willpower roll). Within a few scenes after the vision, all of his spent Willpower points recharge. If the target of the Charm dies in the vision but his player succeeded on the initial Willpower roll, the character emerges from the vision shaken or awash in fatalistic calm, but suffers no ill effects. If the target of the Charm dies in the vision and the player failed the initial Willpower roll, the character suffers the effects noted for Storyteller characters. If the Willpower roll botched, the character loses one dot of that trait.
   This Charm does not affect either Abyssal Exalted or the dead. The prayer strip simply disintegrates into worthless violet petals. It does, however, affect Second and Third Circle demons as normal, despite the Fate keyword... for the Primordial War taught them they can die, without any hope of reincarnation.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Maiden and the Scythe
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who was born, and told her mom, "I know how I'm gonna die.
   "It's gonna hurt bad,
   And I ain't coming back.
   "...I could avoid it, but I won't.
   "'cause one day, death'd come to me and say, 'Baby, don't you know?'
   "'There's always an ending.'"</comment>

   There is no Willpower roll to resist this Charm. Instead, the Sidereal rolls (Perception + Awareness + Essence) as an unblockable social attack against the target of the Charm. While such a vision is an unnatural Illusion, it cannot be resisted with Willpower. Characters are not rendered Inactive by this Charm; instead, they are forced to take a Guard action on their next action tick as the vision overwhelms their capacity to act.
   Should the events prophesied in a player character’s vision of death come to pass, the knowledge of their fated death hangs over their head. They suffer a -3 internal penalty on any action to fight against their foretold doom, unless they pay two Willpower to resist this unnatural Emotion for one scene. Should a character succeed in fighting against destiny and survive they events prophesied to bring about their end, they recover all points of temporary Willpower, finding new hope in their second chance at life. Exalted characters also lose a point of Limit.</errText>

        <description>Not only do inefficiency and corruption undermine a bureaucracy's authority, they inject chaos and decay into a society for the benefit of an amoral few. These failings are bad enough in mortal bureaucracies, but when the bureaucracies of Yu-Shan grow lazy or corrupt, all of Creation can suffer.
   This Charm, then, helps a Sidereal ensure the proper behavior of a social unit's member for the benefit of everyone who relies on the organization. (This does not need to be a literal bureaucracy: any social group that has definable leaders, followers and procedures, no matter how informal, falls under the Charm's purview). The Sidereal activates the Charm as he touches a bureaucrat - which might require a Martial Arts roll if the target is unwilling. As a bright spark flashes from deep within the Sidereal's eyes, his player rolls (Charisma + Bureaucracy) against the target's Dodge Mental Defense Value. If the roll succeeds, the victim is compelled to perform his duties honestly and to the best of his abilities for five days.</description>

        <description>The Maidens gave their Chosen a frightening authority over spirits. When a Sidereal activates Terminal Sanction against a present god or elemental, the player rolls (Charisma + Bureaucracy) against a difficulty of the targeted spirit's Essence. Whether this roll succeeds or fails, the spirit must materialize before the Sidereal and remain solid until the end of the scene. If the roll does succeed, the spirit has even more reason to fear the Sidereal. Should the spirit "die" in that scene, the Sidereal has four choices:
• The Sidereal can destroy the spirit.
• He could bind the spirit to his service - either one task of indefinite duration or general obedience for one year and one day.
• He can bind the spirit's Essence into an object, creating an artifact rated at half the spirit's Essence (round up). The Storyteller designs the artifact, based on the powers of the spirit. The artifact lasts only a year and a day, however, before the spirit goes free.
• If nothing else, the Sidereal can simply let the spirit reform in its sanctum, knowing full well what the Sidereal could have done to it.
   Thanks to the terms of the Yozis' surrender, this Charm also works against demons of every Circle and adds a number of automatic successes on the (Charisma + Bureaucracy) roll against them equal to the Sidereal's Essence. This gives Sidereals a second chance to control demons that escape control.</description>

This gives Sidereals a second chance to control demons that escape control.
   With a Bureaucracy 5+, Essence 4+ repurchase, a Sidereal may use this Charm to target multiple spirits at once. By adding +4m to its Cost, the Exalt may compel up to 10 spirits of a certain kind to materialize, and if the roll is successful doom them in the event of their defeat. "Kinds" of spirits are delineated by the usual types (elemental, god, demon), as well as whether or not they are officially employed by Heaven. An Exalt could compel all Celestial censor elemental dragons to appear, or all unaffiliated elemental dragons, but not both at once. A third purchase at Bureaucracy and Essence 6+ allows the Sidereal to add another +4m to sanction up to (Essence / 2) Magnitude spirits at once.</description>
            <errText>This Charm has a range of (Essence x 10) yards. Activation of this Charm inflicts an unblockable and undodgeable unnatural Compulsion to materialize. The target is made aware of the Exalt's presence and distance when affected by this Charm. Binding spirits with it is an irresistible unnatural Servitude. When used to bind demons, it is identical to sorcerous binding, preventing other bindings of the same demon.</errText>

        <description>The more important someone is, the more people he has scurrying to do his will. The more such people he has under him, the less distinct they all become, until he barely notices any individual one of them. By internalizing the underlying concept, a Sidereal can wrap himself in that same anonymity and invisibility... but only against people who consider themselves better than the Sidereal - or at least better than the type of person the Sidereal pretends to be. A person might consider himself personally better than the Sidereal, of higher social class, higher in an organization, or just generally better than everyone.
   When a Sidereal encounters such a person while using this Charm, that person cannot notice the Sidereal. The person might notice signs of the Sidereal's passing, such as footprints, but not while the Sidereal is present. It doesn't help if other people, who can see the Sidereal, point her out; the arrogant victim just doesn't pay attention. At most, the Sidereal leaves a faint impression based on her caste. Chosen of Journeys give the victim a sense that he needs to be someplace else. Chosen of Serenity make the victim feel happy or peaceful. Chosen of Battles make the victim tense and wary. Chosen of Secrets give the victim a sense of déjà vu. Chosen of Endings leave a vague sense of anxiety and futility.
   Effects that grant a perfect counter to invisibility pierce this effect. This Charm's glaring flaw - although Sidereals don't consider it such - is that it does not affect other Sidereals. A Vizier in the guise of a Guild merchant could follow the barbarian Bull of the North unnoticed from hell to breakfast, but any effort to sneak past his Sidereal field supervisor in Yu-Shan to drop off a late report would be doomed to failure.</description>

        <description>A Vizier can declare an ending to a bureaucracy's usefulness. The Charm attacks a social unit consisting of the members of an established bureaucracy. The Sidereal's player rolls (Wits + Bureaucracy) and adds the character's Essence in automatic successes; the difficulty equals the Dodge Mental Defense Value of the unit's leader, plus half the unit's Magnitude. If the roll succeeds, the Sidereal can impose one of two effects:
• The Pervasive Ennui Sabotage gives everyone in the bureaucracy a fatalistic sense of the ultimate worthlessness of their work. This overwhelming feeling of futility grinds the wheels of the bureaucratic machine to a halt.
• The Frenetic Activity Infusion fills everyone in the affected bureaucracy with the importance of their work. Everyone becomes very busy... circulating memos about modalities for planning sessions about mission statements for quality control of department reorganization. In the rush, nobody notices that the bureaucracy's ostensible purpose remains undone.
   Either way, the bureaucracy remains paralyzed for as the Sidereal maintains the Essence commitment, or until the bureaucracy's leader expends three Loyalty to get everyone working again.
   Use of this Charm against an office of the Celestial Bureaucracy would be a Severity 3 offense, assuming anyone noticed.</description>

            <errText>This Charm is a social attack against a bureaucratic social group. It is conventionally opposed by the target's MDV, with an additional external penalty equal to half the group's Magnitude (round up).
   Undoing what the Sidereal has done is possible with normal bureaucratic and social maneuvering. Working to fix the group is an extended (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) dramatic action, with a per-roll difficulty equal to the Exalt's Essence and a cumulative difficulty equal to (10 x extra successes on this Charm’s activation roll, minimum 10).</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm using a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden's Promise. When she infuses the strip with Essence and casts the strip on the ground, the strip explodes in a flash of amethyst light. While the Sidereal himself is immune to the effect, all the people present feels an unnatural mental influence to cease their arguing over whatever they disagree about. A customer would stop haggling with the vendor and just split the difference between the listed price and what he wanted to pay before, which the vendor would gladly accept just to make a sale. Two rowdy street gangs would decide to just let this turf squabble go this time and move off in separate directions. The senators of the Lesser House of the Deliberative would cease their semi-civilized bickering and just put the contentious issue to a vote.
   Characters with a higher Essence than the Sidereal are immune to the effect, but they cannot force affected characters to continue arguing. Individuals can resist the Charm by spending three Willpower. The Sidereal can use this Charm to affect a group of characters whose Magnitude does not exceed his Essence.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Maiden and the Dust
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who learned that the faster she ran, the faster she could run.
   Thus, running consumed her,
   Until one day, she flew beyond the ending of her life.
   "And here I thought it'd last forever", she said. "But -"
   "There's always an ending", said the run.</comment>

   A Sidereal may instead strip conflict of interest and graft from a bureaucrat, rolling Strength instead of Charisma against a single target. If successful, the target suffers the effects of Icy Hand indefinitely and with no mote commitment from the Exalt. The only way to escape his Compulsion to duty is for the target to resign from his position, though he may take up another job in which to laze and extort.</description>
            <errText>The described use of this Charm is a social attack against those present, the Sidereal rolling (Charisma + Bureaucracy) and adding (Essence) automatic successes versus Dodge MDV.

        <description>The Sidereal gains a special understanding of the element associated with a particular Maiden. This understanding permits him to channel Willpower through his Compassion to aid in dice rolls pertaining to social dealings with appropriate elementals and gods, regardless of the circumstances. This bonus also applies to the Sidereal's social dealings with Dragon-Blooded of the appropriate element. (See the descriptions of each Sidereal caste in Chapter Four for the Maidens' elemental associations).
   A Sidereal has no trouble gaining this Charm for his Maiden's favored element, as long as he has the form of Craft associated with that element. Gaining an understanding of other elements requires special permission from that element's Maiden or her deputy in the Bureau of Destiny. Heaven does not pay special attention to the use of this Charm, though. A Seer can gain an affinity for as many elements as he likes, but every such understanding requires a separate purchase of this Charm, and at least two dots in the proper elemental Craft.</description>

   Exalts do not need to relearn this Charm to apply its effects to elements other than their Caste association. Instead, they must simply achieve a rating of 4+ in the associated Craft.</errText>

        <description>Superb works of magical or mundane craftsmanship can become tools of destiny in the right hands. With this Charm, the Sidereal craftsman makes it apparent that destiny simply cannot wait for the object he's putting together. As a result, circumstances conspire so the Sidereal finishes his work in a fraction of the time such artifice would normally take. Divide the amount of time a Craft project would normally take by an amount equal to the character's Essence.</description>

        <description>By handling an object for an hour, a Seer can bind its destiny to his own. Thereafter, the character may reflexively spend two motes of Essence to learn the object's general circumstances - where it is, what sort of person has it, what that person is doing with it. The Sidereal can instead spend the two motes to engender a series of events that brings the object back to her. Perhaps a thief steals it and passes it off to a fence in the Sidereal's employ. Perhaps the acquaintance (per the Background) who left with the object chooses that moment to visit the Sidereal and brings it with him. If the circumstances aren't ideal for the Sidereal to draw the object to him, the object might not make it all the way to his hands, but it makes some progress each time. He may continue to monitor the object's location until the object returns to him.
   If the Sidereal loses in combat an object affected by this Charm, he can spend the motes (and use a stunt) to call it back to his hand. Doing so must involve the scenery or circumstances: he can't simply make the object float back to him. But if an enemy knocks the Sidereal's daiklave from his grasp, for instance, an arrow meant for the Sidereal's heart might knock the tumbling blade back into his hand.
   A character can bind to herself a maximum number of objects equal to her Craft (Fate) score.</description>

            <errText>Ignore the required hour of handling. Instead, this Charm can target any object the character owns (Exalted, p. 238), as long as no other Essence user owns it. This Charm is a Shaping effect that dictates circumstances and actions; extras cannot resist this script for the world, while others may spend 1wp to pass off their duty to fulfill destiny to someone else.
   A Sidereal may use this Charm to observe and affect any number of objects he owns. He maintains ownership by using Destiny-Knitting Entanglement to check in at least once every day. Failure to do so allows others to claim it in full, preventing use of this Charm. Other effects that assert absolute ownership of the object will also thwart this Charm.
   Recalling an object in combat costs nothing and is reflexive.</errText>

        <description>The character develops an enviable knack for ma-nipulating fate in a particular circumstance, environment or condition personal to her. This condition could be "In Cities", "On the Water" or defined by other similar parameters. It should have the same breadth as a specialty. When that specialty condition applies, the target number for Craft (Fate) rolls and all rolls for Sidereal astrology automatically decrease by one. The Sidereal doesn't pay for this reduction; it exists as a permanent enhancement of her capabilities.
   A character can buy this Charm up to three times, either for the same condition or a selection of two or three conditions.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal's long experience in crafting destinies and fatescenarios begets an enviable knack for manipulating circumstances in her own personal style. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Sidereal chooses a circumstantial condition roughly equivalent in breadth to a specialty, such as "Seduction", "Swords", or "At Sea". Whenever she is awarded stunt dice while the chosen condition is met, she may exchange dice to lower the target number of her roll on a one-for-one basis.
   At the Storyteller's discretion, the Sidereal may change the condition for her World-Shaping Artistic Vision whenever she faces major changes in her life, selecting a new condition that makes sense for the upheaval in her life. Changing Motivation is always sufficient ground for choosing a new condition for this Charm.</description>

        <description>This Charm reverses its prerequisite, so an object goes from the Sidereal to someone or someplace else. The Seer must herself craft the object, from a sword to a calligraphic scroll. While doing so, she knots the object's destiny to the fate of a chosen person or location. The character must know this person or place by name, and have something physically connected to the target: a swatch of a person's clothing, a few hairs, a bit of soil or a creature from a target location or the like.
   The destiny-guided object moves toward its goal for as long as the Sidereal keeps Essence committed to the Charm. This may take less than a day for a person in the same town, or many months to cross Creation. Initially and each month thereafter, the Sidereal's player rolls (Wits + Craft [Fate]) to see how quickly or how far the object moves toward its destination; the Storyteller sets the difficulty for this extended roll, based on the target's proximity (from 1 for a person in town to 20 or more to cross Creation). Destinations in the Wyld or Underworld multiply the difficulty as normal (see p. 208). Excellencies may supplement the first roll but not the subsequent increments: they are no longer actions the character takes, but merely measure the progress of something that continues beyond the character's direct control. A botch on any of these rolls indicates the object was destroyed or otherwise cannot proceed any further. The character knows when this happens or when the object finally reaches its destination.
   The object sent by this Charm may simply be useful in its own right - or dangerous, such as a forged map designed to lure the target into a trap. The object can also carry a Sidereal astrology effect as part of the object's fate-crafting, as a way to deliver ascending or descending destinies to people or places the Sidereal cannot reach directly.</description>

   At Craft and Essence 5+ a Sidereal may use this Charm to banish things from a realm of existence, instead of simply sending it to somewhere else. Doing so is a normal invocation of the Charm, with a cumulative difficulty appropriate to sending the object to a destination in another realm of existence. Once it passes beyond the bounds of the originating realm, however, it becomes lost to that world.
   The destiny tangled about it will not permit it to return. As long as the motes remain committed to this Charm, the object travels freely outside the realm from which it was banned. Any attempt to return it there meets widespread cosmic resistance. For every dot of Essence the Sidereal possesses, either a botch will occur on an action necessary to return the item, similar to a broken Eclipse oath, or some new circumstance will arise to prevent or redirect its return. Once these preventive threads of destiny have been worn away, the Charm ends and the item may return freely.
   The instant before he dies, a Vizier may empower his banishments to persist past his ending. At that time, he chooses which banishments he currently maintains that will continue and which to release normally. Thereafter, the effect cannot be undone without ablating the protective destinies that keep the object away.</description>
            <errText>The Sidereal may set any object on its way with this Charm, not only those she creates, needing only the name of the place or person. She cannot target attuned artifacts, and this can be dealt with as a Shaping effect when targeting other objects. Each week, the Sidereal rolls (Wits + [Craft necessary to create the object]), adding (Craft [Fate]) bonus dice. The Exalt may apply Excellencies normally to each roll.
   The Storyteller sets a cumulative difficulty based on both distance and probability, which may range as high as 50. It tends to be harder for things to get from Chanta to Luthe, but if the Exalt starts the object's journey by dropping it into the back of a Guild caravan it should require fewer successes than leaving it on the side of the road. The cumulative difficulty for an object journeying within the same realm of existence should rarely exceed 20, and for traveling between realms of existence it should rarely be less than 30. Do not multiply the necessary successes based on cross-realm travel.
   The difficulty for each roll is the same as the per-roll difficulty to Craft the object, as it is more likely for treasures and wonders to be caught up in new destinies. The Charm ends prematurely only if the Exalt rolls more than (Essence) botches in a row.</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal can mend damaged sections of fate in an area. Doing so requires a roll of (Dexterity + Craft [Fate]). Each success heals a single health level that the target lost to a creature or effect of the Demon Realm, the Underworld or the Wyld; each success also repairs damage inflicted by sorcery. Successes could, instead, heal debilitating effects wrought by such creatures - at a cost of one success per mote of Essence spent to inflict the harm. If, for instance, a sorcerer cast Rain of Doom (see Exalted, p. 256), using this Charm to repair the damage would take 60 successes. The Charm is also effective against changes imposed by the unstable Wyld. Five successes on the Craft (Fate) roll cleanse a Wyld pox or deficiency, 10 successes remove an affliction or debility, 20 heal a blight or deformity and 30 cure an abomination. Fifty successes could wipe out the Wyld influence in a square mile of the Bordermarches or tainted land, but the Charm cannot affect territory deeper in the Wyld.
   Since this is a Simple Charm, with an instant duration, the only way to build up such large numbers of successes is to have large numbers of Sidereals performing the Charm simultaneously in an area.</description>

   Since this is a Simple Charm, with an instant duration, the only way to build up such large numbers of successes is to have large numbers of Sidereals performing the Charm simultaneously in an area.
   With Essence 4+ a Sidereal may exert fine enough control over the warp and weft of fate that he may aid the pattern spiders more closely. When the damage a thing or character has suffered is a directly contradictory result to a Sidereal astrology destiny laid upon the victim or the vandal, the Exalt may undo the harm with Mending Warped Designs. Note that a destiny to "parry blows" is not contradictory to having suffered harm, but "showing up at the dinner party unharmed" is.</description>
            <errText>The dice pool for repairing a target is based on the appropriate Ability, with (Sidereal's Essence) bonus dice. Healing living beings requires Medicine, and inanimate objects or structures call for the appropriate Craft. It can undo the direct results of actions performed by anything outside fate, as well as sorcery and necromancy spells. The difficulty of undoing non-health level effects of spells is equal to (Circle x 10). The difficulty of undoing a mutation is equal to twice the mutation's point value. Undoing similar changes to inanimate things faces a similar difficulty according to Storyteller adjudication.
   Cleansing a contiguous area of tainted land within (Essence) miles requires (Resources value of the land x 10) successes. This Charm cannot actually turn Bordermarches into true Creation, but it can enforce the normal laws of Creation on a waypoint for the rest of the story with 30 successes.</errText>

        <description>This Charm harnesses fate itself to construct an object at a Sidereal's command. She must procure all the necessary materials and provide a workspace. Then she writes the Scripture of Lover and Maiden on a prayer strip, binds it around her wrists and infuses it with Essence. The prayer strip transforms into a twisting band of blue light around her wrists. (Having this band in place imposes a -2 external penalty to actions that require the use of the character's hands).
   Fortunately, actual construction of the object the Sidereal designed doesn't require the use of her hands. The raw materials mold themselves and flow together on their own, assembling themselves as the Sidereal intends. The Craft project still requires its normal dice pools and Ability minimums - but, supplemented by this Charm, each die becomes one automatic success and construction of mundane objects takes 10 minutes per roll. Objects involving the magical materials (except moonsilver, which cannot be part of the construction) require a full hour per roll. Architectural or geomantic projects, such as the construction of a manse, take a week for every year they would normally require. The work proceeds as long as the character keeps the Essence committed and pays attention to the labor.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of Lover and Maiden
   Once there was a maiden...
   ...who met a thing that lived outside the world, and there was a beauty to it.
   It burned with an unholy wrath that could destroy Creation.
   It hated her as much as it loved her.
   Its kiss was blood and perfection, for its teeth were sharp.
   It offered her power, and with it, hooks to tear her soul.
   With care not to burn her fingers, she took it into her life.
   "Love is what you make of it", said she.</comment>

            <errText>Rather than enhancing a project the Sidereal undertakes, this Charm allows it to continue in the absence of the Exalt. It does not change the time needed for the project to complete itself, producing the same amount of work effort as if the Sidereal were personally constructing the item. Intervals and rolls may be enhanced normally with other Charms the Exalt knows, but these must be determined when Implicit Construction Methodology is activated and their mote costs are committed as long as this Charm lasts. Willpower and other costs are paid at normal intervals. Instead of converting all dice into successes, this Charm reduces the target number of the dice pool by 1, to a minimum of 4.
   Because the project is not carried out in a remotely normal manner, teamwork and assistants cannot aid the project unless the Storyteller deems they are appropriately strange enough to insinuate themselves into the process.
   The Sidereal intuits when the project is completed.</errText>

   Even destiny falls into regular patterns, and to avoid one blow is just as good as avoiding all a foe's attacks. Sidereals with Dodge 4+, Essence 3+ may repurchase this Charm. If it enhanced a successful application of the character's Dodge DV against an attacker previously in the same tick, subsequent uses against that same attacker also raise the target number of the their dice pool by 1.</description>

        <description>Vibrations in the strands of fate alert a Sidereal to imminent danger. Her player rolls (Dexterity + Dodge) against a difficulty equal to the permanent Essence of the foe responsible for the trouble. (Environmental dangers are difficulty 1). If the roll succeeds, the Exalt avoids the harmful effect. For this Charm's purposes, a "harmful effect" includes unexpected attacks, area-of-effect attacks, attacks with no physical component or even continuous effects with a duration longer than instant. (The character only needs to avoid a continuous effect once). Attacks with very wide areas of effect (such as the Rain of Doom spell) defeat this Charm if the character is physically incapable of moving the distance needed to escape the effect.
   The Sidereal's player must activate this Charm either before her opponent's attack roll or as soon as the player becomes aware of the effect.</description>

        <description>The character wasn't actually there when the trouble began. That's his story, and the Loom of Fate backs it up.
   If - within his first two actions after Join Battle or Join Debate - the Sidereal decides he would rather have been somewhere else, he can activate this Charm. Having done so, he vanishes from his current location and reappears in another location. The Sidereal cannot control his new location, but it's someplace plausible for him to be if he'd decided to take a different course a few minutes before. Simultaneously, an Illusion effect blurs the memories of other people so they don't remember the Sidereal's presence. Wounds still bleed, traps remain sprung, Essence remains spent. However, other people in the aborted encounter receive vague notions of an alternate series of events to explain any evidence of the Sidereal's presence, which they soon confabulate into a detailed scenario that they believe completely. Spending two Willpower overcomes this Illusion.</description>

        <description>By joining the fates of other people to her own, a Sidereal not only can escape danger herself but protect people around her as well. In a scene in which this Charm is active, the Sidereal can use any Dodge Charm she knows on behalf of a number of targets whose combined Essence scores do not exceed her own (provided a given target reflexively consents to this protection). Simple Charms use the Sidereal's Dodge Defense Value on the character's action. Reflexive Charms use the Sidereal's Dodge Defense Value as well. Supplemental Charms enhance the protected target's action.
   Using a Dodge Charm on a willing target's behalf counts as the Sidereal's using that Charm for that action, and the Exalt must pay any costs associated with that Charm. The character can use a Dodge Charm that is part of a Combo on a protected target, and still use the other Charm(s) in the Combo on herself.</description>

            <description>Generous Sidereals learn to spot impending danger to others, protecting the people around them even as they escape danger themselves. While this Charm is active, the Sidereal may take a Dodge-based Defend Other action (page 9), substituting her Dodge DV for her Parry DV. She treats these as Speed 3, DV -0 miscellaneous actions, and can always channel Compassion to protect a warded character.
   In addition, if the Sidereal activates Avoidance Kata while protecting another character with a Dodge-based Defend Other action, she may bring that character along with her if they are willing, paying an additional point of Willpower for each other character who vanishes with her.
   A Dodge 4+ repurchase of this Charm allows the Sidereal to commit up to (Dexterity – 1) additional motes when activating this Charm. While it is active, she may flurry to take multiple Dodge-based Defend Other actions on a single action tick, with each additional committed mote adding one to the number of Defend Other actions she can maintain simultaneously.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal infuses Essence into a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the Hunted Maiden and wraps the strip around his waist like a belt. The prayer strip transforms into a band of cerulean light and cinches tight, inflicting two levels of unsoakable bashing damage. Every hour after that, the belt cinches tighter, inflicting two more levels of damage. This damage will not heal until the Charm ends.
   With the belt in place, the character starts to walk or run. Charms or the Lesser Sign of Mercury may enhance these movement actions. He drags with him a portion of Creation with a maximum radius (in miles) equal to his Essence, with the Exalt in the center. The terrain, habitations and people within that area all relocate to the place where the Exalt stops walking or running. The territory's original location fills in with scenery appropriate to the geographical context, perhaps including nearby homes. Clerks in Yu-Shan monitor the transfer and make sure that the fate of every relocated person or thing is accounted for in its new  ARMS position. All witnesses to or subjects of the effect remember the region's old geography but thereafter consider the new arrangement to be perfectly correct and reasonable. (Most minds can't comprehend such a grand reorganization of the Tapestry of Creation... so they ignore it).
   A Sidereal cannot use this Charm to move only parts of large discrete terrain features - such as half a mountain, a segment of a river or just the market district of a city. If the radius of effect isn't large enough to encompass the entire definable feature, that part of the landscape stays in place as the rest of the region moves. The moving region does not interact with physical Creation while the Sidereal moves, but he cannot drag a moving region onto an inhabited area. (The paperwork alone... You've never heard such complaining). Nor can the Sidereal drag one region onto another in order to "erase" something in the affected region. The Sidereal cannot, for instance, drag a lake across a forest and relocate the lake on top of a forgotten Solar's tomb in order to make that tomb disappear. The tomb would, instead, recede with the displaced forest to the lake's edge or rise from the center of the lake on a creepy, mist-shrouded island.
   Using this Charm to relocate a region without the proper authorization is a Severity 3 offense.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Hunted Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who was driven from her land.
   Great black stags chased her, and their eyes shone blue.
       Monsters scrambled after her through the bush, though they found her not.
   Stumbling on a log, she fell; and thought to surrender, and end the torment of the hunt; but then, she stood, and stuck out her tongue at the dark woods behind her.
   "Love is smiling at your troubles", she said.</comment>

   Targeting all or most of the same area or landmarks with multiple uses of this Charm in the same day is taxing, on both the world and its Sidereal guardians. Each use in the same 25 hour period after the first costs an extra +5m. Dreams and prayers become jumbled for the inhabitants and Heaven, adding +1 to the difficulty of their Conviction rolls to regain Willpower and any prayer rolls they make for a full week after the last use of this Charm.
   With Essence 7+, Neighborhood Relocation Scheme can be used to relocate characters that exist as living landscapes or structures, such as Mother Bog, as long as they fit completely within the range of this Charm. Such characters may either defend against the Shaping of this Charm with appropriate defenses, or resist with a (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of the Sidereal's (Essence). If they succeed, the Sidereal is unable to make any progress moving them for an hour. After every hour this roll can be repeated, giving the relocated character an opportunity to drag out the location or even cut it short by forcing the Sidereal to take more damage than they can safely withstand.</description>
            <errText>This Charm costs only one bashing health level per hour to maintain. The Sidereal may change pace as she wishes, but she can never stop moving if she wishes to keep the Charm active. The unnatural Illusion of this Charm costs 5wp to resist.</errText>

        <description>This Charm actually represents four separate Charms with a similar effect. Each is based on one of the character's Virtues and uses either that Virtue or a particular Ability to mark its effects, in addition to the basic Integrity and Essence. A player can take the Charm once for each Virtue. The specific Charms are the following:
• Compassionate Essence Replenishment, based on the character's Compassion and Performance;
• Stern Essence Replenishment, based on the character's Conviction and Socialize;
• Heroic Essence Replenishment, based on the character's Valor and Presence; and
• Slick Essence Replenishment, based on the character's Temperance and Bureaucracy.
   To buy each Charm, a character needs at least three dots in the secondary Ability. Each Charm has no cost to use; each Charm permanently enhances the character's capabilities.
   When a character with this Charm channels Willpower through the Virtue that pertains to the Charm and succeeds on her action, she gets back (Virtue x 2) motes of Essence. The character can also use the required additional Ability to gain a smaller Essence replenishment if her action using the Ability supports the theme of the Virtue in a situation where something important is at stake. For instance, if a character with Heroic Essence Replenishment successfully uses Presence to rally for numbers (see Exalted, p. 165) in the face of overwhelming enemy forces, she gains (Virtue) motes. The character cannot gain motes from using the Ability and channeling Willpower through the Virtue on the same roll. The motes can go to either the character's peripheral or personal Essence pools.</description>

            <description>Corruption and vice beset companies of righteous heroes on all sides, but the tricks of Kapula from the far reaches of Chaos or the lies of the Ebon Dragon himself are no match for the mazy reassurances of a Sidereal advisor. This Charm enhances a social group of which the Exalt is a part, as long as he is not the leader. Social attacks targeting the group suffer a -3 external penalty. The Sidereal, acting in his capacity as a Vizier, may perform appropriate stunts to speak out against the offending influence, increasing the penalty by an amount equal to the rating of the stunt.
   Multiple Sidereals may better bolster the resolve of a group. Each extra Vizier that activates this Charm increases the base penalty by one, to a maximum additional penalty equal to the lowest permanent Essence amongst them.</description>

        <description>The character's steadfast resolve and confidence in his destiny shield him from an attempt to change his mind or do him harm. Any player whose character has an Essence less than the Sidereal's Temperance must first succeed on a reflexive Willpower roll before the character attempts a social or physical attack against the Sidereal. If the Willpower roll fails, the attack fails automatically. The Sidereal's apparent steely dedication in the face of opposition cows the attacker so her aim or intention falters. If the Willpower roll succeeds, the attack may proceed, but the Sidereal combines his Parry Defense Value and Dodge Mental Defense Value against the attack.</description>

This Charm imposes an external penalty on a physical or social attack equal to the Exalt's Temperance. Against a physical attack that still hits despite this penalty, he also gains (Essence) bashing and lethal soak.
   With an Integrity 4+, Essence 4+ repurchase the Sidereal may add +1wp to the Cost to speak encouragement into the destiny of an ally within (Essence) yards, allowing them to gain the benefits of this Charm.</description>

        <description>By sheer force of will, the Sidereal forces the area around her to conform to the dictates of fate. When the character enters the Wyld, the Underworld or Malfeas, she carries a measure of Creation with her. Neither the character nor anything within 10 yards of her suffers the effects of exposure to these alien realms. Creation-Preserving Will does not protect against physical or magical dangers such as Wyld-beasts, the acidic waves of the demon-ocean Kimbery or attacks by ghosts, but characters avoid Wyld mutation or recover Essence in the Underworld as they would in Creation. This protection lasts only as long as the character remains conscious and keeps the Essence committed.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal determination to see the Ending allotted to them by Saturn is so strong, they are empowered to eschew the trials of worlds beyond Creation. This Charm enhances its prerequisite, so that in addition to penalizing any attack it is applied against, it negates undesired Shaping that accompanies it. It may also be applied against effects that are not characterdriven attacks, such as Wyld mutation. Against Shaping from sources outside of fate, the Charm’s cost is reduced by 1m; against the Shaping of Sidereal Charms and astrology, it is increased by 1m. This cost variance is considered a special Flaw of Invulnerability.</description>

        <description>The Viziers are deaf to foolish prattle that might sway lesser folk from their duties. The player selects a plan or program endorsed by one of the Sidereal's superiors - from her faction, one of her conventions or her division in the Bureau of Destiny - and forges a supernaturally intense Intimacy to that plan. Any mental influence to betray or abandon that plan becomes an unacceptable order (see Exalted, p. 180).
   The Charm lasts as long as the character maintains that Intimacy or the Vizier's superiors judge the plan completed to their satisfaction. The character can then apply Unhearing Dedication to a new goal once the next story begins. At any time, though, a player can also shift the Charm to a new Intimacy by spending one experience point.</description>

        <description>Whenever a Sidereal who possesses this Charm comes under unnatural mental influence, instead of spending Willpower to resist the influence she may abandon her identity to become someone else - someone who would find the influence an unacceptable order (see Exalted, p. 180). The character keeps her memories and Abilities, but she has a different personality for the next 24 hours, with a different Motivation. Since the new personality might need to be extreme, eccentric or outright psychotic to resist some commands - comparable to a Solar in Limit Break - the Death-of-Self Meditation has its disadvantages. The player may select the character's temporary Motivation, but the Storyteller defines the sort of personality that would have it.</description>

            <description>The world is a place of trials, constantly tearing away what you are to make you who you will be. Let those things go, and they trouble you not! A Sidereal may activate this Charm when faced with unnatural influence, shedding an Intimacy related to it. It does not matter if the Intimacy would have been opposed or complementary to the influence, as long as it would have provided either a bonus or penalty to MDV resisting its imposition. Any such influence is perfectly dodged, spiraling away into nothingness along with the Sidereal's old loves and hates. The lost Intimacy cannot be regained by any means for the rest of the story.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden and the Scythe. The prayer strip rises into the air and hovers near him, dragging trails of violet light in its wake. By that light, and in the name of the Violet Bier of Sorrows, the Sidereal then makes a binding vow to accomplish some important goal.
   That goal can be as great or small as the character pleases. Nonetheless, the character had better be sure she can accomplish it, for her name and very identity are on the line. When the character makes her vow, she forswears these aspects of herself for the duration of the effect. Any roll made to remember her suffers a -3 internal penalty on top of any other penalties the character's Sidereal nature might impose. The character cannot regain her name or identity until she achieves her goal. If the prayer strip is destroyed or if the character ends the Charm prematurely, she cannot become who she used to be. Even worse, she must now complete her goal without the Charm's benefits. (She can't reactivate the Charm because she has no name or identity to pledge as collateral). If circumstances render her goal impossible - if a Demon Prince devours the person the Sidereal vowed to promote to the Scarlet Throne, for instance - the Sidereal's name and identity are lost forever. She might persuade a higher-up in her division to issue her a new identity, but presenting the proper credentials to file the request could prove tricky for a character who officially no longer exists.
   While the character is under this Charm's effects, she cannot perform any action that has no connection to her sworn goal. Rolls for any action that proves beneficial to her sworn goal but serves some other primary purpose suffer a three-dice penalty. On the other hand, any non-aggravated injury inflicted on the character during the Charm's duration heals by one lethal health level or all bashing health levels per action. Aggravated damage heals at one health level per hour. (This benefit applies only to damage incurred after the character activates the Charm. Pre-existing damage heals as normal).</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Maiden's Promise
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who was the living embodiment of everything right in the world.
   While she lived, no real harm could come to anyone.
   Oh, wounds, disease, even death, sure.
   But she stood between the world and anything worse.
   "Except", she said, "I'm going to die". And no one listened.
   "I'm going to die tomorrow", she said. And no one heard.
   Into the silence, she said, "There's always an ending, after all."</comment>

            <description>Activating this Charm, the Sidereal throws into the air a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden's Promise. It hangs for a second, before glowing an arrogant purple and darting about within 100 yards of the Exalt, seeking the best route to the end of his destiny. The Seer defers his name and any claim he has to a life beyond his ultimate purpose, setting them aside as collateral so that the prayer strip can invigorate him and drag him along toward his doom. His identity forgotten by the world, whether he wears a resplendent destiny or not all who meet him are subject to Arcane Fate regarding memories of him, even those who are outside fate or otherwise immune to Arcane Fate normally, such as other Sidereals. This can be avoided temporarily by stealing a name with Name-Pilfering Practice (see page 73), but only so long as he acts the part of the stolen name.
   When an Exalt activates this Charm, he must choose a goal, which then nests in his heart in place of his name. This grants him a sorcerous Intimacy of unceasing dedication to the goal, which cannot be removed by any means. Influence opposing the goal is an unacceptable order. He suffers a -2 internal penalty on actions unrelated to the goal, and a -5 internal penalty on actions contrary to the goal. None of the Exalt's own Charms or other powers can overcome these penalties; he cannot ignore them.
   As recompense, the character gains an extra success on all actions that further the completion of the goal. He ignores any wound or fatigue penalties on actions that are not contrary to the goal, even to the point of continuing to act when he should be unconscious. When performing a stunt that would resonate with the Intimacy if it were a Motivation, the Sidereal converts the stunt's bonus dice into automatic successes, and may as his stunt reward choose to heal one lethal health level of damage or three bashing levels.
   When the Exalt's goal is completed, his name is returned to him as One Direction Invocation ends. This Charm can be ended prematurely, but if so the Exalt's name is not returned; he will need to go to some effort to acquire a new one, often with the aid of relevant gods or other magical authorities. As long as he lacks a name, he is subject to the universal Arcane Fate imposed by use of this Charm. A character without a name cannot reactivate this Charm, even if he steals a replacement.</description>

        <description>This Charm actually represents five separate Charms - one for each Sidereal caste. Each version grants an awareness of astrological details that aid in the completion of destiny's designs. Auspicious Prospects for Journeys reveals when and where someone ought to travel. Auspicious Prospects for Serenity tells whom fate wishes to have joy, as well as how to help such people achieve it. Auspicious Prospects for Battles shows when, where and between whom important conflicts should occur. Auspicious Prospects for Secrets grants insight into whether certain important information should be revealed or obscured. Auspicious Prospects for Endings suggests when a person, thing or idea's time has come. A Sidereal can easily learn the Auspicious Prospects Charm of her own patron Maiden. Learning the corresponding Charms for other Maidens requires permission from the Maiden herself or that of her deputy in the Bureau of Destiny, but Viziers do not risk any censure for using other versions of this Charm.
   Using the Charm requires only a mote of Essence and a successful (Intelligence + Investigation) roll. On a success, the Sidereal gets a sense of whether the fate in question is favorable in terms of the Maiden represented by the caste. Seeing that the favorable fate comes to pass, however, is up to the Sidereal.</description>

        <description>When the character first learns this Charm, a measure of his Essence crystallizes in his mouth in the form of a small emerald pattern spider. The character spits out this indestructible construct, whereupon it immediately dematerializes and attaches itself to a part of his body. Thereafter, the character may spend two motes of Essence to instruct the spirit to fetch some particular piece of information for him. If the information is available and not actively concealed, the spider scuttles away along the weave of fate. The spider returns in the space of a miscellaneous action and whispers the information to the Sidereal.
   The pattern spider can only retrieve simple, objective facts. It can answer questions such as, "What is that shopkeeper's name?" or "When did it last rain in Nexus?" or even "Who stabbed Sesus Lahor?" It cannot answer questions such as, "Does the shopkeeper hate me?" (the spider doesn't read minds), "Who's winning the battle?" (the spider has no strategic sense) or "Who murdered Sesus Lahor?" (murder, unlike stabbing, is a matter of intent). Questions such as, "What is the Bull of the North up to?" usually give unhelpful answers, such as, "Eating lunch". The pattern spider cannot retrieve information that is actively hidden or innately esoteric, such as spells, and the spider does not function in regions where fate's influence is weak, such as the Wyld, shadowlands or Malfeas.
   As an alternative to pulling such answers from the Loom of Fate, the Sidereal can send the spider with a query to her own library, in Creation or Yu-Shan, for her assistants to look up. The answer falls within the spider's purview because the answer is objective information - what the Sidereal's staff can locate in books - rather than anything so nebulous as truth. Such answers take longer to retrieve, of course.</description>

            <errText>This Charm can deliver any single fact that is known to at least 100 people that are part of fate, as long as that fact is not actively concealed or generally lost. As a rough guideline, as long as an uncontested Investigation, Lore or Occult roll, with difficulty 5 or less, could have been validly made within most of Creation, the spider can find and retrieve it from the records of Heaven.
   As an exception to the stricture against finding information that is actively hidden or would otherwise call for a difficulty 6+ roll to find out, the spider can retrieve any information that is currently kept within the Sidereal's personal libraries in Yu-Shan or Creation. This exception does not apply if someone else hid the information in the Sidereal's library.
   The spider travels along the Exalt's own insuperable thread of fate, and can continue to retrieve information even while in Hell or the outer Chaos of the Wyld. Wards against scrying apply against this Charm, but the Sidereal gains (Essence) extra successes on her roll-off.</errText>

        <description>If the Sidereal finds himself frustrated with the minutia of investigation or academic research, he can call forth a loyal helper to assist him. He need only clap his hands over a smallish living plant and activate the Charm. The plant then grows rapidly and twists itself into the shape of a clothed mortal with the Attributes and Abilities of the "Savant" template on pp. 280-281 of Exalted, minus any specialties. This research assistant speaks any languages the Sidereal does, and it is unfailingly helpful in the character's investigation and research efforts. If an attack or some other emergency imperils the assistant, though, it panics and immediately reverts to its plant form on the spot, prematurely ending the Charm.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal writes a prayer strip with the Scripture of That Old Thing as she ponders a specific question or subject of interest to her. The Sidereal buries the prayer strip like a seed and waters it with her own blood. In a single day, the strip sprouts roots and rapidly grows into a tall mulberry tree that attracts the gratified attention of local wood spirits. These spirits either leave small gifts or write secrets on the fallen leaves.
   The Sidereal may return to the site on the fifth day. Her player then rolls (Charisma + Investigation) as the character looks through the wood spirits' offerings. For each success on the roll, the Sidereal finds a piece of information useful to resolving her quandary - some hint about the answer to her question or an idea about where to look for more information - as well as an interesting trinket. These gifts seldom possess significant monetary value... but occasionally turn out to be just what the character needs later.
       Returning to the tree before five days pass offends the spirits before they finish leaving gifts. For each day the Sidereal refuses to wait, remove one success from the player's roll.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of that Old Thing
   Once, there was that old thing...
   ...that wasn't like a shadow, because you could see it too well.
   ...and that wasn't like a light, because it didn't make flowers grow.
   So, it had to be a maiden, but she didn't mind.
   "To know the world is to love it", said she.</comment>

            <errText>The Charm isn't Obvious according to the definition of that keyword. Burying a seed and spilling your blood on it doesn't immediately draw the attention of passers-by and inform them that magic is afoot, and the seed's growth, though fast, is not so fast that it does so either.</errText>

            <errText>The clues and trinkets do not necessarily imply any special knowledge on the part of the wood spirits leaving them. They are compelled by this Charm to find and deposit elements of a prophecy they may have no part in. This unnatural Compulsion targets only minor spirits, and is irresistible. The affected spirits come from within 10 miles; if none are present for any reason, this Charm fails.
   Outside of Creation and Yu-Shan, there are no nature gods to answer the call of the Embracing Life Method, preventing this Charm from functioning unless the Sidereal can make an appropriate stunt to circumvent this limitation. Examples include pouring out extra libations of blood to draw ghosts in the Underworld, or disguising the tree as a metallic sculpture to appease Autochthonian exmachina.</errText>

        <description>Through subtle adjustments to her manner of speaking, the Sidereal makes her statements seem laden with implications that listeners find too horrible or absurd to believe. The Charm supplements social actions using any Ability (and can be part of a Combo with any ability's Charms), but changes the effect of the social action. The Charm adds the character's Larceny in successes to the social Ability roll. If the result exceeds the target's Dodge Mental Defense Value, he thinks he saw through the Sidereal's "lie" and believes that whatever she said isn't true. This may cause the victim to discount other people who sincerely make similar claims; or when the victim discovers that the Sidereal's "unbelievable" statement was true after all, he might be inclined to believe a genuine whopper from the Sidereal.
   Example: Ayesha Ura - concealed by a resplendent destiny as a humble farmer's wife - tells Peleps Deled that Anathema have terrorized the area. She uses Avoiding the Truth Technique while saying this. Since Ayesha wants to persuade Deled, her player rolls (Manipulation + Presence), channels a Willpower through her Conviction (Deled is well-known as a strong-willed man) and adds Ayesha's Larceny in automatic successes. The result just barely overcomes the Dynast's Dodge Mental Defense Value. Deled thinks the "farmwife" is a flibbertigibbet who sees Anathema in every shadow. Thus, the fanatical Immaculate immediately decides the lead that brought him after a suspected Solar was a hoax, and his Wyld Hunt rides away.</description>

            <errText>This Charm enhances social attacks to encourage beliefs. It adds (Essence) successes to the attack, which is compared against the target's Parry or Dodge MDV normally. Success imposes the unnatural Illusion that what the Exalt said is untrue, even if the target would normally believe otherwise. It costs 3wp to ignore this influence. The Charm can also be employed to enhance truths and lies outside of social combat.
   When someone attempts to tell if the character is lying or not (Exalted, p. 131), the difficulty to do so is raised by the Exalt's Essence. Failure to see through the Sidereal's facade imposes this Charm's influence on the observer.</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal makes eye contact with a target for long enough to exchange a few words, however brief, and activates this Charm. When the Sidereal does so, he gets a quick impression of what the target is thinking about at that moment. The target loses his train of thought in that moment as his mind goes blank for the blink of an eye.
   It is impossible to maintain eye contact for long enough to use this Charm if either the target or the Sidereal engages in physical combat. The Sidereal can swipe a target's surface thoughts while either or both of them engage in social combat.</description>

It grants no special insight into whether the Sidereal will interrupt meaningful thoughts, but if properly timed it imposes an external penalty of (her Larceny) on any disrupted knowledge recall and retention rolls. This is a form of unnatural Illusion; spending 2wp to ignore it immunizes one from Thought-Swiping Distraction for the rest of the scene.
   The brief impression the Sidereal receives of the target's surface thoughts include broad strokes only, such as "going to war" or "someone I love". If the target is thinking of the subject of one of their Intimacies that the Sidereal is aware of, the name of the subject is provided as well.</errText>

        <description>The character sweeps a hand through the weave of events, wrapping her fate around that of a target so that certain portions of one strand temporarily become indistinguishable from the other. The player then rolls (Wits + Larceny). If the roll succeeds, the Sidereal can steal a number equal to his Essence from his target's innate bashing and lethal soak, his target's damage dice from all attacks or dice from one of his target's specific dice pools. The target loses the dice or levels of soak for the scene, and the Sidereal gains them in addition to his own. This Charm cannot take more dice or levels from the target than the target has and cannot add more bonus dice to the Sidereal's pool in conjunction with other Charms than the Sidereal has dots of Essence.
   The Sidereal can steal dice from several different targets or steal dice from several of one target's dice pools, but the Sidereal cannot add to his own soak or to any one of his dice pools more than once. Also, he cannot steal dice or soak just to make it disappear from the target: the character must be able to receive and use the stolen dice or levels in order to be able to steal them.</description>

            <description>The character sweeps a hand through the weave of events, wrapping her fate around that of a target so that certain portions of one strand temporarily become indistinguishable from the other. Successfully touching a target, which may require an unarmed attack as part of activating this Charm, the Sidereal rolls her (Wits + Larceny) against the target's Dodge MDV. For every extra success, up to a maximum of (Exalt's Essence), the victim suffers a -1 internal penalty to a chosen (Attribute + Ability) die pool and the Sidereal gains an equal amount of bonus dice to the same pool.
   The Exalt can steal dice from many of a character's pools and from many targets, but she cannot steal from the same pool twice, nor can she steal from the same pool from multiple targets.
   Sidereals with Essence 4+ may add +1wp to the cost of this Charm to steal from targets up to (Essence) yards away. This is a Shaping attack that cannot be blocked or dodged.</description>

            <description>With a sharp yank on a person's fate, the Sidereal can dislodge that person's name and snatch it from her. This Charm functions like Sidereal Shell Games, Crippling the target and removing from them their name. This is not an influence effect - their name is truly disassociated from them, from all perspectives except the Sidereal's. Others cannot call to mind the target's real name. This Charm may be used to steal any name the Sidereal is aware of, including pen names, pet names and diminutives, though each requires a separate use.
   Sidereals who have stolen a name, and made any effort to disguise themselves as the person it belongs to, may use that name freely without equivocation or fear of being found out as a liar. The name does belong to the Exalt, for now, and so he is telling the truth.</description>

        <description>The Essence of dreams is subtler even than fate - too subtle for Sidereals to shape, but not too subtle for them to mangle. The Sidereal attempts the lightest, most surreptitious touch to his victim while her player rolls (Wits + Larceny), against a difficulty equal to the victim's Essence. If the roll succeeds, the Seer slips a net of Essence into her victim - delicate by most standards, but a strangling mesh of cable compared to dreams. The victim can no longer dream while the Sidereal maintains the Essence commitment, and grows listless and distracted. For the Charm's duration, the victim cannot regain Willpower or regenerate his Essence normally. As a dubious benefit, the Fair Folk cannot feed on the victim unless they discern and remove the net of Essence.
   The dream-crushing net becomes more dangerous when used against the Fair Folk themselves, for they are made of dreams. The Charm inflicts a number of dice of aggravated damage equal to the Sidereal's Essence. When that happens, the Fair Folk victim immediately becomes ravenous as well as a bit mad (well, madder than usual), though not so deranged it will not try to avoid further attacks.</description>

This Charm functions like Sidereal Shell games, Crippling the target's capacity to dream. This prevents them from regaining Willpower from sleep, and from respiring motes normally. As dubious consolation, their Willpower and Virtues cannot be eaten by the Fair Folk. Raksha targets are also prevented from regaining health levels of damage from any of their own kinds of rest or Charms, though other magics may still heal them.</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal cloaks herself in Essence infused with tints from outside Creation. This makes her seem like a native of a realm beyond fate: a ghost, a raksha or a demon. The Charm does not let the character impersonate a particular entity, or indeed look radically unlike herself; rather, she looks like herself if she were some sort of human-like demon (such as a neomah), a ghost or one of the Fair Folk.
   The disguise is good enough to fool a casual view. If the character comes under close, prolonged or Essence-enhanced perceptions, however, her player rolls (Wits + Larceny) against the observer's (Perception + [Awareness, Investigation or Occult]) to find out if the disguise stands.
   The basic purchase of this Charm enables a Vizier to disguise herself as one sort of creature outside of fate. Each additional class of entities costs an additional two experience points or one bonus point.</description>

            <errText>This Charm enhances a normal action to adopt a disguise, allowing the Sidereal to appear as nearly any creature outside fate that is at least roughly the same size and shape. Mundane scrutiny fails to pierce the disguise automatically, while magic senses face +2 difficulty on any relevant rolls. This Charm will perfectly conceal the Exalt's nature as a being of fate, adding (his Essence) successes to any roll-off.
   The Sidereal need not purchase each iteration of this Charm separately; any type of creature he is familiar with can be mimicked normally.</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip on which is written the Scripture of the Savory Maiden. The Essence-infused prayer strip goes rigid and affixes itself to the air as if the strip were nailed to a board. As the strip pulses with green light, the Sidereal names a victim within 10 miles. For just a moment, the victim sees a glowing green image of the prayer strip as viewed through the Exalt's eyes. After that, the victim's destiny becomes a bargaining chip between the Maidens and the nameless, formless entities of the deepest Wyld. The Wyld accepts the victim's destiny in exchange for surrendering what seems like a miniscule fraction of the Wyld back into Creation. At the time, the Wyld does not realize - perhaps because it cannot - that its hold over the victim's destiny is temporary, but territory ceded to fixed and stable Creation is lost to it forever. Hindsight reveals the Wyld's folly, however, so the more often a Sidereal tricks the Wyld into this lopsided bargain, the angrier the Wyld grows with her. If she uses this Charm too frequently, the Sidereal will find herself the target of chaotic forces from beyond Creation's rim.
   When the character activates the Charm, her player rolls (Manipulation + Larceny) against a difficulty of her chosen victim's Essence. If the roll succeeds, chaos plagues the victim's destiny for one month per success rolled. Fair Folk or Wyld creatures might seek him out with malicious intent - or (just as bad) to do him what they consider "favors". Or, he might suffer physical or mental mutation: each month, the victim's player rolls to avoid Wyld mutation as if the character was in a Middlemarch... but at difficulty 5. (See Exalted, pp. 288-290, for basic Wyld mutations; additional physical mutations and mental derangements appear in Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II - The Wyldand Manual of Exalted Power: The Lunars). The exact nature of the curse is up to the Storyteller, but the character should be harried or mentally damaged or physically mutated - not all three at once (at least in the same month).
   While this curse lasts, the victim's player can make an extended (Intelligence + Lore) roll once per month for the character to gain an understanding of the curse. With six successes, it occurs to him that the prayer strip he saw when the curse came into effect must have been within 10 miles of him at that point and that destroying the strip would free him. With 12 successes, he figures out its precise location.
   In return for each month of the victim's torment, the Wyld cedes one square mile of the Bordermarches to Creation, or (for an inhabited region) a dominion of Magnitude 0 (see the Exalted Storytellers Companion, p. 133). The Sidereal can specify a region or Wyld-tainted community to bring into Creation.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Savory Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who ate 236 leaves. She had to, because otherwise she'd forget where she came from, and that would make everyone very sad or, possibly, very happy.
   She found herself in a woods full of monsters, impelled toward their cook pot. "Do you want to cook me?" she asked. "Or do you just think that's where maidens belong?"
   There was a crack in the cook pot's bottom that let in the sky.
   She started to squirm through the crack, but then, she saw that the clouds carried chains and the wind was their manacles.
   As the monsters pulled her back, she called to the stones and she called to the sky, but it was the night that came to her aid; and, in the night, fire and pain. "Why should you help me?" she asked.
   "To know the world is to serve it", they said.</comment>

        <description>The Chosen of the Gods honor mere mortals just by acknowledging their existence. A Sidereal can forge a powerful connection to another person just by saying his name in his presence. The Seer's player then rolls her (Charisma + Linguistics) against the target's Dodge Mental Defense Value and adds her Essence in automatic successes. If the roll succeeds while the target is calm, the target feels more connected to and enriched by the Sidereal. He gains a single Intimacy toward the Sidereal for the rest of the scene.
   If the target is upset or hostile toward the Sidereal, the character can use this Charm to calm him. If the roll succeeds, the target's hostility and its cause evaporate from his mind, giving the Sidereal a chance to change the subject or hide whatever set the target off in the first place. Physical evidence of the trigger (seeing a Sidereal climbing out the window while holding the target's newborn infant, for instance) will rekindle the passion in the target. However, this Charm cannot affect an Exalt in Limit Break.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal recites a minute-long blessing in the Old Realm's tongue. (The Charm absolutely requires knowledge of that language). If his player succeeds at an (Intelligence + Linguistics) roll at difficulty 5, the blessing binds together the fates of two creatures (one of whom may be the Seer himself) such that those two creatures can understand each other's speech forever after. This understanding goes only so far as each creature's respective intellect allows, of course. A Sidereal could no more explain the nuances of motonic physics to a Haltan san-monkey than that Sidereal could understand the san-monkey's description of the pheromones that attracted him to his san-monkey mate.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal subjects her victim to a chant whose syllables don't quite form recognizable words in any language, and whose broken rhythm never settles on a meter. Getting the victim to stay nearby for the minute-long chant is left to the character's ingenuity. The target must hear the chant for the Charm to work.
   The Sidereal's player rolls (Wits + Linguistics) against the target's Dodge Mental Defense Value. Success robs the character of one dot of Linguistics. The victim can no longer speak, read or understand one language or language family, chosen by the Sidereal. This may include the character's native tongue, even for a target who speaks no other language.
   Dots of Linguistics do not go away; they are merely suppressed. The character must simply learn how to use the language(s) again, either by immersion in a culture that uses one or more of them or by diligent instruction from a tutor. The target can learn back his languages in any order, but doing so takes time - as much time as gaining the dots of an out-of-caste ability (three weeks to re-learn his native tongue or his first dot of linguistics, one week for the second, two weeks for the third and so on). Learning a new language, one different from any of the ones he lost, requires the actual purchase of a new dot of Linguistics.</description>

            <description>It may seem cruel to take away something old and dear as a trademark phrase, or the intimate dialect of a pair of twins, but sometimes the tree of Serenity grows from a seed of strife. This Charm enhances a social attack targeting an individual that in some way disparages or dismisses a key phrase or even a whole dialect of language. In addition to its other effects, the target unknowingly comes under an unnatural Illusion that strips from them the ability to understand or utilize the chosen phrase or dialect. Certain actions and social attacks may be rendered harder or even impossible. A guard may prevent all from entering a secret meeting, because he cannot recognize the correct pass phrase; a spy who forgets his conspiracy's secret code may find himself shunned or even assassinated.
   Suppressed linguistic traits are not lost; specialties for each dialect are still there. They simply cannot be used while this Charm remains in power. A character may even unlearn that which they do not think they know, shifting their dialect to something else per normal rules for switching specialties.
   The Illusion ensures that the targets of this Charm do not realize that there is anything wrong with themselves. Clearly, everyone else is mistaken or crazy. Recognizing this deception and shedding the Illusion costs 4wp, or 2wp if the target must produce the banned linguistic element to avoid physical harm.
   A repurchase at Linguistics 4+, Essence 4+ grants two new capabilities. The Sidereal may suppress entire language families in targets (i.e., the ability granted by each dot of Linguistics), or may attempt to suppress phrases or dialects in all listeners with a Performance-based social attack. At Essence 5+ these two options can be combined, suppressing language families in whole crowds.</description>

        <description>This Charm links the Sidereal and another person in bonds of fate. The two characters need not actually be wed or even in love for the Charm to work, however. They must merely give assent of their own free will and understand how completely their oath shall join them. Still, the bond is sacred in the eyes of the Maidens, so it behooves the Sidereal not to treat it frivolously.
   To sanctify the Lover's Oath, the Sidereal writes the Scripture of the Bride on a prayer strip. She wraps the strip around her hand and her partner's hand. As she does so, she recites an oath in Old Realm and makes the proper expenditures. Her player and her partner's player then roll (Intelligence + Linguistics). If between them their rolls garner five successes, the oath is sanctified and recognized. In a flash, the prayer strip splits and transforms into two starmetal rings set with sapphires, one on each participant's finger. (This event is Obvious, but the subsequent effects of the Charm are not). Thereafter, neither character can attempt to remove her or her partner's ring. Either ring can be destroyed, but only by using the same rules that govern breaking an activated prayer strip.
   Once the oath is joined, each character can use the other's Essence, Willpower and even health levels as her own (as long as her partner has them to spend). Motes drawn from the other person count as peripheral for the character using them. Using a partner's health levels effectively shunts damage from one person to the other at the behest of the person doing the shunting. The recipient has no say in the matter (at least not where the rules are concerned). The recipient cannot transfer a wound back, either. That is, a wound can be transferred from one partner to the other only once. If one partner is wounded such that he has a more severe wound penalty than the other partner, new damage that is notinflicted by transfer via this Charm transfers to his partner automatically until their wound penalties equalize.</description>

   Once, there was a Maiden...
   ...who fled a shadow, in the company of a friend.
   They traveled through strange places, and among strange people".

            <description>The Sidereal Lover's Oath is a bold declaration of the need one can feel for another, even at the expense of life itself. Use of this Charm requires binding a prayer strip around the hands of the participants in celebration of their partnership, officiated by the Sidereal. The prayer strip becomes a pair of starmetal rings adorning the finger of each of the two participants, affirming their pledge.
   If the Sidereal binds herself to a partner with an Essence pool, both the Sidereal and her lover gain ten-mote Overdrive pools, which come into existence containing ten motes. If the Sidereal's partner has no Essence pool, then only the Sidereal gains the pool. If the Sidereal is binding two other characters with this Charm, then no pool is created.
   While this Charm persists, the lovers may reflexively protect one another with Defend Other actions whenever they are within (Dexterity) yards of each other. Whenever such a Defend Other action is used successfully, the protector gains one offensive mote.
   Should an enemy manage to strike one of the lovers through such a Defend Other action, the defender may reflexively accept as many levels of the damage as she desires herself; for each level of damage she takes onto herself, the protected lover gains two overdrive motes.
   Additionally, the ring produced by this Charm gleams brightly whenever the character's partner is in the grip of some powerful emotion; by paying one Willpower, the character may experience whatever emotion her partner is feeling (discovering whether it is pain, joy, sadness, etc), though no context is gained.
   Finally, after a scene in which one of the lovers has defended her partner in some way (whether through violence or social action), the defender may roll (higher of Compassion or Conviction) to regain Willpower as though from a night's sleep. This benefit may apply no more than once per season.
   A character may be subject to no more than a single Lover's Oath at a time. The Charm’s effects end when either partner removes their ring voluntarily, or when one of the rings is destroyed (treat as attempting to destroy a prayer strip).
   Venus frowns on frivolous use of this Charm. While there are no direct mechanical repercussions for crass and utilitarian use of Lover's Oath, misfortune has been observed to follow those who cavalierly bind their fates together.</description>

        <description>In the character's sleep, the Maiden of Secrets reveals to him her plan for fate. If the character spends five motes of Essence as he receives this vision, he understands how he fits into this grand plan and what he can do to best integrate himself into the Maiden's efforts. When he wakes, the character has access to three relevant bonus specialties he may divide among up to three Abilities of the Sidereal's choosing. The dice from these specialties may also apply to the effect roll for any Sidereal astrology that involves the college corresponding to a selected Ability.
       Keep in mind, however, that characters using this Charm are still limited to a maximum +3 bonus from specialties to any given roll. Also, bonus dice granted from these specialties count as bonus from Charms. The Ability or Abilities the character chooses need not be the same each time the character activates the Methodology of Secrets, but the character cannot change which trait receives the benefit until the next time he sleeps (and uses the Charm again).</description>

        <description>Upon the paths of fate travels the Heptarchy of Tragedy - a group of seven gods responsible for those truths and futures that displease mortal eyes. When the Heptarchs perceive atrocities yet to come, they bundle knowledge in a living sepulcher and bury it in the earth. They might not be able to avert such a tragedy, but at least they can hide knowledge of it from those eyes the tragedy would most offend. Determined Sidereals can dredge up these sepulchers, however, and bear witness to the truths best left unspoken that are hidden in futurity.
       Viewing the unpleasant future requires that a Sidereal engage in a three-hour astrological meditation in the company of at least two other Sidereals. The other Sidereals do not need to know this Charm, but all the participants must be of different castes. The rite must be performed beneath the starry sky. The Charm unearths a buried sepulcher and grants the participants a vision of its hidden contents, from a perspective at the end of the Age of Sorrows. The participants must agree on a general topic for their prognostication, such as "Nexus" or "the Bull of the North".
       Properly interpreting this glimpse requires the character's player to roll (Intelligence + Lore) at the end of the three-hour meditation. The more successes each player gets, the more clearly the character perceives the connection between the coming tragedy and current events.
   A character can use this Charm no more than once per month. Repeated attempts to investigate a future tragedy do not grant further information.</description>

        <description>Whispering a long, soundless string of words that even the Sidereal himself does not understand, the character reveals to a god or elemental of Earth a secret about the world's destiny. The spirit glows faintly green as it internalizes this secret, then the spirit can never repeat the secret to anyone. In return for this revelation, the spirit owes the Sidereal one important favor to be called in by fate itself when the time is right. The Sidereal does not know the nature of this favor, and neither does the spirit, until the time is right - neither one chooses it.
   Until the spirit repays the favor, the spirit cannot initiate hostile action against the character without a successful (Wits + Temperance) roll, difficulty 3. The spirit can answer in kind if the character initiates the hostile action, though.
   In theory, a Sidereal can accumulate as many divine favors as he wants. In practice, the Bureau of Heaven grows suspicious if a Vizier piles up debts of favors from too many gods.</description>

        <description>The Seers of Heaven research the future as well as the past. By studying the patterns of fate weaving through a person, place or object, a Sidereal gains information about the target's future. The Sidereal's player rolls (Intelligence + Lore); each success gives one fact about the target, such as "This artifact will pass to a Lunar", "Your future holds a green-haired man" or "Army coming through!" Unfortunately, the Charm does not always say when an event takes place: asking for possible events within any given one-year time span raises the difficulty to 3, and a one-month time span forces a difficulty of 5. A full month must pass before another use of the Charm can reveal new information about the target. The Sidereal's own actions may change the foreseen events.</description>

        <description>Beneath starry skies or at the Loom of Fate, the Sidereal and at least two fellow Viziers meditate upon a goal important to them and chart the surest course of destiny that will see that goal accomplished. Other participants do not need to know the Charm, but all participants must be of different castes. When the character invokes the Charm, the player rolls (Intelligence + Lore) against a difficulty set by how broad and sweeping the goal is. If the roll succeeds, the character sees one true path that undeniably leads to the accomplishment of that goal... as well as the price she must pay to see it done. The price might be anything from "minor bodily harm" to "the sacrifice of your families, your morals, and eventually your lives" - depending, again, on how epic the goal is.
   If the player agrees that the character will pay the price, the character's achieving the goal is assured. In most cases, the troupe still plays out the actions needed to bring about the conclusion; the result is assured, but the route might hold surprises, and other storylines and conflicts still claim the character's attention. In other cases, though, the Storyteller might simply narrate the scenes that lead to the accepted resolution, in between other scenes. Of Things Desired and Feared can resolve a peripheral subplot or a side quest that proves unintentionally tedious in play. Under no circumstances does the Charm grant an "automatic-win" option to a lazy player. The steep cost of victory should rarely be desirable over the character's own careful planning and hard work.</description>

This is a very loose guideline, and Storytellers are encouraged to ignore it if the conflict is incidental to their story or would be uninteresting in extended play.</errText>

        <description>The character weaves a net of destiny with filaments thinner than spiderweb, yet stronger than malice, and casts the net over any target the character can see. Doing so requires a successful (Dexterity + Lore) roll, with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. The invisible net adheres to the target, exerting a subtle gravity on the world around the target. Normally, this effect lasts for one year and one day, but if the Sidereal spent a permanent dot of Willpower, the effect lasts for as long as it must in order to fulfill its purpose.
   Thereafter, in a circumstance the Sidereal chose when she performed this Charm, every dice pool that directly opposes the target of the net enjoys a -1 target number reduction (to a minimum of 4). This curse upon the target lasts for one scene. Multiple nets can affect the same victim, but only if they come from different characters and have different triggering circumstances. The net cannot adhere to Incarnae, or to Yozis, Neverborn and other transcendent entities.
   The resemblance to Sidereal astrology is, of course, obvious. Of Horrors Best Unknown gives the Five-Score Fellowship one means to affect the fates of entities from beyond Creation, albeit possibly at a high price. The mys-tic net also has a little-known but even greater function: if a targeted creature from outside fate sacrifices a dot of Willpower, the Charm permanently binds the creature to the Loom; the creature is no longer outside of fate, though the creature retains all its former powers.</description>

        <description>When the Sidereal pours her Essence into a prayer strip of the Scripture of the Maiden in Terror, the prayer strip glows a hideous green, then twists itself up and disappears into her palm like a worm burrowing into her flesh (the only Obvious aspect of the Charm). All that remains is a faint impression of the words of the scripture.
   At a time of the Sidereal's choosing, she can reveal the scripture to a single victim and name that victim's unpleasant fate. The Sidereal's player rolls (Intelligence + Lore) as the character describes to her victim how the victim's worst fear is, in fact, written into his destiny. The victim immediately loses a number of Willpower points and motes of Essence equal to the Sidereal's Essence plus the successes on the roll. (This effect reduces the affected pools to a minimum of zero).
   Worse yet, the Sidereal's proclamation of the victim's fate - designed in narrative terms by the player, with the Storyteller's approval - is guaranteed in the victim's destiny. His fate might not play out immediately, or quite the way the Sidereal expects, but as long as no one tampers with the Loom of Fate or invites the interference of creatures outside of fate, the victim's destiny will come to pass in the his lifetime.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Maiden In Terror
   Once there was a maiden...
   ...who knew some things about a man. He didn't like that, but he kissed her anyway. She told him everything in her heart:
   She whispered truths to him, but he didn't care.
   She whispered hopes to him, but he didn't care.
   She whispered her prayers, but heard only silence.
   And she whispered her fear to him, but he didn't care.
   He looked upon her inner self, and the void met his eyes.
   "To know the world is to fear it", said he.</comment>

        <description>With a touch, the Sidereal can instantly and painlessly kill a living creature that consciously and freely wants to die. No drug, Charm or unnatural mental influence can create such willingness where one doesn't already exist: the death wish must be the target's own. (Admittedly, the Sidereal or his agents can make the target's life such a living hell that death seems preferable). The higher soul of the deceased is drawn off into the cycle of reincarnation. The Charm's target cannot rise again as a ghost or zombie.</description>

            <description>Calling upon the mercy that the Maiden of Endings shows for those in her somber dominion, the Sidereal may take away the suffering that accompanies death. As she touches a character, she brings an ending to the pain they might feel, negating any wound penalties they would suffer for the duration of this Charm. Characters who die under the effects of Peaceable Conclusion feel no pain as they pass, and their souls pass into Lethe without regret. The corpses of characters who die such a death can never be raised as undead.
   Peaceable Conclusion has the opposite effect when used on a creature of death, suffusing them with the stillness of the grave. Such characters suffer a -3 internal penalty on all non-reflexive actions as a Crippling effect for the duration of this Charm.</description>

        <description>This Charm extends the effect of Peaceable Conclusion to creatures at the Incapacitated health level or who are dying. The person must be willing to die or be unconscious, however. Should the target's body lie upon naked earth or stone when the Sidereal uses the Charm, the body sinks into the surface, burying itself.
       More importantly, anyone slain by this Charm cannot rise again, in body or spirit, to trouble the living: the Loom of Fate ties the person to Creation's proper cycle of death and reincarnation. If the Sidereal uses this Charm on a zombie, it remembers that it is dead, collapses in a heap and buries itself. Using Smooth Transition on the corpse of a troublesome ghost or hungry ghost can banish that ghost to the Underworld until the next night - but only if the Sidereal's player wins a resisted (Charisma + Medicine) roll against the ghost's (Willpower + Essence). Unusual corpses such as spine chains, however, are immune to Smooth Transition. The necromancy that animates them is too strong for the Loom to overcome.</description>

            <description>When ghosts and the walking dead linger on in the lands of the living, it falls upon Saturn's Chosen to guide them back to their ordained endings. Smooth Transition can supplement any attack against a creature of death, causing it to deal aggravated damage and adding one automatic success to the damage roll. Undead extras hit by the attack are automatically destroyed: zombies fall apart as they remember that they are dead, while ghosts pass peacefully into Lethe.
   At first, Saturn's Chosen were confounded by the presence of this Charm in the Scripture of the Maiden and the Road, not knowing what their patron might have intended for it. When the first Neverborn fell, they understood, and used Smooth Transition to purge the hekatonkires and shambling horrors left in its wake.</description>

        <description>The Exalted did not need to fight ghosts at the start of the Primordial War, because the Underworld did not yet exist. Later, the Maidens saw the need for Charms to affect the restless dead.
   A bright flash of violet light radiates from the Sidereal to fill an area (character's Essence x 10) yards in radius. He brings a Smooth Transition to all valid targets in that area. Zombies collapse, and ghosts might vanish to the Underworld. The Sidereal's player makes a single (Charisma + Medicine) roll for all targets.</description>

            <description>Creation is wounded by the taint of death, falling into rot and ruin where the nightlands encroach upon its boundaries. What the world needs now is healing. Activating this Charm, the Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Medicine). Violet radiance flashes forth from his hands and eyes, dealing a single level of aggravated damage to all creatures of death within (Essence x 10) yards who have an Essence rating lower than the rolled successes. Undead extras are destroyed automatically as described in Smooth Transition.
   In addition, the Sidereal may choose to commit the mote cost of this Charm indefinitely, evoking an aura of violet Essence that radiates out to (Essence x 10) yards. Within this Shaping aura, shadowlands behave as though they were a natural part of Creation.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal can use this Charm when a person is suffering from some normal disease -i.e., not a Charm's Sickness effect or the effects of an infectious martial art (from Scroll of the Monk, pp. 153-154). The Sidereal makes the Inferior Sign of the Corpse over the sick person, targeting the least god of that person's illness. The Sidereal's player rolls (Intelligence + Medicine + Essence) against the disease's listed Difficulty to Treat. If the roll succeeds, the illness's least god relinquishes its hold on the victim, and the victim begins to recover.</description>

        <description>Fate decrees that attacks cause wounds, but the Loom of Fate records a creature's previous condition. The Sidereal carefully twists the weave of fate to remove a creature's wounds - but they are only held in a side-loop of fate, and inevitably return in a few hours. Each use of this Charm pushes one level of damage (Wits + Medicine) hours into the future, when the target's flesh reopens and he suffers normal wound penalties. (The Charm also, incidentally, defers poisons and environmental damage). If the target has suffered additional wounds since then, the consequences may be unfortunate.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the Maiden and the Road. She infuses the prayer strip with Essence, buries the strip seven yards beneath the ground and then covers the strip's gravesite with stones. Ten beams of violet light shine from the cairn to encircle the precariously perched star of a god or elemental of earth or air that must soon face death. (The Storyteller selects which type of spirit). Within the next 24 hours, the whispers of the Maiden of Endings lead the Sidereal and the spirit to each other.
   When they meet, the Sidereal offers the spirit the bargain that gives this Charm its name. If the spirit refuses, it dies in that same scene, and the spirit's star falls from the heavens. If the spirit accepts, it vanishes from sight and binds itself to the Sidereal's destiny.
   Once the spirit accepts the bargain, the spirit remains bound to the Sidereal for as long as the Sidereal keeps the Essence committed. During that time, the Sidereal reflexively recovers one lethal or bashing health level per action. Also, the spirit's connection provides an additional +4L/+4B of soak. (The extra soak this Charm grants is not compatible with the use of armor).
   If she wants, the Sidereal can transfer the bond of fate between herself and the spirit to someone else, effectively binding the spirit to that person. (Neither the spirit nor the other person has any say in the matter). For as long as the Sidereal continues to commit the Essence to maintain the Charm, the recipient of the bond enjoys the aforementioned benefits. Once the Sidereal transfers the bond, however, she cannot take it back. The person who received the bond cannot transfer it to anyone else, either.
   Once the Charm's effect ends, the spirit is reborn from within its host, slightly changed but no longer facing imminent death. Whether the spirit feels indebted to the Sidereal depends largely on the spirit's own nature, the length of the spirit's servitude and whether the Sidereal herself placed the spirit's life in jeopardy as a way to force the bargain.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Maiden and the Road
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who found herself climbing up an earthen path.
   Her footsteps made no sound. There was a silence in the air.
   She walked for years, and then, came to a cliff.
   The road gave way to clouds, and she could go no farther.
   "There's always an ending", she said.</comment>

        <description>Uncertain fates may offer several equally attractive options in parallel. A Seer with this Charm need not choose one option over the others. Instead, he takes every available option. When the character activates this Charm, he can take two extra attack actions using Archery, Martial Arts, Melee or Thrown, ignoring multiple-action penalties and his attacks' listed Rate.
   This Charm may be in Combos with Charms of other combat Abilities. Each attack used in the magical flurry must use the same Ability and weapon, though.</description>

   With Essence 4+, a Sidereal may add +1wp to this Charm's cost to counter attacks that do not target her, as long as she could otherwise validly respond if she were the target. Any Counterattacks from the true target take precedence and prevent the Sidereal's counter.

        <description>With a flick of his wrist, the Sidereal uses his weapon to separate the conjoined strands of fate that allow others to attack him. His weapon trails streamers of red stardust that are visible only to creatures that can see dematerialized spirits, and that dust parts the offending strands of fate. When that happens, the character instantaneously reduces the number of successes on an incoming attack to zero, provided that attack has a physical component and is not unblockable. Keep in mind that some Charm-supplemented attacks can hit even with zero successes (such as Accuracy Without Distance, on p. 187 of Exalted). Also, keep in mind that while the character invokes the Charm on Step 2 of combat, the Charm's effects take place in Step 3 and Step 4.</description>

        <description>As with Impeding the Flow, the character's weapon trails evanescent streamers of crimson stardust, visible only to those who can see dematerialized spirits. This dust parts not only the most obvious conjunctions of fate that bind the character to her attackers, but the subtlest ones as well. This Charm is a parry that perfectly defends against any attack, even if it is unblockable. The Sidereal's player may even invoke Serenity in Blood to block unexpected attacks, although in those cases, the player must succeed at a (Perception + Melee) roll at difficulty 3 for the parry to be effective.

        <description>In the stress of battle, the Vizier draws calm and control from his connection to fate. Each mote spent on this Charm cancels -1 penalty on an attack, such as from wound penalties, multiple action penalties or sensory deprivation penalties, as long as those penalties have not reduced the attack dice pool to zero. This Charm may apply to any attack, not just Melee, and can be part of a Combo with other combat Abilities.</description>

            <description>Mighty as the blessings of the Maidens may be, the true weapon of the Sidereal Exalted is neither fist nor daiklave nor destiny nor even Essence - it is the world itself and their ability to shape it. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Whenever the Sidereal successfully blocks an attack using her Parry DV while taking a Defend Other action to protect an individual she has instructed in some way in the past, or when such an individual protects her the same way, she gains two offensive motes. "Instruction" in this case includes not only characters who have learned Charms, sorcery, or new Abilities or Specialty dots from the Sidereal, but also those that have significantly benefitted from her advice or stratagems, at the Storyteller's discretion.
   Additionally, the Sidereal gains the ability to spend her Overdrive motes to fuel the attacks of not only herself, but also of former students (as defined above) within (Essence x 50) yards.</description>

        <description>When the character's weapon finds its mark the victim sees the world with a reddish tint for just a moment as his own Essence reflects the wrath of the Maiden of Battles. On a successful attack, the Sidereal halves the post-soak damage the attack inflicts, rounding down, but turns the damage aggravated.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal channels Essence into a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden, then places the strip across his eyes like a blindfold. It adheres there, and dark blood drips from beneath it, running down the character's face like tears. The strip does not hinder his vision, however. Instead, the prayer strip makes the patterns of his foes' fates - or the disruptions in the strands of fate caused by creatures outside fate - more apparent to him. (Supernatural stealth or concealment effects still work against him as normal).
   While the Charm is in effect, the character doubles his Parry Defense Value against all blockable attacks and suffers no onslaught penalty to his Parry Defense Value. Also, once per action, he can make a reflexive Archery, Martial Arts, Melee or Thrown attack at his full dice pool - but not during the same action in which he performs a flurry. He could, however, reflexively attack once with his sword (and parry any incoming attack with twice his Defense Value) while concentrating on riding a wild horse through a storm of flaming arrows.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who sat on a child's shelf and watched the entire world.
   Her eyes were made of glass,
   And their pupils were red.
   Her mouth was sewn on.
   For years and years, she did not move.
   Then, when necessary, she was gone, and the head of that child with her.
   "Survival is control", she said.</comment>

        <description>The Sidereal makes of his caste mark a lantern that can reveal unmanifested spirits. The mark glows with the color associated with his caste and is visible to spirits and to Chosen of his caste. Anyone who can see the light can also see any unmanifested spirits within (Essence x 5) yards on whom the light shines. The light also grants the Sidereal a single automatic success on any Presence, Performance, Occult, Bureaucracy or Socialize roll the player makes when the character deals with gods or elementals. This automatic success stacks with automatic successes from other sources, and does not count as dice gained through Charms.</description>

        <description>Charms, sorcery, supernatural effects and the presence of spirits (materialized or not) all affect the strands of fate all around them. These effects exert miniscule pulls against the strands, causing them to vibrate at specific frequencies and ring musically in the Sidereal's ears, surrounding him with a symphony of information.
   Once he can hear this music, the Sidereal needs to decipher it. Doing so requires a reflexive (Intelligence + Occult) roll at difficulty 3. If the roll succeeds, the character can identify the details of a Charm, spell or other supernatural effect - such as the power level, range, activation cost and what sort of being it's typically associated with. He can recognize Charms and spells he's seen before. The Sidereal can also use this Charm to determine the approximate rank and occupation of a present spirit.</description>

            <description>Patterns of Essence become music to the Sidereal's ears, untangling the mysterious threads of fate with the revelation of their song. Charms, sorcery, and other magic give off a strange music that is nevertheless fitting to their aspect and nature. Spirits ring with the soft tintinnabulation of bells, while artifacts hum in low tones. Other than its purely auditory nature, this Charm functions as All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight (Exalted, p. 222).</description>

        <description>A Sidereal can invoke his Maiden's authority to facilitate polite dealings with elementals and gods. Any spirit whose Essence does not surpass the Sidereal's must remain calm, reasonable and peaceful in the Vizier's presence. The spirit must spend two Willpower points to initiate violence against the Seer, and any Charm the spirit uses against the character costs one additional Willpower. (This includes Charms that normally do not cost Willpower at all). The effect ends automatically if the Sidereal opens hostilities himself.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal tugs on the weave of a victim's fate and part of the victim's very pattern unravels. The victim (be it a creature or object) need only be in the Sidereal's line of sight when he activates the Charm. The Charm inflicts a number of dice of aggravated damage equal to the Sidereal's Essence, and the damage cannot be blocked or soaked. Only Charms or other effects that protect a character from Shaping effects can defend against this Charm. Unfortunately, a bit of the Sidereal's own fate-pattern unweaves as well.</description>

        <description>Perhaps the greatest power the Maidens give to their Chosen is the power to give a god new responsibilities - and, therefore, a new nature. Yu-Shan holds many gods left beggared and homeless when the Great Contagion and the Fair Folk Invasion destroyed the gods' former purviews. The Sidereals sometimes recruit such gods by offering them the chance to become the god of something again.
   The Sidereal writes the Scripture of the Maiden in Chains on a prayer strip, signs it and offers it to a target god. The god signs, and the Essence-infused paper vanishes in an emerald flash, to reappear in a certain office at the Bureau of Heaven. The god instantly gains the new office granted by the Vizier (possibly with minor alterations to the god's innate powers if the Storyteller considers this appropriate), but no change in its Attributes or Abilities. Prudent Sidereals choose gods who already have some qualifications for their new posts. For their part, prudent gods ask what sort of duty the Sidereal intends for them before they sign.
   The Charm functions only if the recipient deity signs of his own free will. A Sidereal might pressure a god through threats, but such action is a Severity 5 offense if the Bureau of Heaven notices this infringement on the Bureau's prerogatives.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Maiden in Chains
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...and before her came all the peoples of Creation, and knelt.
   They set aside their petty squabbles in her name.
   They acclaimed her with many shouts.
   They prayed for her safety and her weal.
   Not one of them struck free her chains.
   "To know the world..."
   "...is to own it", she said.</comment>

        <description>When the Sidereal participates in a ceremony - anything from a newborn's naming to a funeral - her involvement confers an orthodoxy that pleases Heaven. Her player rolls (Charisma + Performance + Essence) at a difficulty equal to (8 - the Resources expended on the ceremony). If the roll fails, the ceremony is still complete, but does not attract any notice from the Celestial Bureaucracy. If the roll succeeds, the authorities in Heaven look favorably on the ceremony's participants. For the next week, the people for whom the Sidereal performed the ceremony - a wedded couple, the children who commissioned their father's funeral or the like - enjoy a +1 bonus on any dice roll meant to represent their efforts. The successful prayer also grants a broader blessing of harmony and joy to the participants that goes beyond anything dice pools can represent: the dutiful children divide the estate without bickering, the newlyweds are assured of fertility and so on.</description>

            <description>In a harmonious universe, the decrees of the Chosen of the Maidens are as mandates from Heaven, never to be deviated from by villain or happenstance. This Charm enhances the act of officiating or performing a social ritual, one that reasonably evokes hope or desire for an associated goal. Examples include an adulthood rite seeking success for the young celebrant, a wedding seeking happiness for the new couple, the beginning of a funeral procession to Sijan, the christening of a new merchant sailing vessel with dreams of good fortune, or a prayer to these same ends (Exalted, p. 132). The roll to officiate the ceremony automatically succeeds if it would otherwise fail, with 0 threshold successes.
   So long as the ceremony is carried out successfully, the Exalt and all participants are wrapped up in the inevitability of the beneficiary's good future. They effectively gain the benefits of an appropriate Motivation to fulfill an extrapolated goal of the ceremony: to bring the dead body to Sijan, or to help the young adult succeed in making a name for himself. This allows related stunts to resonate and gain a bonus die, and for those pursuing the goal to regain Willpower when they make progress. This benefit lasts no more than one story, and no character may be caught up in more than one use of this Charm at a time.</description>

        <description>Not every person in Creation has a glorious destiny, but every person can live up to his destiny with grace. One of the duties of the Chosen of Venus, then, is to see that mortals and Exalted all live up to their potential.
   A Sidereal uses this Charm while he gives a performance of some kind, such as singing, dancing, reciting an epic poem or the like. Audience members feel the sense of completion, triumph and peace - the exaltation - that comes from knowing you are exactly where you should be, doing what you should do. The Seer's player rolls (Charisma + Performance) against the highest Dodge Mental Defense Value of his assembled audience. If the roll succeeds, everyone who witnessed the Exalt's entire performance (and is not a creature outside fate) gains a temporary Willpower point. A person can receive this bonus from the same Exalt only once per day, but the extra point can put the person over his Willpower maximum for the scene.</description>

   This Charm enhances a social attack that encourages belief or behavior. Those that are convinced by the Sidereal and who do not spend Willpower to resist regain 1wp, even if this would grant them more than their normal maximum. Characters that accept this reward cannot later resist the influence in any way for the rest of the scene. A character cannot gain more than 1wp per scene from this Charm.</description>

        <description>Moving with the tempo of her opponent's actions, as if the two of them were lifelong dance partners, the Sidereal can predict the perfect completion of any attack that opponent launches. She can also make certain that this perfect completion does not involve her. For the rest of the scene, the character adds her Performance score to her Dodge in calculating her Dodge Defense Value. Also, the character can use either her Performance or Dodge Excellencies (but not both) to increase her Dodge Defense Value static value. This new Defense Value ignores onslaught penalties and reduces the Defense Value penalty of any attack the character makes by one (to a minimum of zero).</description>

            <errText>The Exalt does not add her Performance to her Dodge; instead, she may use the higher of her Dodge or Performance to calculate her Dodge DV. Rather than ignoring all onslaught penalties, she ignores up to (Performance) points worth of penalties to her Dodge DV, from any source, apart from penalties from her own actions which are ignored separately. If the Sidereal is protecting someone with a Defend Other action, she may apply this benefit to both her own and her ward's DVs, even when parrying.</errText>

        <description>By singing to a god or elemental in the sacred language of the Old Realm, the Sidereal can remove any stress of confusion or fear, putting the spirit into a calm, cooperative frame of mind.
   To instill this agreeable demeanor, the Sidereal's player rolls (Manipulation + Performance) against the spirit's Dodge Mental Defense Value while the Vizier sings to the spirit. If the roll succeeds, the spirit becomes an ally of the Sidereal, per the Background, and gains an Intimacy to that effect. This alliance lasts until the end of the current story, at which point the spirit resumes its normal feelings for the Sidereal. If the Sidereal treats the spirit especially well during the story and the alliance worked out especially well for the spirit, the alliance could become permanent.</description>

        <description>This Charm involves a complicated song in Old Realm. The song takes a full hour to perform, and mastering its complexities and subtleties requires a successful (Intelligence + Performance) roll at difficulty 9. Additional Sidereals can add their voices in support, even if they do not have the Charm themselves. Eclipse and Moonshadow Caste Exalted may support the Sidereal as well, but they must know the Charm and the Old Realm language to assist. Each supporter reduces the difficulty by one, to a minimum of 5.
   A successful binding summons an elemental with an Essence no higher than that of the character using the Charm. For one season, that spirit is bound by the words to seek the joy, health and pleasure of a particular dominion (as defined by the Mandate of Heaven system from Exalted Storyteller's Companion) assigned by the Sidereal. The dominion's Magnitude may not exceed the Sidereal's Essence. When that time is up, memories of who summoned and bound the spirit slip from the spirit's mind, and the spirit is free to go.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm using a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Dancer. When she wraps the prayer strip around her eyes and infuses it with Essence, the strip becomes a band of starmetal and blue jade. (This event is Obvious, but subsequent Charm effects are not). The prayer strip remains as durable as any other activated prayer strip (see p. 125), but it can be pulled from the character's head if someone's attack manages to get past the Sidereal's defenses and the strip's own Parry Defense Value. If the band comes off the Sidereal's head for any reason, the Charm's effect ends.
   The Exalt is blind to Creation while she wears the prayer strip (with all the normal penalties to physical actions), but her words ring with the power of higher truth and ageless wisdom. Any Performance roll for the character (including Charms) automatically succeeds with one success for every die. Anyone who pays attention to the Sidereal's performance immediately gains an Intimacy to this performer who speaks with the voice of Heaven. Finally, the static values of the Sidereal's Dodge Defense Value and Dodge Mental Defense Value increase by an amount equal to her unmodified Performance, as fate itself strives to protect the source of such blessed assurance.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Dancer
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who stood at the center of every dance.
   Back then, she knew all the dances.She never missed a step.
   One day, she heard something in the music, as a singer dropped the beat.
   It taught her of the joy of dancing poorly.
   She started dancing more and more awry.
   "Love has no rules", she said.</comment>

            <errText>This Charm does not automatically impose Intimacies. Any character successfully influenced by the Exalt is also subject to an unnatural Emotion effect of complete trust for the Sidereal. In addition to suffering the usual penalties for acting contrarily (see page 10), targets halve their MDVs against further social attacks from the Vizier for the rest of the scene, and in turn add two extra successes to any of their own social attacks to impose complementary influence that spreads the Sidereal's own messages and goals. Ignoring the influence for one action costs 1wp, and after doing so five times it cannot take hold again for the rest of the scene.</errText>

        <description>When people face choices, wise Viziers shape the people's decisions. The Sidereal subtly channels Essence into a victim so he makes the decision that the Seer wants. At the time, the decision seems perfectly natural to the target character forced to make it, though he might come to regret it later and wonder what possessed him to choose as he did. The Seer's player need merely succeed at a (Manipulation + Presence) roll at a difficulty of the target's Essence; the character can affect anyone she can see.
   The Charm works only on people who really are weighing different options: it can't force a person to drop whatever he's doing to go do something else. Any decision imposed must be at least a plausible option in the circumstances: when the Regent ponders what wine to have with dinner, you can't make him decide to declare war on Thorns. Worst of all, the Charm doesn't hold the target to his decision. Habitual wafflers may still change their minds a few minutes later. (Bronze Faction Sidereals have learned that using Force Decision on Regent Fokuf is futile and unnecessary: he agrees with whatever anyone suggests... and changes his mind the next time anyone speaks).</description>

        <description>After one scene of social interaction, the Sidereal can make the strands of a victim's fate resonate with the Sidereal's own. The Sidereal picks a time or circumstance when the target makes a social attack. At that time, the Sidereal's personality overwhelms the victim and works itself out through his actions. The victim's will is his own, but the psychic resonance lends his actions the emotional weight that the Sidereal wants.
   When the circumstance in question arises, the Sidereal's player specifies his character's intent and makes a single Bureaucracy, Performance, Presence or Socialize roll - the same as the victim's - with a difficulty of the target's Essence. Success means that the victim's actions convey the effect of the Sidereal's intent as if the Sidereal were present and taking the actions himself. If a critical vote comes up in the Greater House of the Deliberative, for instance, the Sidereal can use this Charm to lend his oratorical skills to a senator who intends to make a speech in line with the Sidereal's opinion. Alternatively, the Sidereal could find a loud, pompous senator with whom the Sidereal disagrees and use this same Charm on him. When the senator makes a speech in contrast to the Sidereal's opinion and the Sidereal's player succeeds on a Presence roll, the senator's abusive rhetoric and caustic sense of humor put his colleagues in a mood to oppose him... if only out of spite.
   A victim can be under the effect of only one application of this Charm at a time.</description>

            <description>With a touch and an undetectable whisper to the universe, the Sidereal tugs at the fate surrounding a person and lends it such a resonant destiny that others are compelled to fulfill the imposed doom. This Charm "hangs" a social attack from the Sidereal on a target that must be inside fate, though the social attack validly targets creatures outside of fate. The attack may impose any influence the Exalt can manage normally, compelling behavior or encouraging a belief, but it must do so with a central focus on the presence and actions of the target of the Charm. The weight of their destiny imposes the Sidereal's vision on others.
   The social attack triggers and is applied against valid targets, which may include the person on which it hangs, under a set of circumstances decided by the Sidereal when the Charm is activated. This may be as simple as a time delay, or as complex as being present for a meeting between two specific characters. The Charm lapses without effect at the end of the story. No more than one use of this Charm may be in effect on the same target at the same time.</description>

        <description>As the Sidereal touches her target's forehead to bless him, a ghostly image of the Sidereal's caste mark appears on the target's left palm. The player then rolls (Charisma + Presence) against the victim's Dodge Mental Defense Value, and adds her Essence in automatic successes. If this roll succeeds, the victim gains the Sidereal's Motivation in addition to his own. Both are equally strong and are equally valid for the purposes of social combat and regaining Willpower. This state of dual Motivation lasts for as long as the Sidereal keeps the Essence committed. The victim can spend a point of Willpower to ignore the urges of the Sidereal's Motivation in favor of the victim's own for one day, during which time the Sidereal's Motivation is no longer valid for social combat or regaining Willpower. If the victim pushes the Sidereal's Motivation aside a number of times equal to the Sidereal's Essence, the Charm's effect (and the Essence commitment) ends.</description>

            <description>By fortunate happenstance, the interests of an attacker and one of the Sidereal's friends coincide, distracting both from the import of the Exalt herself. So sequestered, she is forgotten and unmolested. This Charm may be activated in response to a social attack, but only so long as another valid target that possesses a positive Intimacy or favorable Motivation regarding the Sidereal is within (Essence) yards. Circumstances conspire to make them the target of the social attack in lieu of the Exalt. If the attack is Performance-based, the replacement target's MDV is halved against the attack, as their distracted attention-splitting leaves them more vulnerable even as they prevent the Sidereal from considering and becoming susceptible to the influence.
   Sidereals with keen social instincts understand that, though they will give up on their servitude if ill-treated, the limits of a true friend are great indeed. With a Presence 5+ repurchase, a Sidereal may use this Charm to redirect physical attacks and other undesired effects (such as the random mutation of the Wyld or the roaring flames of a bonfire) toward a Familiar or Acquaintance. Each redirected effect counts as a scene eroding any Intimacies of loyalty or friendship that the companion may have for the Exalt. Once all such Intimacies are gone, the companion will tend to resent the Sidereal and may leave or even attack him, but until then they suffer their impressed guardianship without complaint.</description>

        <description>Creation supports the decisions of the Viziers, and punishes those who defy the Viziers. A Vizier may use this Charm any time she (or an individual who serves as her proxy) faces another person in a conflict where choices must be made. The two may be opposing generals on a battlefield, haggling merchants, diplomats negotiating a treaty or any other circumstance in which two people confront each other but at least agree on the nature of the confrontation.
   The Sidereal channels Essence into a prayer strip of the Scripture of the Drowning Maiden and fixes the strip in the middle of his shadow, where the prayer strip glows a brilliant scarlet. The Vizier names a single possible - if improbable - circumstance that could prove ruinous to her opponent and advantageous to her own side. For instance, a merchant could suffer a bandit attack on his caravan, leaving him with nothing to sell; the Sidereal general's reinforcements could ride over the hill; the opposing diplomat's nation might suffer unexpected treachery from an ally. The Sidereal cannot ask for the impossible, such as tyrant lizards raining from the sky into the enemy's capital, and she can't ask for any intervention that reaches beyond Creation. The proposed event must be proportional to the target's scale: no burning down the city because a shopkeeper won't give you a discount. Finally, the target must be within 10 miles.
   The Sidereal's player rolls (Intelligence + Presence) at a difficulty of the sum of the Magnitude of whatever social unit or dominion he represents, and either his own Essence or the highest Essence of any member of the group he represents. (A shopkeeper might represent no one but a few employees; a diplomat could represent a nation, or even a coalition such as the Confederation of Rivers).
   If this roll succeeds, the Tapestry of Creation itself quivers in excitement and the targeted person intuitively knows that he faces a choice. Either the Sidereal's requested event happens as she wants it to, or the pent-up tension in the Tapestry discharges through the character himself. This discharge inflicts dice of aggravated damage equal to the Sidereal's Essence, plus one die per extra success on the roll. The damage ignores armor. If the target character tries to defend himself with defensive Charms, he takes no damage but the Sidereal's condition comes to pass automatically.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Drowning Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...falling forever in the water. She reached for purchase, but found nothing; her arms swung through the sea.
   The water did not slow her, nor did the chill,
   But she could not breathe.
   Each time she gasped and found no breath, a human child died; and thus, she lived.
   "Survival is acceptance", she said.</comment>

            <description>The portentous nature of the Sidereal Exalted impresses itself upon the world as the nature of any Exalt might overwhelm a person. They supplant the circumstance and desire of all of Creation with their plans. An Exalt using this Charm affixes a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Drowning Maiden in his shadow, wrestling the world into the desired shape and pinning it there with a knotted sutra. As he does so, he decrees to the world what it must do, a circumstance or occurrence that must take place within the current scene, and it will happen in the most plausible way possible.
   This is a far-reaching Charm, and potentially very strange. It narratively creates new resources for the Sidereal, but these are things that have always existed in the world. Wealth arrives by way of a lost Guild caravan. During a pitched battle in the wilderness, "reinforcements" arrive in the form of a native horde that hates one side more than the other. Evidence of a crime is covered up by a sudden house fire. This Charm creates and sets scenes, and even introduces new characters. This means that it is often Shaping, but it may instead act as a Compulsion on the animals and people nearby who could fulfill the needs of the Sidereal's vision.
   Generally, phenomena and obstacles conjured by this Charm should have values for Damage, Trauma, difficulties, external penalties, or most other values that are no higher than (Exalt's Essence). Obstacles might have soak values double that. When the Sidereal's desired destiny requires characters, the closest, relevant and most likely to be susceptible candidates have their MDV compared to the Exalt's (Manipulation + Presence). If their MDV is lower, the candidates are subject to an unnatural Compulsion to fulfill the destiny, unless they spend 4wp to ignore it. Characters with higher MDVs, or who reject the influence before they fulfill the destiny, cause this Charm to search for the next best candidates, but no more than once during each of the Sidereal’s actions.</description>

Each health level gained thus helps a Sidereal operate at maximum efficiency in spite of his wounds for just a little bit longer.

        <description>The Sidereal buys protection from one element through a sacrifice of pain to one of that element's gods. Despite the name, a Seer can gain protection from any one element at a time, not just water or fire. To activate this Charm, the Sidereal must touch a sample of the chosen element, such as a hearth-fire, a bucket of water, a tree, the ground or a passing breeze. As long as the character keeps Essence committed to the Charm, that element cannot harm her. Water cannot drown, freeze or boil her; fire cannot burn her, nor desert heat give her sunstroke; plants do not hinder her, poison her or tear her flesh with their thorns; and so on.</description>

            <errText>This Charm may be activated multiple times, each time to protect against a different element. Each activation protects against one of the five cardinal elements: Air, Earth, Fire, Water or Wood. The aggregate effect of the Charm is to provide comprehensive protection against environmental hazards of all kinds, as long as they are not attacks from characters.
   Each activation after the first halves its mote cost, to a minimum of 1m. Motes are committed in aggregate and released based on the number of activations, not in the order in which the Charm's uses were paid for.
   With a drop of blood and an act of will, powerful Sidereals may extend the protection of Water and Fire Treaty against the environmental attacks of characters. Viziers with Essence 4+ may make a special activation of this Charm, altering its health level cost to be lethal, to apply the Charm's effects against such attacks for the rest of the scene. They need not sample an element to activate Water and Fire Treaty this way.</errText>

        <description>By sacrificing a bit of her flesh and Essence, a Vizier can bind an elemental to protect a location and its people, potentially for almost a year. The Sidereal needs a powerful manifestation of the chosen element, such as a burning house, a rushing stream, a gale, the depths of a cave or an old-growth forest. The Sidereal's player rolls (Charisma + Resistance) with a difficulty equal to the sum of the Essence of the elemental he wants to bind and the Magnitude of the dominion he wants protected (as defined in the Mandate of Heaven system; see the Exalted Storyteller's Companion). Sidereals have a +2 bonus when dealing with spirits of the element associated with their Maiden, and this does not count toward dice gained from Charms.</description>

            <description>Sacrifice in Creation is a trade of pain and love. Should the Sidereal invoke Water and Fire Treaty by touching a living elemental, the spirit is spurred to become a guardian of something the Exalt holds dear. The Exalt rolls (Charisma + Resistance) against the target's Dodge MDV, and if successful binds them per the spell Summon Elemental (Exalted, p. 254), except that the Sidereal can only bind the elemental to protect the subject of one of the Exalt's Intimacies. The chosen subject must be a discrete thing, including an object, a group of objects, a structure, a character, or a social group. Exalts using this Charm to bind elementals of the kind associated with their Maiden and Caste gain two automatic successes on their social attack roll.</description>

        <description>When the Sidereal is exposed to a drug or poison, intentionally or unawares, she can lock it away as a memorandum attached to her fate and pass that memorandum off on someone else. At the drug or poison's first damage interval (see Exalted, p. 130), the Sidereal can reflexively activate this Charm instead of trying to resist the poison. Her player rolls (Stamina + Resistance). If the roll succeeds, the effect of the substance separates entirely from the Sidereal's fate but remains in orbit around it. The substance remains suspended thus until the next time the Sidereal successfully attacks someone in close combat and her player rolls at least one die of lethal or aggravated damage. Whether the damage roll succeeds or not, the orbiting memorandum transfers to the victim of the attack, whereupon the substance's effects kick in immediately as if the victim had originally ingested the poison or drug himself.
   The Sidereal can contain only one deleterious substance at a time: using this Charm twice results in the first toxin's effect returning to the Sidereal. The transfer of a poison is automatic, beyond the Sidereal's control.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal snares his opponents' fates in combat and uses them to safeguard his own. If an attack should damage the Sidereal while he is thus defended, that damage transfers to one of the opponents whose fate the Sidereal has ensnared.
   The Sidereal's player may activate this Charm after damage for a successful attack is rolled, but before it is applied. The player rolls (Dexterity + Resistance). For every two successes this roll garners - up to a maximum equal to the levels of damage the attack actually inflicted - the player subtracts one health level from the damage the Sidereal should take and inflicts it instead on his attacker or one of his attacker's present allies. This transferred damage cannot be dodged, parried or soaked except by powers that let a character dodge even undodgeable attacks, parry unblockable attacks or prevent all damage from attacks. If the target does so, neither the Sidereal nor the target suffers the damage. The Sidereal can transfer damage to only one target per attack. He transfers bashing damage as bashing damage, and lethal or aggravated damage as lethal damage.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal reaches out to grasp the fate of an attack headed her way, carrying it off like a banner to bestow upon someone else. Calling upon the Shield of Destiny, the Sidereal rolls (Dexterity + Resistance) in Step 7 of an attack against her. Every success on this activation roll subtracts a single die from the post-soak damage of the attack (to a minimum of one die remaining).
   Damage prevented by this Charm remains caught in the weave of the Sidereal's destiny, vibrating like a trapped fly. Whenever the Sidereal is attacked, she may release this thrumming tension as an unblockable and undodgeable counterattack that hits automatically in Step 9. The counterattack has damage equal to the amount of dice initially negated by Shield of Destiny, and bypasses both soak and Hardness.
   A Sidereal may maintain up to (Essence) activations of this Charm. She may release these without making a counterattack if she wishes to, dissipating the tangle of violence throughout the whole of the Loom of Fate.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal catches the destinies of weapons or other sources of damage in a net of Essence. This Charm raises her bashing, lethal and aggravated soak by an amount equal to her Essence. In addition, opponents whose Essence is lower than the Sidereal's Compassion must spend one Willpower point any time they take an action intended to damage or disable her. (This expenditure must be separate from Willpower spent for bonus successes or to channel Virtues). If an opponent does not do so, the action fails automatically.
   The Sidereal cannot benefit from this Charm while she is wearing armor.</description>

            <description>Postponing her sacrifice so that she might continue to serve Creation, the Sidereal flicks her thumb across the strand of her lifespan, deferring all efforts to cut it. Optimistic Security Practice adds (Essence) to the Sidereal's bashing, lethal, and aggravated soak. If she is not wearing any armor, this rises to her (Essence + Resistance).
   In addition, the Sidereal winds the destiny of (her Compassion - target's Compassion, minimum one) of each of her opponents' positive Intimacies around her own. When attacked, the Sidereal may interpose the likeness of one of the target's Intimacies over her own like a spectral hostage, its eyes pained by shock and incomprehension at the target's betrayal. The target must pay one Willpower to attack the Sidereal through the figure of his Intimacy; failing to do so causes the attack to sever the thread of that Intimacy, discarding it from the attacker's Intimacies completely. The Sidereal gains the benefit of this defense against any opponent who attacks her until each of that opponent's captured Intimacies have been destroyed, or until the opponent has spent (Sidereal's Compassion) Willpower to resist. The Sidereal may not capture more than five Intimacies of any target per scene, and if two Sidereals capture the same Intimacy, the defense is no longer applicable once that Intimacy has been severed. This Charm does not allow the Sidereal a survey of the target's Intimacies; which Intimacies are captured are determined by the Storyteller, but the Charm generally snares those Intimacies the target considers most important first.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal enfolds her heart in a pocket of emptiness that separates her heart from Creation. When she does so, she dispenses with the need to breathe, eat or drink, as well as her normal susceptibility to disease, poison, degenerative effects, temperature extremes or exposure. While her heart remains hidden, she suffers no penalties resulting from adverse environmental conditions or impairments to normal body function. Fatigue penalties (from exertion or armor) no longer bother her. She cannot be knocked unconscious. She still suffers damage as normal, but does not take wound penalties. Even if damage ought to Incapacitate her, she functions as if nothing is wrong. Seeing foes hacking away at her with axes or perforating her with frog-crotch arrows might convince her that a tactical retreat is wise, but if her determination overrides her better judgment, she can stay in the fight until she drops dead.
   Until the Sidereal restores her heart to its place, she cannot regain Essence except through Charms. When she does restore her heart, any poisons, diseases, fatigue penalties, deprivation penalties, environmental conditions (if she's in the same environment) or wounds she accrued while her heart was away kick in all at once as if she were first exposed to them the moment the Charm's duration ended.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip that bears the Scripture of the Eternal Maiden. As he infuses the prayer strip with Essence, the prayer strip hovers beside him. The air immediately around the character darkens, but the prayer strip glows with bright yellow light.
   When any effect inflicts harm on the Sidereal, the Sidereal can reflexively grab the destinies of as many visible targets as he chooses (one per three motes he spends against an attack) and tangle them with his own. This reflexive entanglement occurs in Step 8 of attack resolution after damage or deleterious effects have been rolled, but before they have been applied. With their destinies wound together thus, all of the chosen targets suffer the same damage or other effects the attack inflicted on the Sidereal. Powers that let a character dodge even undodgeable attacks, parry unblockable attacks or prevent all damage from attacks protect against this damage transference.
   Although the Charm itself lasts for the scene, the character must entangle his targets' destinies anew (and spend the motes to do so) with each new damage effect that affects him.</description>

Thereafter, attacks targeting the Sidereal are treated as simultaneously targeting the Exalt's chosen victims normally, even if the attack cannot usually strike more than one target.

        <description>The Sidereal evokes a luminous bridle of golden stardust. Fitting the bridle to a chosen mount or animal companion ties that animal's destiny together with the Sidereal's. The bridle automatically sizes and shapes itself to fit the animal in question, then fades away.
   That animal becomes a new familiar for the Vizier. If the Sidereal has no appropriate animal at hand, he can ask Mercury to lead him to a worthy specimen of a species he designates. The character gains an innate sense of the direction to an appropriate animal. The bridle remains solid and whole until he reaches his new familiar. The chosen animal allows him to approach and place the bridle upon it, already feeling the gravity of fate pulling its simple soul. If the Sidereal selects his own animal, the Charm costs an additional Willpower point.
   The animal remains a familiar, with appropriate benefits to the Sidereal, for the rest of the story. Whether the animal stays a familiar afterward depends on how the character treated the animal. If the player wants to spend experience points on the Background, the character can certainly keep the animal as a familiar (see "Backgrounds Gained Through Charms", p. 126).</description>

        <description>When a Sidereal uses this Charm on a beloved - or, at least, long-suffering - familiar, she transforms that animal into a small god whose only duty is to serve that character. Should the Sidereal release the familiar from her service or die in the line of duty, though, the Celestial Bureaucracy might assign the small god to some other duty.
   An uplifted familiar adds one dot to its Background rating. The familiar gains new scores of Essence 2 and minima of Compassion 2, Conviction 3, Temperance 1 and Valor 2. The familiar's Intelligence also increases to 2 (if it was lower) and becomes more humanlike in order to facilitate communication. The familiar's health levels rise to a number at least equal to its (Willpower + Conviction), adding equal numbers of -1 and -2 health levels to make up any shortfall. The former animal's Essence pool equals (Essence x 10) + (Willpower x 5). Just as any familiar, if the small god's Background rating is three dots or higher, the familiar has an additional pool of five motes that only its master can use.
   As a spirit, the familiar's natural state is now dematerialized. The familiar no longer needs to eat or drink as a normal animal (though the habits remain). The familiar automatically learns the Materialize Charm (see Exalted, p. 295), but can manifest itself visually for only a single mote of Essence. A divine familiar worth three or more dots also learns one additional universal spirit Charm of the Storyteller's choosing. Finally, the familiar gains the ability to assume an alternative appearance that blends humanoid characteristics with the creature's own animal form. Changing from one form to another is a miscellaneous action with no cost or dice roll.
   A Sidereal can use this Charm only on his own familiars.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Eternal Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...made from a lump of iron, shaped by wind, sea and fire.
   Fearing how wood might shape her,She ran, and did not look back.
   One day, she forgot what she ran from.
   So, she pulled out her heart to ask it.
   "Why don't you look back and see?" it said.
   So, she sighed and threw her heart away.
   "I have no use for beginnings", said she.</comment>

        <description>A Sidereal can promote his uplifted small god familiar. The small god's Essence and Intelligence increase to a minimum of 3 (if either was lower). The small god can transport itself and at least one other creature between Yu-Shan and Creation. The small god also gains four additional points of Virtues, distributed as the Storyteller chooses; two additional spirit Charms, also of the Storyteller's choosing; and an additional alternative appearance. The small god's Background rating rises by one dot.
   The familiar also gains new responsibilities. It must safely escort the character the familiar serves to and from Yu-Shan as necessary. (The Celestial Bureaucracy also holds the small god responsible for the character's conduct in Heaven). The small god must travel regularly between Creation and Heaven to carry messages to or from the Sidereal the familiar serves. Finally, the familiar must file regular reports on the character's activities. A harried, many-limbed spirit named Jagoth, who was once just an uplifted familiar spirit himself, receives the reports at the Bureau of Destiny's mailroom. Jagoth's "IN" box is an architectural marvel often mistaken for a library shelf. His "OUT" box is dusty.
   A Sidereal can use this Charm only on a familiar he has previously uplifted with Spirit-Shape Companion.</description>

        </prerequest>
        <description>This Charm works just as Ordained Bridle of Mercury does, but this Charm affects people. The Sidereal chooses a person - or has the Maiden of Journeys choose one of a preferred occupation and personality for him - and receives Mercury's bridle in a shape that fits a human head. When a chosen mortal sees the bit, he calmly allows the Sidereal to fit it to him, at which point the bridle and the memory of accepting it fade away. If the Sidereal selects a mortal, the Charm costs an additional Willpower point.
   The Sidereal gains one dot of the Acquaintances Background. Uses after the first against the same mortal either intensify the bond between the mortal and the Sidereal or expand the familiarity effect among an increasing number of the mortal's own acquaintances. For example, one use of this power enables a single mortal to recognize the Sidereal as a friendly stranger the mortal's seen around before. The next use might rope the mortal's close friends into the effect as well. With the third use, not only the original mortal and his close friends recognize the Sidereal, but all the regulars at the gambling house where the mortal and his pals hang out do as well. In order for the Sidereal to expand her network of acquaintances in this way with this Charm, she must use it repeatedly on the same mortal. (See pp. 102-103 for details about the Acquaintances Background).
   As with Ordained Bridle of Mercury, the new acquaintances last only through a single story, unless the player spends experience points or the character makes a special effort to secure their friendship. Likewise, a Sidereal can use this Charm on (i.e., apply the actual bridle itself to) a maximum number of people equal to her permanent Essence.</description>

For one success, the Maiden shows the Seer a path that enables him to reach his destination in three-quarters of the time it would normally take him based on travel type and distance. (See the chart on p. 264 of Exalted). If the character points out that he has a deadline to keep (and the player rolls three successes), Mercury illuminates any means that might exist to get the character there under normal travel conditions. (The character might have to run for three hours straight, bribe a courier in an elaborate horse relay system to give up his mount, gallop all the way to the coast and finally board a hard-rowing ocean vessel, but he'll make his appointment). If the player rolls five successes and the character has a deadline to beat, the Maiden of Journeys reveals to him a miraculous path that will get the Seer to his destination ahead of his deadline no matter how far away it is and how little time remains.</description>

            <errText>The deadlines a character rushes to meet with the assistance of this Charm must actually exist. She cannot arbitrarily invent or declare deadlines for herself. For example, a Vizier might hurry across Creation to reach Nexus in time for her brother's birthday if she intends to pay him a surprise visit upon arriving, but could not do so simply because she wishes to use the Nexus gateway to get back to Yu-Shan as soon as possible.
   The paths revealed by this Charm aren't guaranteed to be free of danger to the Sidereal, but will not lead her into certain doom. Miraculous paths revealed by rolling 5+ successes allow the Sidereal to bypass limitations of distance, but not of active obstruction; for example, an attempt to divine a path to the heart of the Imperial Manse would quickly deposit a Sidereal at the entrance to the structure, at which point it would be up to her to find some way to breach its formidable defenses.</errText>

        <description>The player spends his motes and rolls (Charisma + Ride). If the roll succeeds, the character's mount radiates a nimbus of faint yellow light for the next five minutes. During that time, every success on the activation roll adds five yards to the mount's base Move distance. Also, the animal can gallop through, up or over natural obstacles such as dense forests, crowds, cliffs, open water or even gaping chasms as easily as it can move across flat, open terrain. Unnatural obstacles, such as human-made walls or sorcerous barricades, still impede progress as normal.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Desirable Maiden. He affixes the prayer strip to the forehead of one of his familiars or acquaintances (per the Backgrounds). During the next five miscellaneous actions, the person or animal blazes with golden starlight while it meta-morphoses into the shape of a lesser elemental dragon of either air or water, with the scripture written on its back. This process is not gentle or pleasant, so the victim must be restrained until the transformation is complete. Otherwise, the victim can tear the strip from his forehead as a diceless miscellaneous action. (An unrestrained witness to the transformation can do so as well). If the prayer strip comes off before the change is finished, the victim returns to normal, decreasing the value of the Sidereal's applicable Familiar or Acquaintances Background by one dot.
   The dragon serves as the Vizier's steed and fights for her. It has a Control rating of 2 (see Exalted, p. 154) - it actively wants to carry the rider. If anyone somehow tries to ride the dragon without the Sidereal's consent, however, the dragon has a Control rating of 5.
   When the Charm's duration elapses, the dragon changes back into the person, animal or minor god it once was. No longer is that being a familiar or acquaintance. Instead, the creature is a burned-out husk of its former self, forever lost in dreams of its all-too-brief glory. The creature's Intelligence drops to zero thereafter, and it cannot care for itself; without constant invalid care, the creature will die. The only alternative is for the Sidereal to sacrifice a dot of permanent Willpower - giving part of her soul and Exaltation so her victim can become a true elemental dragon, albeit with an Essence of only 4. In time, it may grow even greater. The dragon no longer serves the Sidereal, but may become an ally through the course of play (or if the player spends the requisite experience points for a three-dot Ally).</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Desirable Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...whom many men wanted for their own.
   She stepped as softly as starlight.
   She shone with glory.
   And one by one, they came to claim her.
   She fled by the quickest route she found.
   "Why do you run?" the storm clouds said.
   She said, "I cannot help who drives me".</comment>

        <description>When the Viziers must travel, destiny helps them along. The character may use this Charm at any port. Within a day, the character absolutely definitely finds a vessel about to leave for her destination and willing to take her aboard. The ship's captain might not intend to go exactly where the Sidereal intends... but the Sidereal knows the ship will end up there anyway. Viziers should keep in mind that some destinations carry intrinsic dangers: the only way to reach Bluehaven, for instance, is to board a vessel destined for capture by the Lintha pirates. The Charm arranges transportation; safety is the Sidereal's own problem.
   This Charm's effects extend beyond ships that sail rivers and seas. A Sidereal can find equally fortuitous transport on the sand-ships of the Southern deserts, caravans, stagecoaches or any other form of group conveyance. This Charm does not help with personal transport such as riding beasts, and will not work in locations where vehicles do not regularly arrive and depart.</description>

        <description>When the Sidereal uses this charm, he exhales a long, silent breath that slips between the threads of the Tapestry of Creation and clears a space around the strand that represents the ship on which he sails. For the next scene, the ship sails smoothly regardless of fierce weather or high waves, moving as effortlessly as a toy ship across a map.
   As a result, environmental penalties no longer affect the pilot's Sail rolls, and the ship takes no further damage from the harsh conditions for the rest of the scene.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal glares or points imperiously at a troublesome water elemental, river god or similar spirit, radiating all the authority of the Maiden of Journeys. A yellow aura surrounds the targeted spirit, and it suddenly remembers something important to do elsewhere. Perhaps the spirit neglected to deliver a delinquent report to its superior. Perhaps an offering awaits the spirit at a shrine downstream. Perhaps Mercury needs to speak to the spirit personally about a pressing matter. This understanding is not false. A legitimate reason to be someplace else does occur to the troublesome spirit, though the Sidereal doesn't know what the reason is.
   When this understanding comes upon the spirit, it must act on the understanding. If the spirit wants to do anything other than set out immediately, the spirit must spend a Willpower point to resist the Compulsion to go elsewhere right away.</description>

   Even when the truculent spirit resists the Compulsion, the world itself dooms them for shirking their duties elsewhere. Other characters reduce by one the target number of actions they take that would drive the spirit away, including physical attacks and social attacks to convince the target to leave.</description>
            <errText>This Charm only affects spirits strongly associated with water, be they gods, demons, or even ghosts whose death involved drowning or being killed at sea. The target must be within (Essence x 10) yards. Use of the Charm acts as a social attack, the Sidereal rolling ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Sail) against the target's MDV. It costs 3wp to ignore this unnatural Compulsion for the rest of the scene. Each time the Sidereal's anima flares to a new level, the spirit must resist again as if the attack had succeeded with 0 extra successes.</errText>

        <description>A ship is a tiny refuge of human order in the vast, inhuman sea. By tracing the burning yellow Sign of Journeys on a ship's prow, a Sidereal protects the ship and its passengers against supernatural forces. One version of the Charm protects the ship from gods and elementals, another from the Fair Folk and the Wyld, a third from the dead and forces of the Underworld and a fourth from demons and forces of Malfeas. A character starts with one form of the Charm, and may buy additional forms of protection for two experience points or one bonus point each. A vessel can carry only one form of protection at a time, though.
   A banned entity cannot touch or board the ship unless the entity's Essence exceeds the Sidereal's. The Sidereal's Essence is also added to any dice pool or single value needed for the ship or passengers to resist a banned entity or environment, such as the roll to resist Wyld mutation, the dice pool to calculate Defense Value against a demon's claws, or another character's Essence to resist the Malediction power of the Storm Mother Sikunare.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal commits the required motes and casts a handful of salt over the edge of her vessel. The whiteness of the salt spreads out in all directions. In a blink, the Sidereal finds her vessel and crew bobbing on a solid field of white that shifts between miniature whitecaps, miniature sand dunes, loose flower petals or palm-sized paper snowflakes. From any witness' points of view, the vessel seems to vanish.
   The sea of white is a particular view of a dematerialized stratum of reality. From Creation, the ship looks like a faint transparent silhouette moving in a gust of wind. (Awareness rolls to notice the vessel or any rolls to track it suffer a two-dice external penalty). While the ship moves thus, it travels at twice its normal pace, unimpeded by obstacles or weather conditions. The ship can even travel over dry land. Dematerialized entities can see the ship clearly. Charms and spells that enable one to see or affect dematerialized entities can also reveal or affect the ship.
   No one aboard the ship, however, can see the surroundings of Creation through which the ship moves. Plotting a course that takes the use of this Charm into account, or setting a different course for a new destination once this Charm is in effect, requires a successful (Intelligence + Sail) roll at difficulty 3. Once this Charm is invoked, though, maintaining a heading in the plain of white is as simple as lashing the wheel in place.
   The journey ends when the Sidereal ends the com-mitment of motes at the journey's planned end, at the end of five days or if the Sidereal dies or falls off the vessel. In these cases, the vessel reappears fully in Creation. This can be awkward, if the ship was sailing over land at the time. If anyone falls off the ship, he reappears in Creation and cannot board again. (If the Charm ends because the Sidereal falls overboard, however, the Sidereal also reappears in Creation, next to the vessel).
   As an alternative to cross-Creation travel, a Sidereal can use this Charm to sail a ship from Creation to Yu-Shan or back. The trip takes exactly five days from the moment the Sidereal sets course for Heaven. The Celestial port authorities do not like Sidereals arriving unannounced with a shipload of goggle-eyed mortals, unruly Solars or what-have-you, and will surely file a request for censure at the Bureau of Destiny.
   Travel to other locations, such as Malfeas or the darkling seas of the Underworld, may also be possible; if so, the Bureau of Destiny keeps these navigational courses strictly secret. Assuming these alternate courses are possible, each additional otherworldly destination costs two experience points (or one bonus point). The journey between worlds always takes five days.
   A Sidereal can also use this Charm personally, just by throwing salt into any body of water (a mud puddle will do) and jumping in. However, this incurs the additional cost of one Willpower point. From then on, the character is swimming in the sea of white until she lets the Charm lapse. See Exalted, p. 130, for the effects of prolonged, strenuous activity. However, the character does swim twice as fast as normal.
   Note: The Fate keyword applies to passengers aboard a vessel when the Sidereal uses this Charm. The ship and its crew disappear as normal, but beings outside fate are left behind in Creation.</description>

            <errText>The difficulty of plotting or changing course with this Charm is two higher than normally doing so. Normally invalid rolls, such as plotting a course over dry land with a sailing vessel, are allowed, and are difficulty 5.
   Learning the courses to other worlds does not cost experience or bonus points, but does require extensive familiarity with the more usual methods of traveling to the other realm of existence, to the point that no knowledge recall rolls would be necessary to know them. The difficulty of plotting courses to other realms is never less than 6.</errText>

        <description>In their travels, sometimes the Seers of Heaven encounter problems that make further progress seem impossible. In such cases, a Sidereal can channel Essence into a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Maiden at Sea. He casts the strip into the air, where the prayer strip explodes in a flash of golden lightning.
   Before the scene ends, something happens to remove the obstacle to his travel: a sudden squall blows away the approaching pirates, the desert caravan that has run out of water finds an oasis, a secret tunnel offers a way into the fortress, giant birds nest on the island where he is stranded. But the Sidereal (and any companions) have only traded one trouble for another, equally severe but possibly soluble: the squall also blows the Sidereal's ship aground in a dangerous land, the oasis has a Fair Folk mistress who transforms men into beasts, the secret passage is prone to dangerous rock falls, catching a ride on a giant bird takes the Sidereal to a valley of the giant snakes the birds feed upon. This new threat is locked into destiny, so a Seer cannot use Five Ordeals Odyssey again to attempt another escape and perhaps some lesser danger. The Charm also cannot remove impediments to travel that come from outside fate, such as attacking nephwracks or storms of Wyld energy.
   The Charm obviously demands some skill at improvisation from the Storyteller. Whenever a character with this Charm takes a journey, it helps to prepare one or two scenes of replacement perils that can be plugged into the story at any point.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Maiden at Sea
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who set sail with a captain she did not know.
   She noticed the ship was crushing the waves and told the Captain to steer the ship higher so that it could be above them. "But not too high", she said. "I'd hate to crush the clouds".
   The sea came over the side as a creature with teeth. So, she set it on fire, until only the teeth were left. It wasn't expecting that to happen.
   A face in the depths glared at the Captain. The maiden got angry.
   She broke the face and broke the depths and broke the sea, leaving only the white caps of the waves. "Why did you do that?" asked the face.
   "Rarely is travel peaceful", the maiden said.</comment>

        <description>An office of the Bureau of Destiny holds a list of every person in a generation who is destined to fall in love. A spurned, vindictive or simply overprotective Sidereal can remove a person's name from this roster for as long as the Sidereal commits Essence to this Charm. When he does so, the victim's Appearance drops to 1 before the application of any supernatural effects. For the victim to apply such effects, he must pay the standard cost of the effect, and then his player must spend a Willpower point and succeed at a (Manipulation + Socialize) roll with a difficulty of the Sidereal's Essence.
   If a person with romantic feelings toward the victim has a permanent Essence score lower than the Sidereal's, that person's romantic feelings cease immediately. Intimacies related to those romantic feelings also disappear. Neither the feelings nor the Intimacies may be re-established until the Charm ends. A player whose character's Motivation centers on love for the Charm's victim must immediately choose a new Motivation. This does not cost experience points. If the player wants to resume the old Motivation once the Charm ends, however, this does incur the normal cost of two experience points.</description>

            <description>Love is like an Ending, no more keenly felt than when it is gone. This Charm strikes a target's name from the rolls of love. Characters with romantic Intimacies for the target treat scenes interacting with him as a scene eroding those Intimacies, regardless of the context. Paying one Willpower allows one to ignore this unnatural Emotion effect for the scene. Characters must likewise resist this Emotion effect when trying to build an Intimacy of love for the target.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal chooses two people - a beneficiary and a victim - and twists their fates to grant the beneficiary an emotional dominion over the victim. The victim might fear the beneficiary, desire her sexually, revere her or otherwise define himself in terms of her. (The Sidereal can name herself the beneficiary in such a relationship). Regardless, the victim cannot resist succumbing to the beneficiary's will.
   To activate this Charm, the Sidereal's player rolls (Manipulation + Socialize) against the victim's Dodge Mental Defense Value, and adds the character's Essence in automatic successes. If the roll succeeds, the victim immediately views the beneficiary in terms the Sidereal defines. To overcome this effect for a scene in the beneficiary's presence, the victim must spend one Willpower point. When he has spent a number of Willpower points equal to the activation roll's threshold, the victim no longer suffers the effect of the Charm.</description>

        <description>If a character commits a social faux pas or otherwise violates some cultural taboo, a Sidereal can use this Charm to mitigate the social backlash. She can do so either for herself, or on someone else's behalf. Activating the Charm requires a successful (Manipulation + Socialize) roll. With one success, people no longer care about the social infraction. With three successes, not only do people refuse to hold the infraction against the person who committed it, but they either consider the behavior acceptable under the circumstances or hail the violator as a charming rogue. With five or more successes, acceptance of the behavior becomes part of the community's Policy for the rest of the story. Later, people regain their senses.
   This Charm won't necessarily save the perpetrator from the legal repercussions of breaking laws, only from the way other people might regard him. This Charm permits a special form of dodging in social combat: when the character comes under social attack, she says something outrageously offensive about her attacker, and activates this Charm. With one success, she distracts onlookers from the social attack and doesn't have to answer her attacker's argument. With three, she pulls the sympathy of any onlookers to her side.</description>

        <description>Using this Charm, a Vizier can make other people want to please him; actually harming him seems unthinkable. For the scene, anyone whose character wants to attack the Sidereal must succeed at a Conviction roll with a difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence. Knowingly acting in a way that will not please the Sidereal requires a successful Temperance roll at the same difficulty. What's more, any roll made for the Sidereal to seduce someone receives a number of bonus successes equal to the Sidereal's Essence.</description>

            <description>This Charm lays bare the lust that all must feel for Exalted heroes. Those that are friendly try to please the Sidereal, while those that are hostile turn to bitter rage that they cannot find it within themselves to please her. Characters that wish to attack the Sidereal must overcome their own desire for her, requiring a Conviction roll much like a Morale check (see Exalted, pp. 156-157), with a rating based on the apparent ability for the Exalt to fulfill the attacker's desires. The more willing or capable she may seem, or the more singular the means at her disposal, the higher the difficulty, to a maximum of difficulty 3. Likewise, outside of combat, characters must roll Temperance in a similar manner to perform actions that they believe would displease the Sidereal while they can see her or believe that she can see them.
   These rolls need be made no more than once per action, but failure prevents one from carrying out any contrary actions unless the transgressor spends 2wp to ignore this Charm's unnatural Emotion. After spending Willpower to resist twice, a character is immunized against this Charm for the rest of the scene.</description>

        <description>The subtle Viziers find social groups to influence that no one else knew existed... including the social group itself. This Charm weaves strands of fate to draw together people who may not have known each other before. As they meet and discover common interests, they form a new social unit that can then become a target for social mass combat or manipulation.
   The Sidereal spends a full week in a wider community, meeting people and talking, spreading a net of ideas and fate. Her player rolls (Wits + Socialize) and spends the resulting successes either on the unit's Magnitude or on its Loyalty. Magnitude cannot exceed the Sidereal's Craft (Fate) score; Loyalty cannot exceed her highest Virtue. The Sidereal defines the Policy for the new social unit, but has no control over which individuals join. The Vizier can make herself the group's leader, but only through crafting a resplendent destiny for that purpose. Otherwise, the social unit operates on its own. If it survives, its Policy may evolve beyond what the Sidereal defined.
   Any conceivable common interest can become the basis of a social unit, and the group can have any goal the Sidereal wants. Improbable combinations, such as a garden club that wants to overthrow a despot, result in social units that probably do not last very long.</description>

            <errText>Magnitude and Loyalty are not built using rolled successes; Loyalty is determined normally, and the potential Magnitude of the group is simply equal to the rolled successes, subject to available membership. The Sidereal's roll determines the quality of the group and its leader. Ensnared members have competencies relevant to the group's Policy on a scale of none (one success) to expert (4+ ratings in Abilities; five or more successes). If the Exalt does not craft a destiny to become the leader, the leader is pulled from the pool of members, but may not have an unmodified Dodge MDV higher than the successes rolled to activate this Charm. Ignoring this unnatural Servitude call to duty costs a member 1wp per day, and the pull to join falls away after they resist (Sidereal's Essence) days.</errText>

        <description>In each hand, the Sidereal holds a prayer strip bearing the Scripture of the Whore. He infuses the strips with Essence and names a target for each strip. (These targets must both be within 10 miles of the Sidereal). The prayer strips disappear in flashes of blue flame (an Obvious event, but nothing about the Charm is Obvious to the targets). Each one then reappears wrapped around a bone in the named targets' bodies. The targets can't feel or see the embedded prayer strip unless the flesh over the strip is somehow removed. For as long as the Charm remains in effect, those particular bones become as difficult to damage as the prayer strips themselves (per the rules on destroying a prayer strip, on p. 125).
   When the Sidereal's player activates the Charm, he attempts two separate (Manipulation + Socialize) rolls - one against each target's Dodge Mental Defense Value, and adds his Essence in automatic successes each time. If he succeeds both times, he can then craft a new relationship (social and emotional) between the two targets. This relationship lasts for as long as the strips remain within the targets' bodies, even if the targets have never met each other before: fate inexorably pushes the two characters together into their new relationship. While the Sidereal's Essence remains committed, the targets experience a magically enforced Intimacy toward each other, and a target must spend a Willpower point to act significantly at odds with the relationship for a scene. If a character spends a number of Willpower points equal to the Sidereal's Essence on subsequent occasions to allow himself to act at odds with the relationship, the effect ends for that character. (Half of the committed Essence is no longer committed). The other targeted character remains under the effect, however.
   Surgery can dislodge a prayer strip, but doing so requires 12 successes on an extended (Dexterity + Medicine) action and inflicts one level of unsoakable lethal damage. If a strip is removed in this way, the Essence committed to the strip is no longer committed, but the other strip is not affected.
   Once the Charm ends, the targets still have the designated Intimacies toward each other, but they become normal Intimacies. Without the Illusion effect to reinforce the Intimacy, the two characters can lose the Intimacy by normal means, or keep it if they (and their players) so desire.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Whore
   Once there was a Maiden...
   ...and things didn't go so well for her.
   It was just the way of the world, you know?
   She had to give up power to get it, and she didn't get much.
   Some people hated her for getting any power at all.
   She needed a protector, so she gave herself to a man named Necessity.

            <errText>Activating this Charm is a five-minute ceremony wherein the Sidereal consecrates the relationship he is fabricating. He must have spent at least a scene interacting with both targets at some point in the current story, and he must have gauged their hearts by reading their motivations successfully (Exalted, p. 131). Applying the Charm’s effect requires only one roll that is applied against both targets.
   The targets may act against the imposed Intimacy without spending Willpower, but they suffer appropriate penalties. The difficulty of each roll during the surgery to remove a prayer strip is 6.</errText>

While the Charm is active, divide the number of motes spent by two for purposes of calculating the effect on the character's anima.

        <description>A Sidereal who uses this Charm can part the strands of the weave of fate, stepping between them and outside fate altogether. The character still physically exists in Creation, but her new condition makes her almost impossible to perceive. While the character remains outside fate, creatures whose Essence ratings do not exceed hers cannot detect her. If such creatures succeed on a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll, they might realize that some sort of presence has come among them, but affecting that presence or attacking it incurs a -2 external penalty on any related roll. Only characters with supernatural tracking abilities can attempt to track the hidden character.
   The character remains outside fate for as long as she commits the Essence to the Charm, but causing her anima banner to flare such that it causes Stealth Charms to fail also ends this effect. If two characters walk outside fate in the same location, they cannot automatically sense one another. Whether or not one sees or becomes aware of the other depends on the characters' relative Essence ratings.
   Walking Outside Fate carries the Fate keyword because other Charms with that keyword have diminished or nullified effects against characters using this Charm.</description>

        <description>A character can use this Charm only while he walks outside fate, per the prerequisite Charm. When he uses it, the Sidereal can whisper to someone and make the listener think the words come from her own mind. When the Sidereal speaks, the listener's player attempts a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence. If the roll fails, the listener assumes that the words are her own thoughts. If the roll succeeds, the words still whisper in her mind as her own voice, but she knows that the thoughts are not her own.
       Regardless of whether the target's roll succeeds, the Sidereal can still initiate social attacks against the target while using this Charm, and those attacks become unexpected. The Seer can even enhance those attacks with Charms based on other social Abilities. The Charm lasts for one social attack, or five minutes (five long ticks) if the Sidereal merely wants to talk to the target.</description>

        <description>The Sidereals can grant other people their own concealment from the world, as a blessing to assist them... or a curse. The Vizier must touch her target; the Vizier's player rolls (Dexterity + Stealth) at a difficulty of the target's Essence. Success means the target gains Arcane Fate of his own, with all the advantages and inconveniences that Sidereals know so well. On the other hand, he becomes immune to the Arcane Fates of others; the Sidereals' gift makes the target an honorary member of the Five-Score Fellowship while the Charm lasts. The target's Essence cannot exceed the Sidereal's own.
   The Gift of a Broken Mask lasts a day. After that, the Sidereal can extend the gift another day by spending another two motes, without the need to touch the target again. The Sidereal can also rescind the gift at any time.
   For double the initial and subsequent cost in Essence and Willpower, a Sidereal can extend the Gift of a Broken Mask to a social unit. He must lead the social unit (most likely through a resplendent destiny), or the social unit must be led by an ally or acquaintance (per the Background). The difficulty becomes the sum of the unit's Magnitude and the highest Essence of any member of the group, other than the Sidereal himself. As with a single target, no member's Essence score may exceed the Sidereal's own; the unit's Magnitude cannot exceed his Stealth. While the Seer continues the Charm, all activities of the social group as a whole are easily overlooked, and other people tend to ignore the unit's existence. In mass social combat, apply an internal penalty of -3 to the defender's side of the contested (Manipulation + Socialize) vs. (Wits + Awareness) roll to establish surprise and make unexpected social attacks.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal cloaks herself in the reflections of a thousand possible futures, making it almost impossible to focus on the "her" that exists in the present. The character is obviously present and real, perceptible by sight and touch, but determining any specific detail about her proves impossible. Where exactly she stands, what she wears, what she says, her appearance, even her gender.... None of these qualities makes an impression on an observer's mind.
   To activate this Charm, the player rolls (Manipulation + Stealth). If she scores at least one success, people who see the character cannot understand her words or describe her beyond vague generalities. Also, the effect imposes an external penalty equal to the activation successes on any roll made to affect, influence or notice the Sidereal.</description>

        <description>This Charm can temporarily transform the Sidereal into someone else entirely. To activate it, the Sidereal infuses Essence into a prayer strip of the Scripture of Absence. The prayer strip flashes dark green, then slithers beneath the Seer's ribcage to wrap around her heart. As the strip cinches tight, the Sidereal vanishes from her current location and reappears someplace else in a completely different identity that is seamlessly integrated into the local community. Any effect that was based on the Sidereal's old identity fails automatically. Memories of the Sidereal's old identity do not fade away - except as determined by the vagaries of Arcane Fate - but the person with that identity no longer seems to exist.
   In the instant when one identity vanishes, the Sidereal reflexively assumes a new one somewhere else in Creation. This identity can be mortal, Exalted, god, elemental, ghost or half-breed - any sentient creature from within fate's purview, whose Essence does not exceed the Seer's own. The Sidereal cannot take on the identity of someone who actually exists or existed. The Maidens (and the Storyteller) decide where the character appears, but the Vizier (and her player) can select an identity suitable to the new location - assuming her superiors in the Bureau of Destiny do not assign one.
   In her new identity, the character retains all of her Attributes and Abilities but gains up to 15 dots of Backgrounds appropriate to her new identity. (Backgrounds above three dots cost two dots each). Her old Backgrounds no longer apply. As the Vizier appears in her new location, a network of appropriate social contacts and relationships immediately weaves itself into being as if this new identity had existed among the locals all along. Only creatures of the Wyld, beings outside fate and spirits at or above the Maidens' level of power and authority are not fooled by this extemporaneously woven identity.
       Just as Attributes and Abilities, the character retains all of her Charms and spells, as well as her normal anima effects. If the character is known as an Exalt (of whatever type) among the locals, those witnesses understand the Sidereal's powers as being appropriate to an Exalt of the type they assume she is. If the character's supernatural powers, or all-too-human ignorance, should betray the fact that she doesn't belong, the character automatically receives a perfect success on a social roll to explain the matter in a way that makes perfect sense to the audience. ("Oh, she's not an Anathema. That's just a special Southern variant of the Air Dragon Style of the Immaculate martial arts she was apparently doing. I guess we don't have to get the Magistrate involved. Good thing she said something").
   If the Sidereal ends the Charm intentionally or spends more than 10 motes of peripheral Essence in a scene, the Charm ends. Its effects otherwise linger for five days, at which point the Sidereal coughs up the scraps of her prayer strip in a cloud of confetti and disappears from her false identity. She returns to her previous identity in the place that identity considers home.</description>

   Once, there were...
   ...shadows in the window.

   ...whispering at the door:

        <description>A Sidereal braids her own fate with that of the animal she can see and its totemic god. This Charm not only enables the character to communicate with a single animal and engage in normal social actions with it, but she can also bind it to serve her goals.
   Simple communication works automatically. If the successes on a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Survival) roll equal or exceed the animal's Control Rating (see Exalted, p. 154), the Vizier can impose an unnatural mental influence on the animal. The character can make an animal hostile or friendly to another creature, protect or shun a location or otherwise gain attitudes that would count as an Intimacy in a human being. Any suggestion that goes beyond an animal's normal understanding, however, becomes an unacceptable order. Later experience may break the magical Intimacy - for instance, if a "new friend" attacks the animal.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal interweaves her own fate with the networks of fate that bind a wilderness region to its gods, and thereby gain a measure of the gods' authority over local creatures. While this Charm is in effect, any wild beast with a Willpower less than or equal to the Sidereal's Compassion ignores the Exalt as either a potential predator or prey. He can lie down with the lions of the Southeastern savannas or march with the penguins of the frigid Northwestern islands. As long as he doesn't attack them or try to take food away from them, they leave him be.
   The Sidereal can even influence the behavior of a beast if he's aware of its presence. He can't give the beast complex commands, but he can cause it to take an action that the animal considers natural. He couldn't, for instance, command an alpha-male wolf to go back and attack the Sidereal's pursuers. He could, however, cause a lioness to choose a particular spot to lie in wait for prey to ambush, then later cause a gazelle to run past the hidden lioness on a path that leads back through the Sidereal's pursuer's camp. Suggesting an action in this manner requires a successful (Manipulation + Survival) roll and is normal mental influence.
   The resonant authority that this Charm provides can also aid in social dealing with local spirits or Lunars who consider the surroundings their home. While the Charm is active, the Sidereal may always channel Willpower through his Valor to aid in social dealings with them.</description>

            <description>The wilderness is not a hazard to itself, and each part unto its other parts is as one beautiful, moving Tapestry. By activating this Charm, the Sidereal becomes another part of the wild, and it accepts him warmly. The Exalt ignores the environmental impediments of the untamed wilderness, which is distinct from sculpted gardens or the body-realms of titans. This allows him to ignore external penalties or difficulty increases from these factors, the difficulties of unstable footing or water and muck (Exalted, p. 155), or exhaustion from extreme temperatures (Exalted, p. 130). On rolls that would suffer these penalties, the Seer may channel his Valor. The Exalt travels at his maximum overland travel speed with little effort, as if he were on a leisurely walk and ignoring any reductions to his travel speed due to weather, terrain or magic.
   With a Survival and Essence 3+ repurchase, the Sidereal has come to an understanding that all places are wilderness to those unfamiliar. He may activate this Charm to function in either true untamed wilderness or in more structured, cultivated places such as cities and towns. The Exalt cannot make use of both functions at once, and the divine structure of titan bodies remain too potent to ignore until Essence 4+.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal learns to bend the wilderness to her will. He can make minor changes in the scenery, such as moving a tree, changing a bend in a river or re-sculpting the jumbled aftermath of a rockslide. The Sidereal cannot shift around permanent, defining characteristics of the landscape, such as glaciers, canyons, volcanoes or island. He can shift only discrete features upon the landscape that teams of mortal laborers could physically move given a few weeks and proper equipment. Mortals could also cause an avalanche if they knew what part of an undercut ice-sheet to tamper with - and so can the Sidereal. A character can use this Charm to attack using elements of the landscape, such as dropping boulders from a cliff or a wasp's nest from a tree, or making a river-bank crumble to pitch an enemy into the water. These follow the normal attack sequence, but use (Wits + Survival) as the attacker's dice pool. The Storyteller defines the other effect of an attack, but damage should not exceed (Sidereal's Essence x 2) dice, whether lethal or bashing damage.</description>

            <errText>This Charm allows the Sidereal to shift any discrete piece of non-magical, untamed wilderness scenery, even important and 'permanent' landmarks like glaciers. The Exalt may move a tree, a grove of trees, a clearing in a forest, or even the whole forest if it is small enough. The target scenery and its destination must both be within (Essence x 50) yards of the Sidereal. Any other intertwined elements of scenery will stay where they are, and after the shift is complete both fit as naturally as they can into their new homes. Moving 'a plain' or 'a clearing' will cause the empty space to be filled with appropriate new scenery of negligible Resources value.
   If the targeted piece of scenery is larger than (Essence x 2) yards, it takes about an hour to make the transition, during which time it is not immune to further use of this Charm by an indecisive Sidereal or his competitors.
   Pieces of scenery that are up to (Essence x 2) yards travel in the course of a single tick, and may be used to make attacks. The Sidereal subjects those within the targeted area to an environmental hazard with (Essence) Trauma and Damage. It will tend to inflict bashing damage, though it may be lethal at the Storyteller's discretion based on the scenery used in the attack. These attacks tend to be Instant, but appropriate stunts may extend their effect or cause other hazards, as when the movement of a rock face causes a larger, natural avalanche.
   A Sidereal may use this Charm to perform sabotage on or to engineer demesnes (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. III - Oadenol's Codex, p. 51-54). In the former case, each use of the Charm is equivalent to a week's worth of sabotage, while in the latter it is equivalent to a month's worth of labor. This does allow the Exalt to ignore the need for a labor pool or tools, but she must still meet all the other requirements for manipulating a demesene. Remember that landscaping isn't the only or even most appropriate way to engineer particular types of demesnes.</errText>

        <description>The character can knot up the destinies of the wind and sky in a region, controlling its weather to aid or hinder others. The Vizier's player spends the motes and rolls (Stamina + Survival). Each success adds +1 to the difficulty of other characters' Survival or Resistance rolls to live in the affected area. (The player can apply fewer successes than rolled). The harsh weather lasts for one whole day and affects an area with a maximum radius of (Sidereal's Essence) miles. The nature of this harsh weather depends on the surroundings. It can be unseasonable for the region (such as torrential downpour in the dry season) but not freakish (such as a blizzard howling across the Southern deserts).
   If the Sidereal is so inclined, he can also use this Charm to alleviate harsh (natural) weather conditions. A single success on the (Stamina + Survival) roll calms the weather in the affected area. One success might be enough to counter some forms of deprivation, such as creating rain to help characters who suffer from thirst. In other cases, the Storyteller might reduce weather-related difficulties of or penalties to Survival or Resistance rolls by the number of successes rolled. If two characters attempt to use this Charm to opposing ends in the same overlapping area, the roll is contested.</description>

   With Survival 5+ and Essence 3+, a Sidereal may use this  Charm to create 'freakish' changes in weather, such as blizzards in the South. This increases the Cost of the Charm by +1wp, and its enforced Duration lasts for only an hour. With Survival 5+ and Essence 4+, a Sidereal's use of this Charm can cause weather that is a natural environmental hazard, on the level of the blistering heat/numbing cold described on Exalted, p. 131 normally. By adding +1wp to the Charm's Cost and reducing its Duration to One hour, more extreme weather on the level of severe sandstorms is possible. Creating hazards this way increases the difficulty of the roll to activate the Charm by +2.</description>
            <errText>This Charm cannot directly cause environmental hazards that inflict damage. The Sidereal cannot create a firestorm or deadly cold, but a bout of unseasonable warmth may lead to a forest fire naturally.</errText>

        <description>With an impassioned argument and a subtle tug on the strands of fate, the Sidereal can impose a goal on an Air elemental with an Essence no greater than her own. To do so, the Sidereal's player rolls (Manipulation + Survival) against the spirit's Dodge Mental Defense Value, adding the character's Essence in automatic successes. If the roll succeeds, the targeted spirit gains an Intimacy of the Seer's choosing - affection for one person, hostility to a particular town, a fear of a certain location or the like. The spirit may eventually discard this Intimacy, but it certainly lasts through one story.
   Characters can use this Charm on elementals of Earth, Fire, Water or Wood, but doing so adds +2 to the difficulty. If the targeted elemental's natural Motivation is specifically and diametrically opposed to the Intimacy the Sidereal tries to impose, the attempt becomes an unacceptable order.</description>

            <description>It is power beyond reckoning and often folly to demand of the gods of the sky, when one can trade with them instead. This Charm is a social attack against a spirit strongly associated with the wind and the air, including air elementals, gods of sail boats, ghosts whose death involved falling from a great height and many of Adorjan's children. The Exalt entreats the spirit to understand her own point of view, and in turn sympathizes with the desires of the divinity, rolling ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) and adding (Survival) extra successes.
   Success imposes an unnatural Emotion on both the Exalt and her target, the spirit gaining an Intimacy of the Sidereal's choice, while the Exalt gains an Intimacy that the spirit already possesses, chosen by the spirit's player. These Intimacies are strong and not easily shed. Social attacks that exploit them become unnatural influence, and to act contrary to or erode the Intimacy costs 1wp per scene. At the end of the current story, both lose their magic and become normal Intimacies.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip on which is written the Scripture of the Maiden Entombed. The Essence-infused paper flutters in the air next to the character, trailing golden sparkles like a congregation of admiring fireflies.
   While this Charm is active, the Sidereal becomes the master of an area of wilderness with a radius of (Sidereal's Essence) miles. As long as the character can see his prayer strip, he remains aware of anyone of interest to him in the affected area. (If creatures of interest use powers that render themselves immune to mundane tracking, the Sidereal must employ other supernatural means of awareness to track them).
   The Seer's command of the wild can grant anyone he chooses three automatic successes on all Survival rolls in the area or reduce an enemy's Survival rolls by the same amount. Affecting others thus forces the Sidereal to commit two more motes per person. The Sidereal can also use Adopting the Untamed Face on animals within the affected area, without the need for line of sight.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Maiden Entombed
   Once there was a maiden...
   ...who lived in a tomb, and the tomb was made in her image.
   Because she lived in a tomb, she became like the dead.
   She slept and dreamed.
   And sometimes woke, and walked within the confines of her tomb.
   "Why do you move?" her own ghost asked. "Why walk at all?"
   "I am not trapped while yet I run", said she.</comment>

            <errText>This Charm provides the following benefits while the Exalt stares at the prayer strip:
• The Sidereal can make valid rolls to perceive the area as if he were present throughout it.
• He may target perceived animals within the area with his Manipulation-based social attacks as long as he enhances the attack with Adopting the Untamed Face. He conveys his message through environment and scenery rather than words.
• The Exalt may use Dreaming the Wild Lands, increasing its range to encompass the area. Small changes, such as using the Charm to create hazard attacks, do not cost Willpower.
• Once per day, the Exalt may activate Sky and Rain Mantra at a discounted 0m Cost (Willpower surcharges apply normally for extreme weather).
• The number of successes or amount of external penalty the Exalt imposes on others' Survival and Resistance rolls to live in the area can range from 1 to 3. He may also, at his choice, pay 1wp to grant a target the benefits of Becoming the Wilderness for one day within the area.</errText>

        <description>The Sidereal prepares a throwing weapon and looks into the woven pattern of fate that binds her weapon and her target. She makes a throwing motion with her weapon. Rather than the weapon itself, however, she casts the shadow of the weapon at the target. The shadow homes in inexorably on the target at the Sidereal's command - potentially over several attack actions - until the shadow strikes true. When it does so, the shadow is replaced by the actual weapon, which disappears from the Sidereal's hand at last and appears stuck in the target.
   The target must be visible to the Sidereal and within the maximum range of her weapon. The Sidereal's player rolls (Dexterity + Thrown), ignoring penalties for weather and range when her character first attacks. If the attack misses, the Seer can redirect the shadow weapon on her next action with a subsequent (Dexterity + Thrown) roll. As long as she can still see the target, and her player attempts a Thrown roll every subsequent action, the Sidereal can keep redirecting the shadow weapon until it hits. The shadow weapon cannot be parried except by supernatural effects that specifically allow the character to parry immaterial attacks.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal makes the Inferior Sign of the Gull over his weapon before he throws it. If it hits, the attack adds the Sidereal's Essence to the raw damage. Then, if the weapon inflicts at least one level of damage, the weapon remains stuck in the wound and emits an eerie yellow light. The weapon continues to do so until the target removes the projectile. Removing it is a miscellaneous action that requires a (Strength + Athletics) roll. The light from the weapon extends yellow tendrils that snatch and pull in airborne objects. Such objects might be insects, loose debris, birds - or other foes' projectiles.
   Once per action, when anyone misses his target with a Thrown or Archery attack, the Sidereal may reflexively spend two motes of Essence. Doing so summons the errant projectile toward the embedded one. As a result, the person whose character missed with the attack reflexively rerolls the failed attack. Any Charms that supplemented or otherwise modified the original attack still apply to the rerolled one; the character does not need to pay to activate them. The Sidereal can spend these two motes to call for a reroll of a failed attack roll against the target. A botched attack against any target, from a character in range of the victim affected by this Charm, can be redirected to the Charm's victim.</description>

            <description>Weeping three tears of blood, the Sidereal raises his weapon to wipe them away, smearing it with three lost pangs of sorrow for his foes' plight. Imbued with this sense of regret, it becomes unthinkable that the weapon should fail in its mission. Thrown attacks using weapons enchanted with this Charm have their target number reduced by the wound penalty that the target is suffering. (If the target has powers that allow it to ignore or reduce wound penalties, Pain Amplification Stratagem uses the lowered wound penalty.) This cannot lower a target number below 4.
   If the attack should hit and inflict at least one level of damage, the target is wracked with unbelievable pain, causing them to lose temporary Willpower points equal to their wound penalty (minimum 1). A target reduced to 0 Willpower this way becomes Inactive for five ticks as they writhe in agony.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal twists a needle of glittering golden Essence between his fingers. The character can then throw this needle with a regular Thrown attack, using the same traits as a normal thrown needle from p. 371 of Exalted. The needle is intangible, so it completely ignores armor and cannot be parried.
   If the needle hits, the target uses his Conviction as a soak rating against the attack's damage. Each success on the damage roll inflicts one level of bashing damage. The Charm has an additional effect against ghosts: they cannot regain Essence while within Creation - from blood or any other sources - for one day per level of damage taken.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal sharpens the edges and points of his weapon on the threads of fate, lending it a baleful yellow glow. Enhanced by this Charm, a Thrown attack becomes undodgeable and ignores non-magical armor and natural soak. If the attack hits and inflicts at least one level of damage on a creature of darkness, the target is rendered incapable of respiring motes except through stunts and Charms for one day.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal activates this Charm with a prayer strip on which is written the Scripture of the Maiden and Shadow. He infuses the strip with Essence and hurls the prayer strip at a target within 100 yards. This attack can only be dodged, not parried: if the target tries to parry, the strip sticks to the parrying limb or weapon. If the strip hits the target, the strip sticks to him for the duration of the effect, wreathing him in a sickly yellow glow.
   With the prayer strip stuck to him, the target feels an insane compulsion (an unnatural mental influence) to hurt the Sidereal who put the strip there. Resisting this urge costs one Willpower point per scene. The compulsion remains for as long as the target can see or hear the Sidereal.
   Whenever the Sidereal takes damage during the effect's duration, a hatchet made of yellow Essence appears in one of his free hands. As a reflexive action, he may cast this hatchet at the target wrapped in the prayer strip at any distance up to a quarter of a mile away. The hatchet shrieks through the air, ignoring obstacles, and requiring no roll on the Sidereal's behalf. Only a perfect parry or dodge can prevent the hatchet from hitting the affected character. When it hits, it inflicts dice of lethal damage equal to the Sidereal's Essence. For each health level the target loses, the Sidereal heals one health level.
   The effect lasts until the target dies, the Sidereal ceases to commit the Essence or the prayer strip is destroyed. The Sidereal can have only one such prayer strip active at a time.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Maiden and Shadow
   Once there was a maiden...
   ...whose shadow fled from her. She chased it over fire and stone.
   She chased her shadow to a monster's mouth. Her shadow went right in. It didn't know how to stop.
   The maiden caught her shadow in a deep cave full of ghosts. Her shadow turned into a ball of thorns that wrapped around her. When the ghosts pricked their fingers on the thorns, they came to life. This didn't make anyone very happy.
   The maiden made a ladder from the ghosts' bones, but it only pointed downward. "Why go on?" her shadow asked.
   "I can't quit now", said she.</comment>

            <errText>Hitting with the prayer strip inflicts no damage. It cannot be removed short of destroying it. The Compulsion prevents the victim from removing or allowing the removal of the prayer strip. The Compulsion is resisted on a per action basis, not per scene, and it is ignored for the rest of the scene after doing so five times.
   The Sidereal may fling Essence hatchets in response to damaging attacks from characters other than the bearer of the prayer strip. These attacks occur in Step 9 as a Counterattack, preventing the use of other Counterattack effects on the part of the Exalt. Attacks without real harmful intent behind them or attacks against which the character chooses not to apply his DV do not allow the Sidereal to reflexively attack and heal. Sidereals may maintain as many uses of this Charm as they wish, to the limits of their motes, Willpower and health.</errText>

        <description>Destiny leads soldiers to a Sidereal's command. When the Sidereal engages in recruitment activities designed to drum up a mass combat unit (or heal one between battles), his efforts achieve the desired result in a fraction of the time. Whereas building up or healing a single dot of Magnitude normally takes a number of days equal to (the unit's current Magnitude + 1) - see Exalted, p. 169 - a Sidereal who uses this Charm can achieve the same result in half that time. The Sidereal can increase a unit's Magnitude by only one dot at a time with this Charm.</description>

        <description>Crimson stardust, visible only to Sidereals or characters with supernatural senses, wafts down from the sky onto a unit of soldiers, whose Magnitude cannot exceed the Sidereal's Essence. Every combatant, man, beast or spirit, gains a primal opposition to entities from beyond Creation. If the anointed soldiers face demons, the dead, the Fair Folk or other creatures of darkness during the five-day duration, the soldiers enjoy a +1 bonus to their Drill rating.
   A single Sidereal can affect a given unit only once at a time, but several Sidereals working together can affect the same unit simultaneously, increasing the bonus. The maximum bonus equals the highest Essence rating among the Sidereals activating the Charm simultaneously, but the unit's Magnitude cannot exceed the lowest Essence rating among their group.</description>

        <description>When the Sidereal oversees the training of a mass combat unit, he weaves the soldiers' destinies together. On the field, each soldier's confidence in his training shores up that of his fellow soldiers, making the entire unit stronger for their inter-woven resolve. Choose one of the House of Battles Abilities (Archery, Athletics, Melee, Presence, War) per dot of the Sidereal's Essence. While the Charm is active, mass combat rolls involving these Abilities have their target number reduced by 1, and each soldier in the unit counts as two for the purpose of enacting Battle Pattern Charms. The unit's Magnitude, however, cannot exceed the Sidereal's War rating.</description>

When the Sidereal commands the unit, the Charm automatically succeeds. If the character acts through the army's commander, the Charm requires a successful (Charisma + War) roll with difficulty 1 if the leader cooperates, 3 if the leader doubts the Sidereal's advice and 5 if the leader flatly refuses to take the Sidereal's advice and must be browbeaten or tricked into the proper tactics. When the effect is successful, the affected unit adds the Sidereal's Essence to the unit's Morale, while opposing forces suffer a one-die penalty to their attacks and Defense Values.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal can train a small team of spirits or Exalted into an elite fighting unit. This team can include no more members than the Sidereal has (War + Essence). When he trains them in this way, though, the Sidereal weaves their fates into a stout lash that strikes as one, even when the characters are not physically together.
   The individuals affected by the Charm are treated as a single being for the purposes of Sidereal astrology effects in the House of Battles. This solo unit's Essence equals the average of the group's members' ratings (rounded down) for determining the astrology effect's Scope. While the effect lasts, the Sidereal trainer's astrology effects in the House of Battles that are directed at the unit apply equally to each member of that team, even when those team members work independently.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, a Sidereal trains a group of gods or elementals in the battle tactics of the regional war gods. In so doing, he grants each a temporary promotion that increases the spirit's power on the field of battle. Unlike the preceding Training Mandate Charms, this one was not developed during the Primordial War. The Five Maidens allowed this Charm to come into being when their Sidereal generals planned the Usurpation... though the Maidens offered no comment on the Charm's potential uses.
   The Sidereal can affect (his Essence x 5) spirits at one time, and they retain its effects only for as long as they remain under his direct command. Each spirit so affected gains one temporary dot of Essence, 10 motes of Essence and any two spirit Charms the spirit does not already have that the Sidereal feels the spirit needs. These benefits last for one week. Also, for the rest of the week, the cost of using the Materialize Charm drops by an amount equal to (Sidereal's Essence x 5), to a minimum of one mote.
   This Charm works equally well on any god or elemental who accepts the command of the Sidereal using it.</description>

            <description>During the Primordial War, and later the Usurpation, it was necessary to quickly and effectively promote whatever allies the Sidereals could find into full-fledged battle assets. Though the Exalted often subverted many demons, and most gods were their allies, the vast majority were simply not great warriors. This Charm is a dramatic week-long training session with a group of spirits, instructing them in the ways of war and in the auspicious battle plans of Heaven.
   The spirits so trained gain the following benefits:
• They gain a bonus die on all Archery, Melee and War rolls. While this bonus lasts, they may internalize this lesson to improve their real rating in an Ability as a dramatic month-long Training effect. This cannot raise Abilities to ratings of 5+.
• If they lack them, they are temporarily granted First Excellencies in the Abilities of Archery, Dodge, Melee and War.
• They gain one temporary iteration of Ox-Body Technique, Essence Plethora, or Principle of Motion, at the Sidereal's discretion. This cannot grant a spirit more purchases of a Charm than they could normally learn, and while the effect lasts they may permanently learn the Charm as a dramatic month-long Training effect.
• While gathered as the majority of a mass combat unit, the spirits may materialize for the duration of a battle if their leader spends 1wp as a Miscellaneous action rallying them across the Chasm of the Material.
• They are considered to be full members of the Crimson Panoply of Victory. They are roughly considered to be gods of a rank one less than their personal power might indicate, to a maximum of Third Rank. This affords them the authority to command others with Mandates of Subordination and similar effects.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal must first activate Predestined Triumph Practice in order to use this Charm. He then urges his forces into a combat pattern that blocks and reroutes the flows of Essence that empower their enemies. Designing the pattern and properly arranging his troops into it requires a successful (Intelligence + War) roll. The maximum number of successes the Sidereal can achieve is equal to his permanent Essence - extra successes are lost.
   During the battle, every hero or sorcerer special character (see Exalted, p. 162) who enacts his part of the pattern receives an extra mote of Essence per action from the flows that the pattern disrupts. Each such character also adds a number of motes equal to the Sidereal's player's successes on the aforementioned roll to the costs of any Charms or sorcery used by the opposing army. This increase, however, cannot more than double the cost for a Charm or spell. For instance, an Essence 5 Sidereal leading an army with six special characters could add up to 30 motes to the cost of enemy Charms or spells; for instance, Rain of Doom could have its cost raised from 60 motes to 90. A minor Charm such as Fists of Iron Technique, however, would have its cost raised from just one mote to two.
   An army can benefit from only one Battle Pattern Charm in a given battle.</description>

            <description>Through the brilliant planning of the Sidereal Exalted, the stymied efforts of foemen become the raw vigor of the Vizier's allies. A Sidereal may activate this Charm to enhance a mass combat unit in which he is a leader or special character. On each of the unit's action ticks, the leader and every special character in the unit gains one offensive mote in their Overdrive pools; those characters who possess no Overdrive pool gain a temporary five-mote pool while this Charm is active, which begins empty (characters who already possess Overdrive pools do not raise the size of their pool).
   A unit can benefit from only one Battle Pattern Charm at a time.</description>

        <description>The character activates this Charm just as he would activate Essence-Draining Battle Pattern. This battle pattern, however, is designed to help straighten out the strands of fate disrupted by the presence of inhabitants of the Demon Realm. The Sidereal's player makes the same (Intelligence + War) roll after activating Predestined Triumph Practice, and counts the successes up to a maximum equal to his Essence. During the battle, every hero or sorcerer who enacts his part of the pattern imposes that number as a dice-pool penalty on one special character on the opposing side. Alternatively, every hero or sorcerer who does his part to form the pattern can impose a cumulative -1 penalty on the enemy's commander's War rolls. This alternative imposed penalty cannot exceed the Sidereal's Essence or reduce the commander's dice pool below zero.
   After the Usurpation, the Five-Score Fellowship petitioned the Maidens to create analogous Charms against the Fair Folk and denizens of the Underworld. Chaos-Quelling Battle Pattern and Ghost-Banishing Battle Pattern work exactly the same way as Demon-Blocking Battle Pattern, except for the class of supernatural enemies the Charms affect. An army can benefit from only one Battle Pattern Charm in a given battle.</description>

            <description>Like a wall of blades and terror sprung up from nothing, the Viziers of the Primordial War shrouded their armies in tactics impenetrable to the demon rulers of Creation. A Sidereal may activate this Charm to enhance a mass combat unit in which he is a special character. When a unit composed of creatures of darkness target the Sidereal's with their actions, they suffer a -1 external penalty to any relevant rolls. If the creature of darkness unit is engaged in close combat with the Sidereal's, the penalty applies to all its non-reflexive actions.
   A unit can benefit from only one Battle Pattern Charm at a time, but the effects of multiple Sidereals enacting this Pattern within the same unit are cumulative, to a maximum of (lowest permanent Essence amongst the Sidereals).
   As the Exalted turned their attention from the titanic forces within Creation to the chaotic forces without, the Sidereals learned to apply this Charm's principles against even shaped Fair Folk. Learning to do so requires Essence 4+ and a weeklong training session with a tutor, or three times as long without a teacher.</description>

        <description>As with the other Battle Pattern Charms, the Sidereal first must activate Predestined Triumph Practice. The Vizier sends Essence through a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Maiden At War. The strip burns to ash, leaving the characters of the scripture glowing redly in the air. The Sidereal then names a god or elemental the Sidereal wants to appear and intervene on his side of the battle. The spirit can have a maximum Essence of 5 if a lone character performs this Charm; but at most, one Sidereal of the other castes may assist the Charm's user. Each additional participant adds 1 to the maximum possible Essence of the summoned spirit.
   The Sidereal's player's dice pool to summon and bind the chosen spirit starts at zero. Each death of a spirit or Exalt among his forces, or every 20 mortals slain, adds one die to this pool. When the Sidereal decides he has sacrificed enough of his troops for the sake of victory, the player rolls the dice pool against a difficulty of the chosen spirit's Essence.
   If this roll succeeds, the chosen spirit must appear, already bound to the Sidereal. Either it must perform whatever task the Vizier asks, with no retribution afterwards, or the spirit must serve the Sidereal for a year and a day... and take whatever revenge the spirit wants afterward.
   As usual, a character may apply only one battle pattern at a time.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture of the Maiden at War
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...whose battles called her far from home.
   She slew the thing she feared most, and conquered the land that feared her.
   As she fought, far away, she knew her children needed guidance.
   She knew they faced tyrants.
   She knew they faced fear.
   In her homeland, things were broken.
   So, she held up her hand before the sun, cast a shadow on the world and drowned the troubles of her home in darkness.
   "Survival's a long reach", she said.</comment>

            <errText>This Charm is activated per the other Battle Pattern Charms. The Sidereal may name any spirit within the Essence limits of the Charm, including demons and ghosts. Spirit-Binding Battle Pattern accumulates one die for the loss of each Essence 1-3 Essence user or 100 mortals, and it gains two dice for the loss of every Essence 4+ Essence user. The roll is not against the desired spirit's Essence, but is played out per sorcerous summoning and binding (Exalted, pp. 252-253). The Sidereal may channel his Conviction to enhance his rolls to bind or banish the spirit.
   Once the spirit is summoned, this Charm ends whether or not it is bound to service, and another Battle Pattern may be enacted or another Spirit-Binding Battle Pattern may be attempted.</errText>
