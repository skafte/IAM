         Like their lesser creations, the Yozis can channel Essence to make themselves more competent at tasks. Befitting their nature, however, the Yozis do not think in terms of innate talent or learned skill (i.e., Attributes or Abilities), but rather according to the concepts they embody. Thus, Malfeas is mightiest when he takes a direct approach, while the Ebon Dragon must act indirectly and subtly to exert his full glory. So long as the action in question meets the criteria established for the Yozi in question, this Charm can enhance actions using any combination of Attribute and/or Ability. Only one iteration of First (Yozi) Excellency may improve a given action.
         The Storyteller should adjudicate the applicability of this Charm as he would judge applicability of specialties and stunts, rewarding players who work to stay in theme and denying those who would push these Excellencies into universally applicable bonuses. As always, clear and consistent rulings will go a long way to keeping players happy. Infernals must learn each Yozi's Excellency separately. Furthermore, a character can and must purchase each version of the Charm a number of times equal to her Essence rating as a Training effect when she first learns the Excellency or upon raising her Essence later. Consequently, each Excellency taken at character creation needs two Charm slots (assuming Essence 2), so players should plan Charm selections accordingly.
         First (Yozi) Excellency adds dice to enhance valid actions using the same costs and rules as the First Excellency of the Lawgivers (see Exalted, page 183). If the action uses only an Attribute or Ability and not a combination of the two, the dice limit is the (used trait + Essence) instead. The italicized words and phrases in the descriptions below provide the core themes of each Yozi purview. The more of these relate to a given action, the more likely that a Storyteller should consider the action eligible for enhancement with the Excellency.
         Adorjan: The Silent Wind is restless, always in motion and never satisfied. She expresses the inevitability that bad things happen regardless of who you are or how many backup plans you have. She is catastrophe and calamity, the unconsidered variable that shreds the best-laid plans of Yozi and Exalt alike. She kills because it is her nature to hurt everything she touches, not because she revels in suffering. More than any of her siblings, Adorjan is insane and encompasses contradictions. Adorjan scours her enemies, breakingthem to enlightenthem, even if the lesson proves fatal. Her actions display vicious whimsy, especially toward the complacent and comfortable. She loves purposeful chaos that exposes the flaws in systems and lays low the proud, but she abhors chaos for the sake of chaos as much as she abhors stasis. She is a balancing force of wickedness against the excesses of the righteous. Her depredations inspire heroes to reach their full potential through the crucible of tragedy, invariably ruining their lives in the process. Greatness is the worst curse her touch imparts. She inflicts more pain on those she loves than those she hates. No one expects her. She refuses to be understood and torments those who try.
         This Charm can enhance any action that causes unexpected or sudden harm, such as surprise attacks or attacks that are part of flurries. Actions that create ongoing discomfort or take away sources of comfort also fall under the purview of the Silent Wind. Socially, her attacks tear away Intimacies rather than building them, teaching people to let go of attachmentsand worries rather than continue meaningless cycles of love or vengeance. The behaviors she compels are mad and invariably disturbing, but she does not care how the minds of others break. Adorjan's power may be applied to any actions that help tear down structured society or spread anarchy, regardless of the reasons or methods for doing so. The Charm can't assist actions that are planned in great detail in advance, though it is permissible to do something whose consequences will not manifest until a later time. Actions motivated by insanity may only benefit from Adorjan's touch when there is some greater and immediate purpose behind them (even if the meaning isn't communicated to other characters). The Silent Wind embodies the madness of the freed mind, not an idiot's babbling.
         Cecelyne: The Endless Desert is patient and deliberate. She holds back, amassing resources until she can overwhelm her opposition. Her law places the strong over the weak, celebrating a doctrine of arbitrary and capricious hypocrisy. She demands reverence from allies and enemies alike and works terrifying and wondrous miracles to expand her worship. She is deeply insightful into the desires and failures of others and owns those whose wishes she fulfills. She borders everything and eternity, so everyone comes to her in time. Her heart overflows with desolation, turning all around her to literal or metaphorical wasteland. When her patience runs out or her plans reach fruition, her rage is sudden and shocking.
         Characters may apply this Charm to any actions in which they build on prior planning and effort to succeed more thoroughly or carefully. Cecelyne's Excellency also assists actions that give others what they want in order to influence and ultimately own them. She also helps punish those who break a deal or betray their loyalty to the Infernal or his laws. The Charm may assist any attempt to amass or jealously protectresources that are directly useful to the Exalt's established plans, but has no power to help spur-of-the-moment whims, acts of meaningless self-indulgence or displays of truly selfless altruism. The Endless Desert helps Infernals endure unrelent-ingly harsh conditions, whether physical or social, as well as resist challenges to their long-term plans. The Charm does not help characters resist random misfortune, nor can it thwart actions of those advancing an agenda unrelated to the Infernal's long-term goals.
         Ebon Dragon: The Shadow of All Things is Other, not wholly of the world nor fully alien to its precepts like the Neverborn. He is self-indulgent and without consciencebut can be trusted to act with enlightened self-interest at all times, making him the most dependable and trustworthy of the Yozis so long as those dealing with him don't forget his nature. He corrupts and seduces others away from virtue and honor because these concepts are poisonous to him rather than because he wants to enlighten or enslave. He genuinely believes the universe should be darkened until it approaches his unholy perfection, but his warped magnanimity hides a deeper and greater hatred of all light - literal or metaphoric. The Ebon Dragon is hollow, assembling his semblance of identity from lies, copied mannerisms and observed vices, constantly recreating himself in the image of whatever offends and frightens his adversaries the most. Moreover, he is The Nemesis, finding greater joy in thwarting the dreams of others than advancing his own agenda. Whereas the Silent Wind brings agonizing freedom to others, the Ebon Dragon can't abide his own restraint, whether by prison walls or social mores.
         This Excellency enhances actions that attack morality, break established moral codes or cheat in lieu of playing fair. This includes most criminal acts, except in societies where crime functions with the knowledge and quiet approval of the reigning government. Direct and intentional violations of the laws of Yu-Shan or the dictates of Cecelyne always offer chances for antagonism. The Shadow of All Things gleefully turns heroes into villains or reveals to a self-styled heroine how her actions were actually villainous all along. While a character with this Excellency experiences confinement or restraint, the Charm can only enhance actions that help him break free from that immediate imprisonment until he has done so. The Charm also can't assist actions that knowingly help anyone else more than they help the Infernal, even when he still stands to profit a great deal. A third limitation is that the character can't use the Charm when being honest, unless revealing a horrid truth that will hurt or debase the listener. Finally, all actions must show subtlety, if not outright guile. Choosing a brazen course of action over a subtle one forfeits any opportunity to use this Charm. In these restrictions, the Ebon Dragon's Excellency offers the most and least freedom of any Yozi.
         Malfeas: The fallen King of the Primordials is arrogant, cruel and given to excessive displays of obvious force for the chance to show off and the sadistic joy he feels when enemies and allies look upon him in awe and terror. He is vast and full of hate toward those who betrayed and imprisoned him, seeking vengeance with indiscriminate callousness to the collateral damage he inflicts on the innocent. The Demon City is resilient and strong enough to lift the world or crush it underfoot. The green fires raging in his heart blight the very Essence of everything they touch, marking the world with his wrathful glory. He holds authority over all things wise enough to bow before the world's creators.
         Characters may apply this Charm to any actions in which they choose the ostentatious or overkill approach over merely adequate solutions. Any intentional subtlety or display of restraint makes this Excellency inapplicable, including adding less than half the maximum possible dice bonus to a roll (rounded down). Note that force does not necessarily equate to violence. A forceful seduction in which an Infernal confidently orders a prospective paramour to accompany him rather than cajoling or flattering her can benefit from this Charm just as readily as a stomp delivered to a prone enemy's face. Strangely, the power of Malfeas may also enhance any Performance action to dance or create music. These are the secret pleasures of the Demon City that embarrass Ligier.
         She Who Lives In Her Name: The Principle of Hierarchy is methodical and meticulous. She analyzes every variableand chooses the most efficient and orderly method by which to achieve victory. Her utilitarianism is absolute and consistent as clockwork. She is as brilliant as she is alien, cold and unfeeling. Her violence is dispassionate and perversely pure, unmotivated by sadism and yet capable of systematically disassemblingevery obstacle in her path without the slightest remorse. She builds and improves structures of all kinds and abhors chaos, randomness and free will in all its forms. She finds excessive effort wasteful and prefers to apply the minimum exertion necessary to attain the desired outcome. Her directives are fascist and totalitarian, but ruthlessly fair. She has no moral restraint against deception, nor any attachment to honesty, but her nature must choose the most expedient method even when it is not the solution that best matches her talents. She demands perfection, especially from herself.
         Characters may apply this Charm to actions that create new order or reinforce existing order in any way, as well as actions that encourage others to join and loyally follow any hierarchical organization. She Who Lives In Her Name enhances efficient actions that demonstrate appropriate use of force; her power does not aid half-hearted or excessive efforts. Showing empathy for individuals invalidates that action for enhancement, though empathy toward society or another collective structure is permissible. The Charm enhances actions carried out methodically and logically but not improvised or unconventional solutions. Spreading chaos is never allowed, but ineffective organizations and policies may be dismantled to pave the way for a better order.

In these restrictions, the Ebon Dragon's Excellency offers the most and least freedom of any Yozi.
            Kimbery: The Great Mother is endlessly giving and too often forgiving, a self-defined victim of endless betrayal. She holds others to impossibly high standards, but thinks she is fair. Secrets are among the greatest purviews of her depths, particularly shameful truths and those kept with force and guile. Though her patronage and kindness are real, spurning her incites fury that drowns all opposition in her corrosive touch. Kimbery hides ugliness beyond imagining beneath playful waves of beauty, charm and poise.
            The Great Mother rejects the immediacy of brute force violence in favor of poison, acid, bleeding, curses, disease and other tactics that perpetuate spiteful suffering without further effort. Her social tricks follow the same logic, stirring undercurrentsof distrust and dissent beneath the polite surface of society until the entire organization dissolves. Some Yozis call Kimbery lazy and cowardly for striking once and holding back while afflicted victims weaken, but she considers this elegant practicality.
            Everything she does harms someone or sets them up to suffer worse in the future, but she is capable of martyring herself to be the one in pain. Because her depths hold no lasting generosity, she demands payment proportional to her sacrifice. Whether beneficiaries ask for her gifts or not doesn't matter, but she gleefully tortures those who insult her by refusing her largesse. Those who cannot pay her back conventionally pay with screams.
            She takes great pride in brokering deals, offering the just and true their darkest desires so that she may see them brought low. She considers herself to be the ultimate trafficker, moving everything from worlds to secrets, with a discerning eye for an advantageous bargain. She has a talent for temptation, using secret lusts against her enemies as a rookinto further disfigurement.
            That Kimbery takes pleasure in the agonies of subordinates is her worst-kept secret, but she sacrifices this joy to avoid wasting what is hers. She shows no restraint in tormenting enemies, punishing them for actual transgressions and venting her bottled-up fury toward all who escape punishment. The Sea That Marched Against the Flame loves to warp herself and others into new shapes as useful as they are uncomfortable, imagining herself a great artist. She may be right, but even her siblings find her aesthetics bizarre and vile.
            Kimbery's Excellency aids actions that create disturbing art in any media, whether conventional paintings and sculptures or artful blood spatters on a wall. Appropriate stunts can make almost anything into vile art. Her power helps keep secrets by any means necessary. This Charm assists all actions to cause delayed or ongoing harm. Purely immediate harm falls outside Kimbery's purview unless punishing someone who has benefited from her help or betrayed her love. She may also impose harm for the sadistic joy of doing so rather than expediency or necessity.
            Malfeas: The fallen King of the Primordials is arrogant, cruel and given to excessive displays of obvious force for the chance to show off and the sadistic joy he feels when enemies and allies look upon him in awe and terror. He is vast and full of hate toward those who betrayed and imprisoned him, seeking vengeance with indiscriminate callousness to the collateral damage he inflicts on the innocent. The Demon City is resilient and strong enough to lift the world or crush it underfoot. The green fires raging in his heart blight the very Essence of everything they touch, marking the world with his wrathful glory. He holds authority over all things wise enough to bow before the world's creators.
            Characters may apply this Charm to any actions in which they choose the ostentatious or overkill approach over merely adequate solutions.

            She Who Lives In Her Name: The Principle of Hierarchy is methodical and meticulous. She analyzes every variableand chooses the most efficient and orderly method by which to achieve victory. Her utilitarianism is absolute and consistent as clockwork. She is as brilliant as she is alien, cold and unfeeling.

         Yozis revel in the exercise of their purview, drawing power from the very strategies they use to spread that power through Creation. This Charm may be purchased once for each First (Yozi) Excellency the character knows, though she can only enhance a given action with one of the versions. Whenever the Infernal succeeds while stunting on an action that could benefit from the appropriate Excellency, she may choose to receive the alternate rewards listed below instead. Characters may partake of these awards even if they did not use the pertinent Excellency to assist the action, just so long as doing so was an option.
         Adorjan: The Silent Wind defines her path as a field of opposition over which she must scour her legend. Her passage is death. One perceived target within (Essence) yards suffers dice of unsoakable lethal damage equal to the stunt rating from flensing breezes that swirl around him. Magical beings may reduce the raw damage by one die per three motes spent, sheltering their souls within an ablative layer of Essence.
         Cecelyne: The Endless Desert is a creature of balance, forming the dividing line between Creation and Malfeas, the finite and infinite. A successful two or three point stunt provides Willpower in addition to motes, rather than forcing the character to select one or the other.
         Ebon Dragon: The Shadow of All Things is an unstoppable force of antagonism. Unlike the permutations of other Yozis, the Ebon Dragon's version of this Charm may enhance the stunt itself rather than its reward, converting the bonus dice into bonus successes. If the stunt succeeds, the character has already reaped the rewards of his dark glory and gains nothing further.
         Malfeas: Exercising unrestrained force stokes the flames at the heart of the Demon City, doubling any motes awarded for the successful stunt.
         She Who Lives In Her Name: The flame-filled spheres of the Transcendent Hierarchy know their purpose, individually and especially jointly as part of a greater identity. The Infernal doubles any Willpower points awarded by the stunt.

            Malfeas: Any motes granted by Malfeas Mythos Exultant are attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Infernal's Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Infernal may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.
            Adorjan: The Infernal can manifest the flensing wind only when she receives a stunt reward.
            Ebon Dragon: The Infernal may choose to convert any stunt dice he receives to automatic successes. Each die converted lowers his next stunt reward by one mote (minimum zero). He cannot choose a Willpower reward if he has converted any dice with this Charm.

      <description>The Yozis exist beyond fate, warping the flow of causality merely through the lightest touch of their cosmic infinitude. Whenever an Infernal activates the appropriate First (Yozi) Excellency to improve a rolled action, she may pay an additional Willpower to lower the enhanced action's target number to 6. This benefit is not cumulative with other effects that reduce target number. The Shaping effect of this Charm warps reality as a whole rather than any individual target; the improved Excellency use does not itself become a Shaping effect. Infernals with Essence 7+ no longer need to spend Willpower to benefit from this Charm; such characters automatically drop the target number of rolled actions to 6 whenever they use the appropriate First (Yozi) Excellency.</description>

         The more a Yozi uses its power to affect an encounter, the more its Essence begins to saturate the area and harmonize it with the fallen titan's efforts. This Charm may be purchased once for each iteration of First (Yozi) Excellency the character knows. Each iteration of Effortless (Yozi) Dominance triggers whenever the Infernal activates its prerequisite, cumulatively reducing the subsequent cost to do so in the scene by one mote, to a minimum cost of zero motes.
         For example, if an Infernal uses First Kimbery Excellency to add three dice to a roll, this costs three motes. The second use of that Charm in the scene to add another three dice to an action costs only two motes, and so on. Note that the progression of cost reduction only depends on the number of times the Charm gets used rather than the number of motes spent on any activation. Even a zero mote Excellency use requires a standard Charm activation to do so.

      <description>The Yozis do not need to think to express their natures. They simply act, and success flows through that action. This Charm may be purchased once for each iteration of First (Yozi) Excellency the character knows. While active, So Speaks (Yozi) allows an Infernal to use its prerequisite as an innate power rather than a Charm activation. If the Infernal also knows the appropriate Effortless (Yozi) Dominance, he can choose whether to pay the full cost of the Excellency to wield it innately or use it as a Charm to enjoy the cost reduction. The same rules apply if any other effects reduce the Excellency's cost.</description>

            This Charm permanently alters the cost of the chosen Yozi's Excellency. The First Excellency now grants two dice for every mote spent on it, while the Second Excellency allows successes to be purchased for one mote each. (Yozi) Inevitability Technique can be activated for a cost of four motes instead of a point of Willpower.
            So Speaks (Yozi) is incompatible with any other Charm that provides cost discounts to the Excellencies, such as Effortless (Yozi) Dominance.

         By the power of the Primordials, Creation came into existence and elements, deities and even life upon it. Sorcery is this power, filtered down through fractured glimpses of understanding that cannot begin to describe the intricate elegance of the universe. To be a sorcerer is to be mad with jagged shards of cosmic awareness and with will and might enough to impose that madness on the world.
         This cluster of Charms each grant the shallowest fragments of supernal wisdom, enough to learn and cast spells of the Emerald Circle. Subsequent purchases of the same version unlock higher circles. Spells require the usual costs and spell-shaping actions when cast this way. Each variation of this Charm belongs to one of the Yozis and grants a particular benefit that may be invoked whenever that Charm is used to cast a spell. In addition to these powers, each variant imposes the themes and imagery of the appropriate Yozi upon every spell cast using that initiation. For example, tarnished brass blades with barbed stingers replace obsidian butterflies for the Malfean spell that comes out Death of Brass Wasps. This substitution of imagery never materially alters the effects of a spell except in the slightest of ways and is not optional. The player may select the modified imagery with Storyteller approval.
         The integration of Yozi themes can be subtle or overt and may even vary with each casting of the same spell, but Yozi power resists efforts to hide its glory. Even if the sorcerer attempts to minimize the warping effects on his sorcery by integrating extremely minor special effects, observers with Occult 1+ still recognize the taint with a reflexive (Wits + Occult) roll at difficulty 5. The only way to completely hide a Yozi's influence is to cast a spell that already completely resonates with the Yozi's thematic imagery, such as when Malfeas hurls Total Annihilation or the Ebon Dragon disgorges Summoning the Heart of Darkness.
         Sorcerers may learn as many different initiations as they meet the prerequisites for. They can't cast a spell using multiple initiations at once, however.
         This Charm may be purchased a second time by Infernals with Essence 4+, deepening the patterns of creative psychosis through which miracles occur. Such characters may learn and cast Sapphire Circle spells with the benefits and drawbacks of their initiation, though it is harder to hide the warping touch of the Yozis (difficulty 3 to recognize as above). A third and final purchase of this Charm at Essence 5+ unlocks the core truths of forces and principles by which worlds were fashioned and allows learning and casting of Adamant Circle spells within the bounds of initiation. Such spells proclaim the Yozi whose glory they express with all the subtlety of Erembour's horn (difficulty 1 to recognize).
         Spells with any Holy effects represent innovations of Creation's Exalted never dreamed by the Primordials and whose nature is antithetical to Yozi Essence. Such magic can't be learned. Primordial sorcery does not bind demons through the oaths of the vanquished Yozis, but rather in fulfillment of Cecelyne's cruel law. Infernal sorcerers cannot learn conventional demon summoning spells, but they may learn variations that non-Yozi-bound sorcerers cannot hope to understand (see below). The spell Summon Elemental is also forbidden by incompatible Essence. Finally, each Yozi has taboos against its nature that prohibit casting or learning of certain spells with that initiation. Spells not included in the Exalted corebook that are mentioned below may be found in The Book of Sorcery, Vol. II - The White Treatise.
         Adorjan: The Silent Wind goes where she wills and lets none gainsay her. Her initiation holds special sway over spells that can accelerate a journey, whether by actual quickening, teleportation or some other means. Spells that summon or create beings for the purpose of conveyance do not count, for Adorjan sails on nothing but herself and refuses to admit the utility of Cecelyne's domain. Such spells come effortlessly to the wandering windstorm and cost no Willpower to cast. Adorjan kills as she passes among her enemies, not from afar. Spells that attack or impose harm to other characters past close-combat range cost an additional Willpower.
         Cecelyne: The laws of the Endless Desert guide the interactions of her sorcery and entities called upon to attend her will. Use of her initiation reduces the cost of all spells that naturally summon, bind or banish other beings by 10 motes and one Willpower (minimum five motes, one Willpower). Cecelyne is equally at home dominating the Minions of the Eyeless Face as demons. Her taboo bars any spell from creating edible food or potable water and spells that create or manipulate the element of wood as a primary effect. Spells that only produce forbidden effects as a side effect rather than their primary purpose may be warped in such a way as to remove this ancillary benefit but cannot be cast as they are. For example, the City-Swallowing Sandstorm Attack that replaces the monsoon of a traditional Torrential Cascade leaves choking dunes instead of drinkable water, but Cecelyne has no means of adapting a spell like Food from the Aerial Table or Sprouting Shackles of Doom to her aesthetic of desolation.
         Ebon Dragon: Shadows of all sorts belong to the Shadow of All Things. Spells that naturally create or manipulate shadows or darkness or otherwise dampen light or incorporate reflections as a primary effect cost 10 motes and one Willpower less (minimum five motes, one Willpower). The same discount applies to spells that specifically open or shatter physical barriers such as doors or walls. Spells that incorporate these elements solely because of using this initiation do not count. Examples of valid spells include Open the Spirit Door, Shadow Summons, Shadowy Simulacrums of Smoke, The Spy Who Walks In Darkness, The Violent Opening of Closed Portals, Shadow Theft, Shadows of the Ancient Past, Summon the Heavenly Portal, Summoning the Heart of Darkness, The Crumbling Walls, Curse of Unyielding Mist, Evocation From the Mirror and Technique Mirror. The Ebon Dragon is as incapable of casting spells that generate meaningful illumination as Cecelyne is incapable of creating food and drink. This limitation may be bypassed to the same extent through spell warping.
         Malfeas: Spells that inflict damage as their primary effect such as Death of Obsidian Butterflies or Total Annihilation resonate with the hate of the Demon City, increasing their base damage by half again before attack successes factor in. For example, Death of Brass Wasps inflicts 12L rather than 8L. Spells that inflict damage over time may be enhanced this way, but only the first instance of damage inflicted against a particular victim gets the boost. Further damage to the same target does not increase, though those the spell has yet to damage are fair game. The Sorcerous Enlightenment of Malfeas cannot cast spells that bring peace or physical calm (however confused and mad). Examples include Mists of Eventide, Paralyzing Contradiction, The Battle's End, Wheel of the Turning Heavens and Winds of Confusion. The only calm that may result from his spells is the stillness that descends upon battlefields in the wake of the devastation he unleashes.
         She Who Lives In Her Name: The Principle of Hierarchy abhors free will with every mote of her being. Spells that seek to override another's free will, beliefs or memories cost 10 motes and one Willpower less than normal (minimum five motes, one Willpower). Examples of valid spells include Commanding the Beasts, Corrupted Words, Curse of Slavish Humility, Droning Suggestion, Peacock Shadow Eyes, Silent Words of Dreams and Nightmares, Song of the Waves, Sorcerer's Irresistible Puppetry, Theft of Memory, Insidious Tendrils of Hate, Threefold Binding of the Heart and Mirage of Protective Shelter. Spells that summon and bind entities fall under the touch of Cecelyne, not She Who Lives In Her Name. The Principle of Hierarchy does not believe in violence unless it is absolute; accordingly, Emerald and Sapphire spells whose primary purpose is inflicting damage cost an additional one Willpower.

The Ebon Dragon is as incapable of casting spells that generate meaningful illumination as Cecelyne is incapable of creating food and drink. This limitation may be bypassed to the same extent through spell warping.
            Kimbery: The Sea That Marched Against the Flame is inherently aquatic, and this flavors her initiation of sorcery. Spells that predominantly manipulate or associate with liquid cost 10 motes and one Willpower less than usual (minimum cost five motes and one Willpower). Examples include Impervious Sphere of Water, The Parting of the Seas, River of Blood, Unstoppable Fountain of the Depths, Water From Stone, Written Upon The Water and Torrential Cascade. The same discount also applies to spells solely useful in an aquatic environment like Calling The Wind's Kiss, Floral Ferry, Lightning Whip Smites The Water, Mast-Shattering Spell, Storm Rider Enchantment, Viridian Mantle of Underwater Journeys and Summon Spirit Boat. Finally, spells that naturally impose harm through acid or poison resonate with her initiation, such as Assassin's Fatal Touch, Plague of Bronze Snakes, Blood of Boiling Oil, Geyser of Corrosion and Rain of Doom. Kimbery's power loathes fire in all forms, so she cannot cast spells that create or manipulate fire or other burning energy as the primary effect. So deep is her antipathy that she cannot even adapt intrinsically fiery spells to her imagery.
            Malfeas: Spells that inflict damage as their primary effect such as Death of Obsidian Butterflies or Total Annihilation resonate with the hate of the Demon City, increasing their base damage by half again before attack successes factor in. For example, Death of Brass Wasps inflicts 12L rather than 8L. Spells that inflict damage over time may be enhanced this way, but only the first instance of damage inflicted against a particular victim gets the boost. Further damage to the same target does not increase, though those the spell has yet to damage are fair game.

            She Who Lives In Her Name: The Principle of Hierarchy abhors free will with every mote of her being.

Spells that summon and bind entities fall under the touch of Cecelyne, not She Who Lives In Her Name. The Principle of Hierarchy does not believe in violence unless it is absolute; accordingly, Emerald and Sapphire spells whose primary purpose is inflicting damage cost an additional one Willpower.

         The Primordials did not wait to exert their will over Creation and the crashing maelstroms of the Wyld at its shores, their authority rooted in the elegant ecology of superior might. The Green Sun Princes now emulate this splendor with a Charm of their devising, hastening their growth toward unknowable transcendence.
         As a permanent upgrade, the Infernal can spend experience to buy his Essence rating up to a dot higher than his age should permit (see Exalted, p. 275). Each version of this Charm carries a different drawback depending on the Yozi used as a springboard for enlightenment. These drawbacks persist only as long as the character's Essence rating is higher than it could be without this Charm. Upon reaching the age that Essence 10 is naturally available, the Infernal replaces this Charm with another of his choice. Characters may only learn a single Ascendancy Mantle of (Yozi).
         Adorjan: When the Infernal violates his Urge, he automatically gains (Essence) points of Limit rather than rolling.
         Cecelyne: This Charm is Messianic (Cult 4). If the Infernal's Cult rating drops below this thresh-old, he loses all benefit from his excess Essence dot (high-Essence Charms, superhuman Attributes and Abilities, larger Essence pool, etc) while he has Cult 3 or less.
         Ebon Dragon: The Ebon Dragon's hollow Essence pervades the warlock, rendering him incapable of channeling Virtues.
         Kimbery: This Charm has the Sea Keyword. While not in proximity to a sea, the Infernal loses all benefit from excess Essence (similar to Cecelyne).
         Malfeas: The first five boxes of the Infernal's Limit track are always full.
         She Who Lives In Her Name: The Whispering Flame is unforgiving of deviation from proper purpose. When the character commits an Act of Villainy to mitigate Limit, he rolls only one die, regardless of his Virtue ratings.

      <description>Ebon Dragon Yozi-Body Unity: The Ebon Dragon's body is simultaneously material and dematerialized, allowing him to perceive and physically interact with beings and objects in either state as though he shared that state. He can walk through sanctum entrances like a dematerialized being but may ignore them as a materialized being. All the results of his actions likewise benefit from this unique nature. If another effect defines the character's state as exclusively material or incorporeal, he may ignore that effect at will to exist between states. A second purchase at Essence 7+ removes the need for sustenance, air and sleep and grants immunity to non-magical disease, plus lets him hear prayers from any realm of existence (but doesn't make him a spirit). This Charm may not be learned through the Eclipse anima power or equivalent effects, save for Primordial Principle Emulation (see Glories of the Most High - The Unconquered Sun, page 30 - 31).</description>

      <description>Ebon Dragon Cosmic Principle: This Charm shapes the Ebon Dragon's Essence into a single Personal pool with a capacity of 1,000 motes and makes him immune to aging, but it imposes the Greater Imperfection of Ultimate Darkness on him. Upon learning this Charm, a character loses all non-Ebon Dragon Charms and Combos containing such Charms (and the capacity to learn such powers), converting lost magic into appropriate experience points. If an Exalt, his Exaltation departs as it no longer recognizes him as human, leaving him with "only" the Primordial power he has become. He may adapt thematically appropriate Charms from other Yozis to his own imagery and principles as Ebon Dragon Charms without regard for their prerequisites, but he can't teach these Charms to others. Once learned, this Charm and permanent Charms building off it do not deactivate if the character loses permanent Essence for any reason. The fetich of the Ebon Dragon cannot channel this Charm or any Charm requiring it as a prerequisite, as the part cannot be the whole. This Charm may not be learned through the Eclipse anima power or equivalent effects, save for Primordial Principle Emulation (see Glories of the Most High - The Unconquered Sun, page 30 - 31).</description>

He can unleash any possible Combo of his Charms without needing to spend Willpower to do so or declare which Charms he intends to activate (as long as the Combo is valid). Moreover, all of his Charms gain the Combo-OK keyword. He can even use reflexive Charms while casting spells, but he cannot do so to enhance the spell in any way. Finally, he is immune to all harm from Ebon Dragon Charms. Learning this Charm converts all known Combos into experience points and prevents the character from developing Combos.</description>

      <description>Ebon Dragon Pantheon Unfurling: By paying 100 motes per dot of permanent Essence (capped at 9 for non-fetiches), the Ebon Dragon spawns a Third Circle soul with full motes. If he lacks a fetich, he is irresistibly compelled to spawn one as soon as he can pay the cost. If his fetich is destroyed, the Ebon Dragon ceases to exist except as an Essence pool that can't be interacted with, imploding all component souls into himself. He recovers motes until he has enough to create a new fetich, redefining himself as a new Yozi with similar Storyteller-defined themes. If a Green Sun Prince knows any of his Charms, the new Yozi remains equally powerful; otherwise, diminishment is likely. He can't possess more than (Willpower + highest Virtue) Third Circle souls beyond his fetich, lacking Charms to grow via Progenitive souls as many other Yozis do. He can possess his souls (or demons descended from them) as explained in The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V - The Roll of Glorious Divinity II and can telepathically communicate with such beings across all distance and realms of existence (information exchange only; no social attacks). Influence is two-way, however, as the dragon has an Intimacy of dedication to each of the current Motivations of every Third Circle soul that cannot be removed or altered by any means save altering the Motivations of the demons in question.</description>

He also remembers the comprehensive memories of everyone who has ever learned this Charm. Such conceptual purity also confers immunity to undesired Shaping effects, though this protection temporarily abates while he has spent all Willpower points or has no motes remaining. Even the most powerful Shaping attacks such as Soul Mastery and Pattern Spider Touch cannot penetrate this perfect defense. Upon learning this Charm, a character converts all Attributes, Abilities and specialties into experience points (four experience for the first Attribute dot) and can no longer learn such traits.</description>

His intrinsic cowardice prevents him from parrying physical attacks as other Yozis can. He gains three attack options as noted here, manifesting them in any way appropriate to his themes. A strike may be a tail swipe or bite as a dragon, or a weapon he conjures while appearing humanoid. His blast may be an arrow shot from a sum-moned bow or a miasma of killing hate he breathes. Normally, he cannot attack except in accordance with Ebon Dragon Glory Incarnate. If he steals traits using Puissance Mimicry Intuition, he may use those traits to attack at will, with an Accuracy of (Dexterity + [Melee or Martial Arts]) for close combat and (Dexterity + [Archery or Thrown]) for ranged combat.</description>

         A cunning warlock may discover this useful trick somewhere between the Ebon Dragon's manic struggle for freedom and Adorjan's temporary dis-missal of those tools that encumber her. Drawing in a quick breath, the Infernal flares his Essence out in a red-black shockwave that rips his armor from his body and tears it into fluttering strips of Essence. These intangible wisps collapse into a pair of otherworldly black flames, which float just above the warlock's shoulders for the duration of the Charm. Mechanically, Scale-Shedding Solution allows the Infernal to reflexively remove any armor he may be wearing, even armor created by Charms or sorcery. The armor immediately reappears on the Exalt's body when the Charm is terminated by either the end of the scene or countermagic.
         At Essence 6+, this Charm becomes immune to Emerald Countermagic from any source other than the warlock himself, requiring Sapphire Counter-magic or better to cancel it.

         A Green Sun Prince has only to breathe to assert absolute authority over her existence. This Charm provides protection against all unwanted Shaping effects. It creates an invisible Essence shield with (Integrity) layers, which act as health levels; whenever the character is subject to a Shaping effect, she rolls her (Essence + Willpower) against a difficulty of her opponent's Essence. The Storyteller determines the difficulty to resist Shaping not originating with another character, using the Wyld resistance chart on page 140 of The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II - The Wyld as a guideline. If she fails, her shield loses a layer; if she botches, all layers are lost and the Charm terminates. In either case, the Shaping fails to take effect and the warlock has the option of reflexively reactivating Emerald Angel Unfurling by repaying the activation cost. This does not count as a Charm activation.
         Whenever the Infernal experiences any Shaping effect while using this Charm, her anima briefly flares into a mandala of emerald wings in number equal to her Integrity, making Emerald Angel Unfurling momentarily Obvious to observers. If she succeeds on the (Essence + Willpower) roll, the mandala simply fades. If her shield loses a layer, one of the wings develops a crack and falls to pieces before the mandala fades; if she botches the roll, the entire mandala shatters like a pane of glass.
         At Essence 4+, the warlock's shield may not be tested by the pressures of  Pure Chaos more than once per hour, and a break in her shield may not impose this roll anew on further activations of Emerald Angel Unfurling.

         Proving that he is more than merely a gestalt of insane, defeated Primordials, the Infernal sweeps together the broken shards of enlightenment from several Reclamation conspirators and forges them into a new legend all his own. The shinma shudder as a new titan is born: The Infernal is immortal, and needs no longer fear death from age. In declaring his own legend, he may never learn (Yozi) Cosmic Principle (see The Return of the Scarlet Empress, p. 209).
         This Charm conveys one final benefit: The Infernal's player and Storyteller may work together to design a personal analog to First (Yozi) Excellency suited to the personality, themes and obsessions of the character, using the Excellencies of the Yozis as a guideline, as well as a personalized suite of the General Charms found in The Manual of Exalted Power: The Infernals and this book, which are all purchased as Favored Charms.
         This Charm's prerequisites must come from at least two different Yozis. Upon learning this Charm, the Infernal may choose to cannibalize any General Yozi Charms he already knows, converting them into experience which he may spend to instantly replace them with equivalents created through Triumphant Howl of the Devil-Tiger. Charms requiring lost Excellencies as prerequisites (save for this Charm) are also converted into experience.

         This complex trick requires an understanding of defiance and escape culled from not one, but two of the Reclamation conspirators. For those who would develop this heretical technique, its extravagant cost is a small concern. The act of learning this Charm is a Blasphemy.
         In addition to causing the usual chaos in Heaven, the Yozis are immediately alerted that something is wrong by Lillun's agonized howl. Concentrating his Exaltation into a savage, cutting edge, the Infernal severs the metaphysical umbilicus connecting it to the phylactery-womb of the Yozis. In the process, the indestructible Essence core of the Exaltation reconfigures itself for independent survival. Upon the Green Sun Prince's death, his Exaltation will fly away rather than returning to Malfeas, seeking out a free, unbound First Circle demon somewhere in Creation. Embedding itself in the unsuspecting creature, the Exaltation overrides the demon's mind as an irresistible Total Control effect. The demon is forced to carry the Exaltation to a properly heroic host, where it carries out the usual bargain; acceptance triggers the beginning of the Chrysalis Grotesque, as normal. The only difference between this and standard Infernal Exaltation is that the Yozis are incapable of observing or influencing the process, or even of exercising their normal prerogative to possess the hijacked demon. The task of locating and recapturing the Exaltation and reattaching its umbilicus is left as an exercise in ingenuity for the enraged lords of Hell.
         The warlock also enjoys a +1 MDV bonus against Yozi and demon Charms, which does not count as a bonus added by a Charm.

         The warlock must retreat from the world to learn this Charm. For one season, she must surround herself only with those things which are steeped in her Essence - her attuned artifacts, her bound demons and nothing more. Concentrating inward, she drives the enormous power of the conflicting forces she has mastered against one another, with her Essence caught between them. Much as the Yozis reconfigure their akuma, she redefines the parameters of her mutilated Exaltation, crafting something more to her liking.
         Upon learning this Charm, the warlock partially redesigns her Caste. Her iconic anima display changes to become representative of herself rather than her unwoven coadjutor, in the manner of the Solar Exalted (though its predominating imagery is still that of Hell, not the glorious heroes of the sun). Her anima banner itself may be radically transformed, having different cosmetic effects on objects exposed to it; it may even shine some color other than green (though it will never identically mimic the anima display of some other variety of Exalted). She designs a new caste mark for herself.
         Moreover, she discards her old anima power, replacing it with a new one designed by her player and the Storyteller and matched to the character's personal aptitudes and talents. Use existing anima powers as a creation guideline.
         These transformations are permanent for the warlock, but not extensive enough to endure into her next incarnation. Her Exaltation restores itself to the base template mandated by the Yozis upon death. All changes brought about by this Charm must be approved by the Storyteller.

         Learning this Charm requires a shorter but far more dangerous retreat into hermitage than its prerequisite. When she begins developing this Charm, the warlock weaves an Essence-forged cocoon around herself, where she will remain for the normal training time required to learn it. During her time in this new Chrysalis Grotesque, she gains a soak of 30L/30B and a Hardness of 15L/15B, but remains Inactive for the entire duration.
         Upon emerging, the warlock enjoys the benefits of a transformation far more radical than her last. She dissolves her Caste entirely, forging a new Caste suited to her personal nature. She retains her original patron Yozi as a second Favored Yozi, and becomes capable of designing an entirely new set of Charms reflecting her own Essence, nature, and power, which are purchased as Favored Charms. The Charm cascades of the Yozis should be used as an example of what is appropriate for this new Charm tree (the majority of its Charms exist in the Essence 2-3 range, all perfect defenses share a single customized Imperfection, and so forth).
         While the Infernal does not change her current Caste and Favored Abilities, she notionally designates five Abilities from among that set as the new Abilities of "her" Caste. Her next incarnation treats these as Caste Abilities, rather than the Caste Abilities the Exaltation previously harbored.
         All changes to the Exalt made by this Charm as well as those produced by The Tempest of Inward Focus are now permanent, carrying on into future incarnations (although the specific presentation of future iconic animas will vary from incarnation to incarnation), barring alteration of her Exaltation.
         Learning this Charm is a Blasphemy. All of existence feels the warlock's ascension.

         The warlock smiles or sobs, whichever may be appropriate to her transcendence, as the chains of the Yozis fall from her heart. She weaves a final Chrysalis Grotesque, which functions identically to that of this Charm's prerequisite. Upon emerging, she subsumes her Unwoven Coadjutor, subtly reconfiguring her appearance to more directly express her own Infernal nature rather than that of a mere serf of the First Circle. More importantly, the warlock redefines her own Urge so that it permanently matches her Motivation.
         The reins of Torment may be taken out of the hands of the Yozis, but they do not disappear altogether. The Infernal must define her own new Torment manifestation, using published Torments as a guideline. She continues to accumulate and reduce Limit in the normal manner; acting against the dictates of her own nature guides the Exalt's hellish Essence to viciously lash out against her.

         Through the power of her Exaltation, the Infernal carves out a world from the substance of her own soul. This Charm permits the Infernal to create a world, piece by piece, as though with Constructive Convergence of Principles (including the requisite mote cost and roll to expand and modify that world). This does not count as a Charm use, but the Infernal must remain in a meditative trance while altering or expanding her inner world. She may not create demesnes or magical things within herself, and her creations do not unravel if they do not interact with Creation. The Infernal's soul is treated as Pure Chaos for this purpose.
         This created world exists wholly within the Infernal's soul, but is otherwise a real, ongoing, self-contained place, which continues to exist even when she is not paying attention to it. The internal worlds of the Infernal Exalted are strange, uncanny places - glassy citadels floating atop clouds in a brazen sky; a massive upside-down fortress hanging above a forest of ivory trees surrounding a still, emerald lake; or a city of cyclopean basalt towers beneath a jetblack sky in which a single red eye hangs and stares. The world the Infernal forges should be consistent with the mood and themes of the Excellency she created through Triumphant Howl of the Devil-Tiger, at the Storyteller's discretion.
         The Infernal may mentally visit this world by taking a miscellaneous action (Speed 5 long ticks, DV -3) to enter an Inactive meditative state, always appearing at the center of the first part of the world she shaped into being. She may leave this trance at any time with a Speed 5, DV -2 miscellaneous action. Individuals created in her inner world do not have souls of their own and cannot grant her Essence through prayer, though they are otherwise real to her while she is there (for instance, she might copy such a person with Black Mirror Shintai, and any damage suffered manifests on her physical body). The Infernal cannot yet travel physically into this world, bring anything from the outer world into it, or bring anything from the inner world out. These feats require additional Charms.

      <description>It is the nature of nascent titans to indulge themselves. The warlock's player designs a type of custom Act of Villainy called a Precipitous Fiat. These Fiats are unique to the transcendent Infernal who invents them, but are otherwise identical to Acts, and must substantially endanger or inconvenience the character. When the Infernal loses Limit through this Fiat, she is able to inflict one point of Limit on a Yozi of her choice whose Charms are open to her.</description>

         Externalizing her cosmic might, the Infernal weaves a free-standing Chrysalis Grotesque out of thin air, which incubates a pulsating and unformed Essence core. (The Chrysalis has the same traits as in The Flame of the Rising Phoenix; it is destroyed if it suffers a single health level of damage.) Within the Chrysalis sleeps an inchoate demon of the Third Circle (which should be designed by the Infernal's player working together with the Storyteller). The Chrysalis will hatch and disgorge this demon once the Infernal has fed it (demon's desired Essence rating x 100) motes, to a maximum of Essence 9. It may absorb up to five motes per day. The demon, once born, forms seven Second Circle devas for itself, as normal.
         This Charm cannot form a fetich soul for the Infernal; being possessed of a soul of her own, the warlock is above such weaknesses. Although demons created with this Charm are not obligated to obey their creator, they have significant incentive to protect her, as they will die if she does. As well, the created spirit has an Intimacy of loyalty toward the Infernal which may never be removed. This influence is mutual; the Infernal gains an Intimacy toward the demon's Motivation, which may not be removed while the demon lives. Demons created through this Charm act as an arcane link to their creator. They are immune to sorcerous summons, though not to banishment. If the Infernal knows The Spirit of the Living World, banished demons are trapped inside the Infernal's soul for five days rather than being sent to Hell.
         The Infernal may have up to (Willpower + Compassion) Third Circle demons created by this Charm in existence at a time.

         Having forged external souls from her cosmic power and enlightenment, the Infernal sends them into the world. But the warlock knows that a crane is just as beautiful when land-bound by a broken wing, and so she ensures that her new devas may not stray too far.
         This Charm allows the Infernal to possess her souls (or demons descended from them) (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V - The Roll of Glorious Divininity II, p. 15) and to telepathically communicate with them across all distance and realms of existence (information exchange only; no social attacks). She may also pay one point of Willpower to issue a mandate of subordination against her souls (see Exalted, p. 295 and The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV - The Roll of Glorious Divinity I, p. 169).

         Achieving apotheosis, the Infernal may pass on her enlightenment to the willing. One of the  Infernal's Third Circle demons, of her choosing, learns the Charm Investiture of Infernal Glory (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Infernals, page 52-54). Exalted akuma created through such Investiture gain access to the Charms innovated through Triumphant Howl of the Devil-Tiger and The Flame of the Rising Phoenix.
         If the demon so blessed is ever slain, the Infernal may reassign this power to another of her souls at no cost once five Calibrations have passed (or sooner as a reflexive action costing one point of permanent Willpower).

      <description>Where Adorjan blows, few can run fast or far enough to escape her touch. This Charm permanently enhances an Infernal's Dash actions (see Exalted, p. 143). First, dashing carries a DV penalty of -0. Second, the character automatically succeeds in crossing treacherous terrain without needing a roll. Finally, the Exalt adds his Essence rating to his Dexterity for the purposes of calculating his base dashing speed and does not subtract wound penalties from this calculation. These benefits apply equally to running and other means of locomotion encompassed by a dash action, such as climbing or swimming. Other effects that increase the Exalt's speed use the Wind-Born Stride-enhanced value as the Infernal's natural base speed before applying their modifiers. This Charm may be purchased a maximum number of times equal to the Exalt's Essence rating, with each purchase stacking to cumulatively increase dashing speed. The other benefits of the Charm do not improve with repurchase.</description>

         The Infernal waltzes and pirouettes through sky-darkening tempests of arrows, untouched and seemingly oblivious to their passage. This Charm reduces the cost to use Who Strikes the Wind? against a ranged attack by one mote, provided the Exalt is moving toward the attacker. The Charm applies a second discount of one mote against the attacks of extras. With Essence 4+, a third one-mote discount applies against attacks by mortals or natural animals. These discounts stack, but even a free perfect defense still requires a Charm activation.
         As a final effect of this Charm, the Infernal understands that speed is relative. His speed is considered no less than that of an attacker who is moving toward him for the purposes of applying the Imperfection of the Silent Wind to any Charms.

         In the moment that Adorjan chooses not to be struck, she is not. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm activates Who Strikes The Wind?, she may pay six motes rather than the usual cost, allowing her to perfectly dodge all attacks against her for one tick rather than separately activating the Charm against each individual attack. The Imperfection of the Silent Wind still applies, so the Infernal must still move at sufficient speed.
         Infernals with Essence 5+ who have activated the Charm Opened Eye of the Hurricane (see page 141-142) may extend the duration of perfect dodging from one tick to one action by spending six motes and one Willpower instead of six motes. Only when the character's DV refreshes does the aegis of perfect movement abate.

      <description>Nothing fills Adorjan's heart with childlike glee like the prospect of a massacre. This Charm enhances a Join Battle roll, adding one bonus success per mote spent, up to (lower of Dexterity or Wits rating) successes, as well as additional successes equal to the number of times the Infernal has purchased Wind-Born Stride. As a final benefit, the Infernal regains one Willpower from elation the first time she uses this Charm in a given scene, or two Willpower if she joined battle while participating in social combat. The Charm provides no Willpower if another character initiates hostilities against the Exalt or she interjects herself into an ongoing battle. She must start the fight.</description>

      <description>There is stillness. And then storm. This Charm is a magical flurry composed of any Attribute- and/or Ability-based actions besides ranged attacks. The flurry is not limited to a fixed number of actions, nor does it suffer usual multiple action penalties. Instead, each action after the first suffers a cumulative -1 penalty (-1 on the second, -2 on the third, etc.). If this penalty matches or exceeds the base dice pool it penalizes before applying any modifiers, that action can't be attempted. Normal rate limits apply to attacks within this flurry, with normally infinite rate weapons reduced to base Rate 5 before adding in any rate bonuses. The DV penalty for the entire flurry is the greatest penalty among component actions (or -0 if the Infernal has Essence 4+). Although a flurry granted by this Charm involves a finite number of attacks, each attack can represent dozens or even hundreds of lightning fast strikes whose cumulative effect is equivalent to fewer, better-defined blows.</description>

         In all of Malfeas, among all races of demons spawned of every Yozi, one prayer unites the best and worst of Hell in common terror: "May the peace of Adorjan not fall upon me". Their desperate pleas are prayers to her, empowering her to bestow her unique instructive kindness upon them. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal's body achieves ascetic transcendence as it dissolves like eroded stone. In the blink of an eye, the Exalt appears as a gust of crimson-hued wind swirling with mirage distortions. When initially still, he coalesces into a humanoid shape hinting at his material form. As he moves, his ephemeral substance warps and stretches behind him as amorphous streamers of light and pain, making it impossible to identify him without the aid of Charms.
         Scarlet Rapture Shintai provides an Instant duration magical flurry on the tick in which it is used. This flurry contains two actions that suffer no multiple action penalties, ignore weapon Rate and impose a total DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for either action. This flurry may not include ranged attacks. In the exact instant that the Infernal acts, his wind body takes on humanoid semblance to perform that action and exerts force as though solid. Attacks made against him while he exists as wind injure him normally, inflicting wounds in the form of violent disruptions to his component gusts.
         Each activation of Scarlet Rapture Shintai permits a dynamic Combo with any single Charm that could be placed in a normal Combo with it. Dynamic Combos still require one Willpower to activate and always display special effects like a normal Combo, though the exact manifestation can vary with each use.
         Scarlet Rapture Shintai normally costs 12 motes and one Willpower to activate, but only three motes if the character activated it on his last action tick. This Essence is committed only for the Duration of the Charm. Constant reactivation keeps the Infernal's identity obscured by wind form; the character does not change back to normal between activations.
         A second purchase of this Charm requires Essence 5+, increasing the total number of actions in the flurry and the number of Charms that may be contained in a dynamic Combo to three instead of two. A third and final purchase at Essence 6+ raises this to four, the inauspicious count of Adorjan's daughters, the numerology of balanced Virtue and the number of secret truths she must teach Creation before The End.

            In all of Malfeas, among all races of demons spawned of every Yozi, one prayer unites the best and worst of Hell in common terror: "May the peace of Adorjan not fall upon me". Their desperate pleas are prayers to her, empowering her to bestow her unique instructive kindness upon them. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal's body achieves ascetic transcendence as it dissolves like eroded stone. In the blink of an eye, the Exalt reappears as a crimson-hued gale swirling with mirage distortions, before coalescing into a perfect rendition of herself, sculpted from violent, blood-hued winds. This form confers the following benefits:
            • A silent wind swirls around the Infernal, a killing cyclone with only her in its eye. This wind is identical to the destructive aura of Pellegrina's Fury, but with a range of (Essence x 50) yards. All benefits of Wind-Daughter's Wrath that the warlock has access to also apply to this effect. Mass units are especially vulnerable to this wind, doubling the damage they take each tick and the mote cost their commander must pay to protect them.
            • As a creature of living, semi-solid wind, she is immune to mundane attacks, and reduces magical attacks against her to minimum damage. Attacks that have no physical component or that have an area of effect bypass this protection. Any equipment she carries takes on the same wind-like nature, allowing her to use it normally.
            • She cannot be affected by clinches or Blockade Movement actions unless they use magic that could reasonably constrain the wind itself, nor can she take such actions herself. Any Poison, Sickness, or Crippling that could not reasonably affect a being whose body is living wind cannot affect her.
            • She adds her (Essence + sum of all Virtues) to her dashing speed. She must move at her maximum dash speed on each tick or this Charm ends.

      <description>Danger is fun, and fun should be savored. So it is that Adorjan's perception of time slows to a crawl when she detects immanent threats. This Charm may be activated in response to any potential threat within range of the Infernal's senses, ensuring perfect detection of that threat. Against an unexpected attack, this Charm also removes that label, allowing the Exalt to defend normally. Although the Infernal's player chooses when to activate this Charm based on declarations of opposing attacks or other dangers, the character experiences the Charm as an instinct over which she has no conscious control.</description>

      <description>Many oppose Adorjan. Their opposition is prayer to her, so her miracles answer their thoughtful worship. While this Charm is active, all penalties to Dodge DV that the Infernal would suffer from coordinated attacks or onslaught become equivalent Dodge DV bonuses instead. In Mass Combat, this Charm negates all advantages conferred by higher Magnitude for units attacking the Infernal while he fights as a solo unit. If a tick goes by where the character fails to traverse the minimum distance covered by a Move action, the Charm temporarily loses all effects but remains active. Moving appropriately for a tick reasserts the protection on the following tick.</description>

      <description>The enemies of Adorjan must concentrate if they hope to see her blindingly fast strikes in time to defend against them. This Charm may enhance any close-combat attack against a single opponent, regardless of the Ability used for the attack. The enhanced attack becomes unexpected unless the target spends one Willpower to concentrate on defense at the critical moment. Spending Willpower this way isn't considered resisting mental influence. Extras may not spend Willpower this way. This Charm may benefit only one action in a flurry.</description>

            The warlock strikes with the blinding speed of the Silent Wind, landing savage blows before her victim can even react. An attack supplemented by this Charm halves any DV applied against it, and counts extra successes on the attack roll twice for calculating its raw damage. She can only use this Charm if she dashed at least up to her full Dash speed before making the attack.
            A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ allows the Infernal to pay an additional seven motes to make the supplemented attack unblockable and undodgeable.

         Adorjan's daughter, the Brilliant Wind, sometimes imagines she can outpace her mother. In the end, she merely outpaces her mother's madness. This Charm may only be activated on the Infernal's action tick and no more than once per tick. As Racing Vitaris activates, the Exalt launches forward at superhuman acceleration, trailing strobe-flicker afterimages tinted in the colors of the Exalt's anima. This display obviates Stealth like an eight to ten mote anima banner. Everyone without supernatural balance standing within five yards of the Infernal's initial position must check for knockdown at a difficulty of the Exalt's Essence rating. This Charm triples the Exalt's base movement rate for its duration. However, the character must maintain maximum dashing speed or the Charm terminates. Racing Vitaris may be reactivated to release another shockwave.
         At Essence 4+, activation of this Charm releases a flash of light in addition to a burst of force. Mortals within 100 yards with a clear line of sight to the acceleration are automatically blinded until the Infernal's next action tick, though characters who prepare by closing their eyes in advance are immune. With Essence 5, the light gains the power to temporarily blind magical beings as thought they were mortals, though any whose players succeed at a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll at difficulty 3 can look away in time to avoid blinding. Essence 6+ worsens matters for mortals and animals, permanently blinding them as a Crippling effect. Heroic mortals can make a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll at difficulty 5 to look away and suffer momentary blindness rather than permanent loss of sight. This flash of light is not optional, nor does it differentiate friend from foe.

      <description>The Grinding Wind destroys all stone she touches, avenging an ancient slight against her mother by Pasiap during the Time of Glory. Upon activating this Charm, the character's anima banner swells to the 11 to 15 mote level and remains so for its duration. More importantly, all stones and nonmagical objects predominantly made of stones suffer one level of lethal damage per tick that they remain within a radius of (Essence) yards, with damage manifesting as accelerated wind erosion. A stone floor will still support the character's weight while her power grinds it away, at least until that segment is actually destroyed.</description>

         Lesser beings may run for a time and falter. They do not internalize the motion until it uplifts and rejuvenates them. Infernals with this Charm experience no fatigue while dashing. Any existing fatigue penalties from prior exertions abate for the duration, returning without improvement when the character stops dashing. At Essence 3+, the act of continuously dashing counts as rest for the purposes of alleviating fatigue. At Essence 4+, prolonged dashing also counts as meditation for the purpose of Essence recovery.
         Reaching Essence 5+ initiates a more extreme metamorphosis, as continuous dashing counts as sleep for all recuperative purposes, including the opportunity for a Willpower recovery roll every eight hours. The Infernal even dreams while dashing, though this reflexively occurs on a separate level of consciousness and does not impair conscious actions. The character loses all recuperative benefits from actual sleep.
         A second purchase of this Charm expands its scope to include any form of continuous and normally fatiguing exertion in addition to dashing. The exertion must involve significant non-stationary movement. Gentle lovemaking would not suffice, though a wild romp spilling from room to room would.

         Adorjan does not kill because she enjoys the pain of others, but because it is natural for her to do so. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm takes a single action that kills one or more natural animals no smaller than herself or thinking beings of any size, she reflexively respires one mote per victim (up to five motes per action). The murderous act also physically nourishes her for one day. The character never becomes too full regardless of how many meals of violence she savors. She only receives these rewards after she turns her back on the remains of her victims or the site of their deaths and moves away. Attaining higher Essence extends the duration of satiation provided by each feast of violence: one week (Essence 4) or one year (Essence 5+).
         If the Infernal has Compassion 3+, she no longer needs to fail a roll or spend Willpower to harm mortals in ways that violate Compassion. Such beings are beneath her, and their pain does not trouble her. Conversely, the Infernal can't channel Compassion to aid mortals. The sufferings of fellow Essence users compel her heart normally and may prompt her to channel Compassion to help them.

      <description>Does the wind stumble? While the Infernal dashes, she automatically maintains balance and exerts no weight on solid objects, allowing her to skip from one blade of grass to another or waltz across the snow without leaving footprints. This weightless grace adds the lower of the Infernal's (Dexterity and Athletics) to the difficulty of all efforts to track her and ensures quiet passage, providing a temporary +3 Stealth specialty in "Moving Silently" that does not stack with other specialties.</description>

         Adorjan darts over rivers of blood without sinking into them. She is above wallowing in gore, so this Charm further enhances the functional weightlessness afforded by its prerequisite to cover liquid surfaces. If the Infernal begins a dash while swimming on the surface, she may continue to swim or nimbly climb atop the liquid and run on it. If she continues to swim, she dashes at the same speed as if running.
         Additionally, the Exalt suffers no environmental harm associated with any dangerous conditions she traverses. This immunity does not defend against environmental hazards that aren't associated with the surface she dashes on or through. With Essence 4+, she is immune to all environmental hazards and penalties while dashing, even those unrelated to the medium of her journey.

         Adorjan often flies low to the ground, the better to ravage her prey. Bloody-hued winds swirl around the Infernal in an eerily silent vortex, bearing him aloft to a maximum height of (Athletics rating) yards off the ground. The vortex obviates Stealth like an eight to ten mote anima banner. The Exalt can hover, fly and otherwise move without regard for gravity so long as he observes this limited flight ceiling, flitting along at his normal ground speed. The altitude limit merely requires that he remain close to a solid or liquid surface, so the Charm can be used to fly up the side of a wall or glide over a river. Losing consciousness terminates the Charm.
         If the character ever finds himself with more distance separating him from an acceptable surface, he falls normally until he is back within the normal limit of the ground, at which point he slows to a quick stop without suffering harm.
         A second purchase requires Essence 4+ but removes the flight ceiling entirely. A third purchase at Essence 5+ extends the Charm's duration to Indefinite and reduces the cost to (10 - Essence rating) motes.

         The wind is felt, not seen. So long as he maintains maximum dashing speed, the Infernal is invisible and as inaudible as desired. This state imposes a -2 external penalty on all attempts to notice or attack him and provides two bonus successes on contested Stealth rolls, but these benefits do not stack with each other. Ranged attacks against the Exalt automatically miss without aid of a Charm or stunt.
         Efforts to track the Infernal automatically fail. If a perfect tracking effect contests this effect, add the Infernal's Essence rating in automatic successes to the opposed roll.

         The ragged gasps of the Silent Wind inhale promises, endings and sometimes worlds. This Charm may be activated only while the Infernal moves away from a target corpse or corpses that he is aware of within (Essence x 10) yards. The corpse dissolves into the wind like stone eroded by the gales of uncounted eons. Possessions do not deteriorate. Even as its mass ceases to be, the universe maintains harmonious equilibrium by the spontaneous generation and inhalation of Essence-infused breath within the body of the Infernal.
         Drawing this breath assures the character can breathe safely in all climates and conditions for a number of hours equal to the corpses inhaled. If the Infernal inhales a corpse he personally killed, he gains mystical ownership of all objects on the victim's person left behind when the cadaver ceased to exist. Items that the deceased did not own at the time of death remain the possessions of their rightful owner. This Charm cannot dissolve corpses that have been imbued with animation of any sort.
         This Charm grows in power with the Infernals who master it. At Essence 3+, the air provided by each corpse inhalation increases from one hour to one day. Essence 5+ confers the power to inhale (and thus annihilate) animate corpse extras. This automatically ejects any possessing beings. With Essence 7+, non-extra walking dead may be inhaled, though necromantic war machines notably larger than a single human remain off limits.

         A pariah among her siblings, Adorjan no longer hates the Exalted who defeated and imprisoned her. She has found deeper freedom in her confinement by flaying away the burdens of her heart, scouring true love and vengeful bitterness alike. Even as Malfeas crushes himself with brooding layers of rage, Adorjan flies free and perversely innocent. It is for her unthinkable acceptance of her state that the other Yozis find her disturbing, not her tendency to impose casual genocide on their children. This Charm immediately terminates an Infernal's emotional attachment to an Intimacy, removing it. If the focus of attachment is present, the Infernal must physically turn her back on that object or individual and begin walking away as part of activating this Charm. Intimacies beyond the character's senses may be terminated the same way, save that the character silently mouths the name of the subject and reminisces a moment before putting the feelings out of mind. By emptying her heart of individual ties, the Exalt gives herself room to develop her empathy more abstractly, regaining one spent Compassion channel the first time she uses this Charm each scene.
         Whenever the Exalt cuts away attachment toward a character, she also cancels any ongoing Emotion effects imposed on her by that character. She may also choose to delete all of her memories pertaining to that character. Deleted memories leave the Infernal with knowledge of past experiences involving the offending character, but she misattributes or misremembers events and deeds specific to that character.

      <description>Sometimes, Adorjan falls in love. Her hate is safer. The Infernal gains an Intimacy of sincere love toward another individual, be it amorous or purely platonic. So long as the Intimacy lasts, the character adds successes instead of dice when channeling Compassion to aid the subject of the Intimacy. Additionally, any stunt that teaches, hurts or expresses affection toward that subject adds one to its rating as though it resonated with the Exalt's Motivation. If the Infernal gains one Willpower from succeeding with such a stunt, she may forgo that award to regain one Compassion channel instead. Finally, the Exalt subtracts her Compassion rating from the MDV of the subject whenever socially attacking her. Tragic Love Amusement can't create any new Intimacies once the Infernal maintains this type of enchanted love toward (Compassion) individuals.</description>

         The wind travels light. Her only possessions are extensions of herself. The Infernal makes a mock attack at the air using a close combat weapon she owns. That weapon fades into the wind and disperses through Elsewhere, thereafter existing only as a vague potential for violence. Up to (Essence) weapons may be banished this way with separate Charm activations. Whenever the Exalt has the necessary hand(s) available to hold a banished weapon or matched pair and wishes to make an attack using that selection, she may reflexively pay one mote to summon it to her hand. Summoned weapons shimmer into existence wreathed in a flicker of bloody lightning, fading back into Elsewhere just as quickly after striking. If wielded for a flurry, weapons last for the entire flurry or until dismissed in favor of another summoned weapon, rather than costing one mote for each attack.
         Appropriate countermagic targeting the Infernal's hands recalls all banished weapons, though they simply fall around her rather than usefully landing in her grip. Although weapons banished this way are almost impossible to disarm, they are also useless for parrying anything besides counterattacks. Once an Infernal has Essence 5+, banished weapons cost nothing to summon for an attack, though she can still only summon and wield one such weapon per attack.

      <description>Adorjan pities her siblings. They plot vengeance against the gods and their Chosen so seriously that they fail to see the absurd humor in hairless monkey creatures rising up and conquering the creators of the universe. What could be funnier than that? This Charm may be activated for one mote in response to any sort of mental influence, causing that influence to become Obvious to the Infernal's senses. He may then allow the effect to go forward without opposition or spend an additional four motes to perfectly parry it with inappropriate or unnerving laughter. The Charm can parry unblockable mental influence. The additional mote surcharge is waived if the character has made no other vocal utterances previously in the scene.</description>

      <description>Adorjan is among the most virtuous of Yozis and the most wicked. For her, the two states are one and the same. It is the nature of the Silent Wind to torment the pure and the vile alike to remind all beings how unimportant and helpless they are in the face of all she represents. Whenever the Infernal observes an enemy channel a Virtue, he intuitively recognizes the fact and can reflexively spend one Willlpower to regain a channel of the balancing Virtue (Compassion for witnessing Conviction, Valor yields Temperance, and vice versa). Virtue channeling by neutral or friendly characters offers nothing to breathe in. If multiple Infernals attempt to respire the same Virtue channel, use a standard roll off to determine who wins.</description>

         As the embodiment of silence, Adorjan senses her antithesis with unparalleled sensitivity. This Charm permanently upgrades the Infernal's sense of hearing to levels comparable to simultaneous use of Keen Hearing and Touch Technique and Unsurpassed Hearing and Touch Discipline (see Exalted, page 225-226), save that only hearing improves and not touch. This acuity comes at a price, however, as the character finds sound painful. While the Exalt can hear any sounds louder than a whisper, he suffers a -1 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions. This penalty rises to -2 while subjected to noises of comparable volume to shouting. Such loud noises also impose an unnatural Compulsion to impose corrective silence by any means necessary, starting with the loudest noise and working down from there. The character can't take non-reflexive actions unrelated to imposing quiet until this goal is complete, but actions serving the Compulsion are not penalized.
         The Infernal may ignore all penalties and tune out the Charm's Compulsion for one scene while retaining all of the magic's advantages for one Willpower. Fortunately for those mad enough to befriend students of Adorjan, Infernals with Hateful Wretched Noise can tolerate noises up to normal speaking volume from known allies with only a -1 penalty and no Compulsion. Anything louder arouses the usual ire of the Silent Wind.

         The Infernal swallows her voice, consuming that which is most antithetical to blessed quiet. She loses the ability to make any vocal utterances except laughter, but the sacrifice purifies her words and gives them nobler means of expression. The mental voice granted by this Charm can address a specific Intelligence 1+ being the Infernal can perceive within 100 yards, or it can broadcast to all such minds within the radius. Recipients hear the Infernal's voice within their mind and recognize that the telepathic speech comes from a nonspecific external source, though those who have heard the Exalt speak will recognize the same inflections. This form of communication can't be overheard without magic dedicated to the purpose. The Charm may communicate only in Old Realm, and is useless to those who cannot speak it.
         Characters who wish to tune out all transmissions from every activation of this Charm may do so for a day by spending one Willpower. This is considered resisting unnatural mental influence. If an Infernal has any Virtues rated at 5 dots, listeners with the same rating in that Virtue can understand the key nuances of the Exalt's words enough to derive meaningful comprehension without knowing Old Realm. This Charm lasts until the Exalt reactivates it.

         Noise alone drives Adorjan to monstrous killing rage. Lies bring out her righteousness, which is infinitely worse. This Charm is a counterattack against any form of mental influence based on deception. It does not lessen the effectiveness of the opposing mental influence, instead forcing the attacker to believe his lies. Roll the Infernal's (Charisma + Presence + Essence) against the attacker's Dodge MDV. Success convinces the target of whatever delusion he sought to impose on the Infernal. Resisting this unnatural Illusion to recognize the truth for a scene costs two Willpower. When retaliating against magical Illusions that have different resistance guidelines, these guidelines apply to the Exalt, while the attacker resists according to the rules for Dissonant Lies Made True.
         Victims may only resist reflected lies when confronted with some external evidence of the deception. Those trapped within their own mind or bound by an inescapable or perfect lie may apply deeper introspection to the same result. Once a victim of this Charm has spent a cumulative total of 10 Willpower over five separate scenes or the fixed duration of the attacker's original lie passes (whichever comes first), he permanently slips free of that Illusion.

         The death cry of Lilike, fetich soul of the River of Torments, armed her murderer with a horrid bane against the newly incarnated Adorjan. Accordingly, this Charm may be learned by Solars, Lunars and Sidereals for 16 experience points as though the Chosen were a member of the Eclipse Caste. No teacher is necessary if the character has ever heard the Charm used. Gods and demons who have heard the Charm can teach it, though they can't actually learn it themselves.
         The Demon-Wracking Shout is a cry that exceeds all others, both in volume and in the scope of its anguish. As this Charm activates, a piece of the Exalt's soul tears off and pours from his mouth as a screaming wind that courses over the battlefield like Adorjan herself. Demons within a radius of one mile suffer levels of unsoakable aggravated damage equal to the Exalt's Essence rating. Those killed join the scream, bodies remaining upright and shrieking as bloody streamers of Essence pour from their dead mouths for a heartbeat before the gale disintegrates them. Any First Circle demon who survives suffers an irresistible Compulsion to flee the area and not return for five days. Until then, they treat efforts to make them return as unacceptable orders. Second and Third Circle survivors also feel this Compulsion but may resist by spending five Willpower. Demons descended from Adorjan can't resist regardless of their circle. All beings within the radius suffer deafness as a Crippling effect, though hearing returns to Essence users at the end of the scene. Souls of non-Yozi Primordials caught in the radius suffer as demons do, though souls transformed into non-spirit states of existence like demesnes or artifacts do not.
         Adorjan herself (along with any other who has learned Hateful Wretched Noise) suffers no damage from the Charm, but its Compulsion exorcises her as readily as her progeny. She also suffers an Emotion effect that forces her to instantly develop an Intimacy of love toward the character who dared echo her slain fetich, replacing any existing Intimacy to the character based on another emotional context. Lilike's murderer Marus came to regret the love of Adorjan and vainly sought to earn her hatred until his terrible death. Those who wield this Charm against her must never forget what her love means.

         Bored with racing across the surface of walls, the Silent Wind may blow through them. Sometimes she leaves, finding freedom; at other times she enters, finding victims. To activate this Charm, the Infernal must be dashing at her maximum speed, and must have maintained this velocity throughout her entire previous action. Upon invocation, it allows her to body to shred apart into a crimson wind which blows through the cracks and gaps in a barrier, to reform on the other side. Smears and stains of blood are left behind in the Infernal's wake. This Charm cannot bypass obstacles more than (Essence) yards thick, or which are airtight (so, a door with a keyhole or a space beneath it, or a wooden wall with gaps between the boards would be valid targets, while a solid wall sheathed in marble would not). This Charm automatically allows the Infernal to bypass anyone attempting to physically impede her with a Blockade Movement action (see Glories of the Most High: Luna, p. 22).
         At Essence 4+, Unbound Freedom Infiltration may be invoked as an innate power rather than a Charm activation by paying an extra aggravated health level upon activation.

         Those who have earned Adorjan's deepest regard may be graced with her most sacred gift-silence. This Charm may be invoked to supplement a kiss; if the target is an unwilling recipient of the Infernal's affections, this requires a clinch attempt (the kiss itself may be treated as a hold action if desired, though a crush attack is just as effective; so long as the Infernal draws in her victim's breath, the state of the rest of his body is of little consequence). With a quick inhalation of breath, the Infernal steals her victim's voice. Though not actually damaging, the process is momentarily but excruciatingly painful; coughing up a few drops of blood is a common aftereffect.
         For as long as the Infernal commits Essence to maintain the Charm, she may speak in the voice she has stolen. Releasing the commitment of Essence returns the stolen voice to its proper owner. At Essence 4+, she gains the ability terminate the Charm by swallowing a stolen voice entirely, which nourishes her as if it were a corpse inhaled with Sacred Kamilla's Inhalation (or, optionally, as though it were the death of an extra, if the Infernal knows Murder is Meat). If the voice belonged to a mortal, that mortal is rendered permanently mute. If it belonged to a supernatural being, that being is rendered mute for one week per dot of the Infernal's Essence before finally regaining his voice.
         A second purchase of this Charm, at Essence 4+, gives the Infernal the option to let a stolen voice's owner telepathically hear the words she speaks with it regardless of the distance between them (provided they are in the same realm of existence). This may even be used to make social attacks against the voice's original owner. Shutting the stolen voice out for a day costs one Willpower. This can be done as soon as communication begins to minimize the victim's risk. If a victim doesn't shut out words that turn out to be a social attack, it is too late to block that attack via immunity. The victim must first resolve the social attack before spending an extra Willpower to shut out the stolen voice.

         Demons evacuating ahead of the Silent Wind often congregate in places she recently ravaged, counting on her to seek a new venue of massacre rather than endure the tedium of a familiar arena. They are wise to do so. Adorjan has little patience for tasks that bore her or require her to stay in one place for any length of time and counts on her speed to rush through chores. The base cost to activate this charm is five motes, plus an additional five mote surcharge for each time the Exalt has activated the Charm in the past 25 hours.
         While enchanted by this Charm, the warlock completes all Ability-based actions in half the usual time, provided that those actions normally would take ten minutes or longer to complete. The Charm is not cumulative with other quickening effects; only the best applies. Impatient Tempest Labor also can't quicken the casting of spells. Each dot of Essence above 2 cumulatively halves this time, so an Essence 5 Infernal works at sixteen times normal speed. It is not possible to work at less than maximum speed, given Adorjan's impatience. Not all tasks that can be quickened benefit from doing so; just because a warlock can recite the entire Broken-Winged Crane in the span of a second doesn't mean that a listener can absorb spoken information at that rate. The Charm also doesn't quicken fixed time limits that have nothing to do with how quick the Infernal is, such as cooking time on an alchemical reagent or the maturation of a sired offspring within a pregnant mother (unless the warlock is the pregnant one, since surviving childbirth is a Stamina + Resistance roll for mortals). The Storyteller should use common sense when adjudicating such cases.
         Adorjan struggles to build things that last because of her cultivated aversion to forming attachments. Consequently, the acceleration granted by this Charm may not allow a character to complete more than a day's worth of effort building or repairing items using any Craft Ability in a day. In the aforementioned Essence 5 example capable of completing 16 hours of work per hour, this limitation would allow her to spend a full hour of activation crafting, but slightly into the second hour, she would run against this limit and could not bring herself to "waste" any more time on crafts. She may use the remaining duration of accelerated speed for other tasks in the meantime, but she must wait a day before using the Charm for anything to do with construction or repairs.

         The pets of the Yozis are not so dissimilar to the pets of mortals, save perhaps for the scope of exertions required to keep them happy and healthy. This Charm may enhance any close combat attack that successfully hits a target no greater than triple the warlock's own size. The target must be a single being or object; structures may not be toppled this way. The enhanced attack swats the target away in a direction of the Infernal's choice a distance equaling the number of yards the warlock moved via her own locomotion on the previous tick. If terrain allows, the victim skids to a halt stunned and prone, but suffering no further harm. If deliberately hurled into a solid barrier, the victim suffers dice of damage equal to the distance she would have continued to travel (maximum 25) and then slumps to the ground, stunned and prone. This damage is normally bashing, but may be lethal depending on the composition of the barrier.
         If the Infernal uses this Charm where a Primordial behemoth or natural animal can see her do so, all of her subsequent actions to control, communicate with or train that creature later in the scene are at target number 6 rather than 7. Interactions with other similar beings may enjoy this benefit with Storyteller approval. Unrolled actions are unaffected. This perk doesn't improve if a creature observes multiple activations of this Charm.
         If the Infernal has Essence 3+ and any Primordial behemoths or predatory natural animals observe the Infernal use this Charm to knock away something that they consider edible, the beasts feel an unnatural Compulsion to attack and devour the food source until successful or the scene ends. Resisting this urge costs only one Willpower and may be done at any time, but beasts will normally only resist if they personally know and care about the target as something more than a snack.

         This Charm upgrades its prerequisite, broadening its power to damage all non-magical inanimate objects within range. Adorjan hopes this lesson will one day teach her daughter to think beyond her vendetta and eagerly awaits the day Pellegrina surprises her by blowing away the arrogant metal towers of Malfeas.
         A second purchase of this Charm requires Essence 4+, but broadens its scope further to include animate beings with an Essence rating lower than the warlock. Affected Essence users may pay 1m per tick in lieu of suffering damage, shielding themselves with an ablative layer of exuded power. Mortals and natural animals aren't so lucky and die in a matter of seconds. Effects that minimize or negate environmental damage work normally to mitigate damage/Essence drain from this Charm.
         With Essence 6+, the second purchase allows the Charm to damage beings of equal Essence to the warlock and inflicts aggravated damage instead of lethal to objects and lower Essence beings.

         Adorjan will fill the world with the silence of letting go. She carries out this thankless crusade with stoic perseverance, but her heroism is its own reward. Nothing is so rewarding to Adorjan as the surge of adrenaline that comes from forcing someone to part ways with their love. This Charm grants the warlock an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it accrues two motes each time she attacks a target that is being protected by way of the Defend Other action, so long as the defender harbors a positive Intimacy toward the Infernal's target. This Intimacy must be more than simple respect or admiration; it must have an intimate emotional context such as friendship or love.
         The warlock also gains two offensive motes any time she attacks a Solar or Lunar who is being protected by their mate, regardless of the emotional context of their Intimacies, or lack thereof. The same also applies to Terrestrial Exalted bound by Sworn Brother's Oath (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Dragon-Blooded, p. 122).

         Adorjan knows what it is to feel loss. It is the pang of hunger that fuels her ravenous abattoir winds. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it gains motes under the following circumstances: Any time the Infernal witnesses an opponent slain by another's hand, she gains a single offensive mote per opponent slain. The Silent Wind is driven into ardor when she is denied her sup.
         If the slain victim is an Essence-user, she accrues (Essence / 2, rounded up) motes. The warlock must be rolled into battle to benefit from this Overdrive.

         When one is fast enough to sidestep arrows, catching them is as easy as plucking insects from the air. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm uses Who Strikes The Wind? to defend against a ranged attack, she may either dodge it as normal or apply a perfect parry by swatting the projectile aside with her hand or a close combat weapon. If the character uses an empty hand to block a solid projectile, she catches it and arms herself with it to the best degree possible. This Charm is not compatible with effects that extend the effectiveness of Who Strikes The Wind? past one instant, such as Laughing Gust Denial. The Imperfection of the Silent Wind applies only to the Infernal's movement, not that of any beneficiaries she might protect with a Defend Other action (see Glories of the Most High: Luna, p. 22).
         At Essence 4+, parried projectiles may be caught and "carried" in eddies of wind spinning around the Exalt. Such items may be knocked from their irregular orbit with a successful disarm attack and may be grabbed and wielded by the warlock as if they were stored on her person. More importantly, the warlock can reflexively hurl all captured projectiles into an enemy to enhance a close combat attack, with each item adding one die to the attack roll (up to the normal limits for Charm bonuses) and two to the attack's raw damage. Projectiles exceeding this limit still fly at the target, but to no additional effect. Hurled missiles then drop to the ground, no longer held by Firefly Arrowhead Grip.

         To call Adorjan insane minimizes how alien and frightening she really is. However, the fissures and partitions of her souls offer many opportunities to those who emulate her power. The Exalt's body shimmers and flickers like a mirage and she opens her mouth in a soundless scream of agony. Bloody vapors pour from her mouth in ragged gasps, congealing to form a duplicate of the Infernal's body that comes into existence naked or wearing simple clothes (worth Resources 2 or less). This duplicate is a heroic mortal, but has the same non-magical traits as its creator, including Intimacies, Motivation and memories. It has no destiny to divine and is a creature of darkness, but is too insignificant to be outside fate. Human trait limits apply, capping Attributes and Abilities at 5 dots. The construct begins life with full health, Willpower points equal to (lesser of the Infernal's Willpower or Essence rating) and all Virtue channels.
         The duplicate knows it is a construct and that it has no more existence beyond its bestowed life. Not only is the created life naturally inclined to be loyal to its maker on account of their shared personality, but it also must obey her like a demon bound to her service (but without any Limit issues). It is considered part of her body as an arcane link.
         The Storyteller controls the character like any other follower. Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, this one requires committed Essence and automatically terminates if that commitment ends. Withdrawing the Essence committed to this Charm or targeting the duplicate with appropriate countermagic causes it to scream and suffer a minute of unimaginable agony, which is usually spent vainly begging for help or life. When the creature's last minute passes or the construct dies by other means, its body dissolves to nothingness as though shredded by Adorjan's touch. Non-magical attire and carried possessions likewise disintegrate, though magical items endure. Alternately, the Infernal may end this Charm and absorb any duplicates within (Essence x 10) yards, causing them to unravel into crimson winds that flow into her, granting her their memories. She may later recreate absorbed duplicates if she desires. An Infernal may create and maintain as many separate duplicates as she is willing to sustain with committed Essence.
         Should any of these duplicates somehow earn a Celestial Exaltation, their facsimile-souls become the genuine article; they no longer depend on their creator to maintain their existence. As an alternate use, warlocks with female reproductive organs who aren't already pregnant may activate the Charm to induce parthenogenic but otherwise normal pregnancies in themselves. The resultant offspring is an Infernal Half-Caste and looks the same as its sole parent, calculating Inheritance as if she were mother and father both (which she is). The child otherwise is its own being and develops as such.
         A second purchase at Essence 4+ reduces the cost to one mote, one Willpower. The Exalt can also initiate real-time telepathic contact with any duplicate in the same realm of existence as a diceless miscellaneous action. Wards that block scrying block this power. Contact lasts for the rest of the scene or until reflexively dismissed. While the link remains open, either party can speak to the other, but neither can probe for anything except communicated thoughts. Only one link may be open at a time; opening another terminates the existing connection.
         A third purchase at Essence 5+ allows the warlock to spend 30m as a diceless miscellaneous action to dissolve her current body like the death of a duplicate. She may then transfer her Exaltation and souls into a duplicate, traveling as an invisible and infinitely fast wind. This fails if the site of either body is warded against teleportation. The duplicate becomes the warlock as a Shaping effect. The Infernal finds herself in her new body without any of its memories. All attunements to artifacts break, leaving no arcane link to help her find and retrieve magical possessions abandoned with her old body. A fourth purchase at Essence 6+ causes the Infernal to instantly learn all memories of any duplicate she replaces. Furthermore, she can initiate the transfer as a reflexive action subject to the Imperfection of the Silent Wind, using it as a defense by accelerating into dissolution.
         When Adorjan deigns to wield this Charm, she sends frail human parodies of her skills wrapped around the delicacy of a specific psychosis, choosing any of her infinite Urges and faces to define the creature's Motivation and appearance. The soulless creatures can't leave Malfeas on their own, but may be summoned (though not bound) as if they were First Circle demons. They have maximum human ratings in all traits, plus whatever combination of maximum specialties per Ability the Silent Wind chooses.

      <description>In her madness, the Silent Wind sometimes forgets the idea of down. This Charm may only be activated while moving at full dashing speed and deactivates if the warlock slows below this limit. For every action tick that passes for the Infernal while Sky-Vaulting Surge remains active, her player cumulatively records a +1 jump multiplier. So, if the character takes four Speed 3 dash actions in a row while using this Charm, her players records this as a +4 jump multiplier. If the Charm deactivates itself, the multiplier count resets back to zero and can only be reestablished with a sufficient running start. As soon as the Infernal next takes a standard jump action, Sky-Vaulting Surge deactivates and enhances that jump in the following ways: First, the jump does not penalize the warlock's DV and is not shortened by wound penalties or armor mobility penalties. Second, the distance the character can leap is ([Strength + Athletics] x Jump Multiplier) yards vertically or twice that distance horizontally. The jump multiplier can't exceed the warlock's (Athletics + Essence), regardless of how far she runs in advance of her leap. Finally, the Exalt suffers no falling damage from landing at the end of the jump, even if leaping from a very high perch where most of the descent is actual falling rather than controlled jumping.</description>

         When she encircled Creation as the River of Torments, Adrián formed a moat of fire, ice and razors to fence out the Unshaped nuisances that pestered the Primordials. Raksha who dared test her borders found her not so much impregnable as annihilating, shredding the works of their Shaping like cobwebs before ravaging them with her elements. Adrián is long dead, but Adorjan still remembers how to punish those who would make her other than herself. This Charm may be activated as a defense against any Shaping effect that targets the Infernal or any owned objects within (Compassion x 5) yards. Not only does Fond Remembrance of Adrián negate that effect in a violent spray of jagged Essence, but the being who used that Shaping effect suffers an automatically successful attack that inflicts (Conviction)L dice of damage from simultaneous laceration, incineration and deep freezing. The damage becomes aggravated once the Infernal attains Essence 6+. When no clear perpetrator can be identified for punishment, Adorjan's torments draw silent screams from the shinma instead.
         The protection afforded by this Charm lasts as long as the Infernal commits Essence to it. One-time Shaping effects shatter against the Charm's power, while mutagenic environments like the Wyld require continuous protection. The retaliatory damage pulse only occurs when Fond Remembrance of Adrián first activates, however, providing an incentive to reactivate this Charm if opponents press the point. Each active instance of this Charm defends against all Shaping effects from a single source. A valid source need not be present, but must exist (so resistance to the warping power of the Wyld lasts for the duration of commitment, even if the character leaves the Wyld).

         Adorjan is no more a thief than she is a murderer. She does not take from others to enrich herself, but only to free others from the weight of cherished possessions. This Charm may enhance any action to make a target character lose an object or structure he owns. Examples include Larceny actions to pickpocket an item, a disarming attack to remove a weapon, social attacks to convince the target to sell or surrender the property or attacks against the item in an effort to take it away from everyone. Any action opposing the enhanced action suffers an external penalty of the warlock's Compassion rating, including DV-based defenses. If the enhanced action succeeds in making the item unavailable to its owner, he also loses metaphysical ownership of the item.
         As a secondary effect, whenever this Charm causes its target to lose ownership of an object, the now-former owner experiences an Illusion effect convincing him that the item does not belong to him. Resisting the Illusion costs four Willpower (or one Willpower if the item is urgently important to its former owner, like a weapon disarmed in the middle of combat). If the Illusion takes hold, any attunement by the former owner to the object abruptly ends. Depending on the warlock's intent, the specific Illusion may alter memories so that the target believes he never owned the item or a subtler shift in perspective may cause him to reject the value of the lost item with a "sour grapes" attitude. A target under the effect of this unnatural Illusion can't take actions to reclaim the item until and unless he can be externally convinced of its value enough to build an Intimacy toward it. This dispels the Illusion and restores altered memories to normal. Unfortunately for victims of the Charm, the Illusion also forces them to resist such suggestions with the best social defenses available to them, though they are not compelled to physically attack anyone in defense of their ideas. Victims of this Charm can't spend Willpower to break the Illusion once it takes hold.
         If an Infernal has Essence 3+, this Charm may also take living beings with the same effects as taking inanimate items, though the former possession must also pay Willpower or succumb to an Illusion that makes him believe he does not belong to his former master (and possibly that he never did). This Illusion ends any Intimacy he has toward his former owner. In general, "owned beings" includes pets, underage progeny, slaves, retainers, cultists and so on. The Storyteller should carefully consider the power dynamics of other relationships when assigning this title. A matriarch of a Great House can certainly be said to own junior members of her family, while a domineering spouse may "own" her mate. Attachments to living beings are not so easily subverted; the Illusion costs only two Willpower to resist.
         With Essence 4+, taking the owned item or being away also has the effect of concealing the loss from others besides the former owner. Other characters do not notice or ignore the fact that the item is gone for the rest of the scene, but may spend one Willpower at any time to throw off this unnatural Illusion and come to their senses. If the owner resists the primary Illusion, this secondary Illusion also applies to him. With Essence 5+, the secondary Illusion lasts one day instead of one scene.

         Tragedy inspires the best in people. The weak graciously perish to make way for the strong, who rise above opposition and adversity to achieve greatness and ultimately perpetuate that hardship upon their enemies. Only Adorjan fully understands the importance of inauspicious events to the workings of fate, save perhaps for Jupiter whose nature prevents her from explaining her insights to the other Maidens. This Charm expresses the Adorjani hope that all of Creation will one day understand the elegant necessity of suffering as perfectly as she does.
         Infernals may target themselves or anyone they love with this Charm, though targets of affection need not reciprocate the feelings. Doing so invokes the sanity-shredding power of Adorjan, requiring an opposed roll of (Willpower + Essence) for the attacker and victim. If the target wins, he still loses three Willpower from the force of the mental onslaught. If the warlock wins, she imposes one permanent mutation.
         Broken Soul Wisdom may grant any derangement-based negative mutation to the target. Examples include Mood Swings, Delusions and Wyld Addiction (see Exalted, page 288-289), the last of which should be modified to represent a dependence on something more appropriate than the Wyld, like the need to kill someone once a week.
         Derangements inflicted with Broken Soul Wisdom can reduce the experience cost of traits besides positive mutations (which this Charm cannot grant). These other options include Essence rating, Virtues, Willpower and Adorjani Charms, though the last option only matters to targets capable of learning the Charms of the Silent Wind. Curing any of these derangements imposes a special Training effect on the patient, forcing her to pay back the free experience gained from her madness.

      <description>This Charm upgrades Tragic Love Amusement so that an Infernal may use its power to steal the love of others and force unwanted affections. Roll the warlock's (Charisma + Larceny + Compassion) against the target's Dodge MDV. The target must be within 100 yards, but no direct contact or communication is necessary to convey the insidious power of the Charm. If successful, the target gains an Intimacy of love toward the Infernal with all the effects noted for Tragic Love Amusement unless that target spends two Willpower. The type of love the target feels depends on the type of relationship the Infernal wants from him. Those whom she would bed find her overwhelmingly attractive, while those whom she would befriend find her immediately trustworthy and fascinating. Once a warlock has Essence 4+, she may even direct induced love toward a subject other than herself, though that subject must be present for the target to notice when the Charm first activates.</description>

         This Charm upgrades its prerequisite, allowing its effects to be bestowed on others as a Touch effect, though beneficiaries must know Old Realm to make use of the gift. Hostile targets may spend one Willpower to prevent the Shaping from internalizing their voice.
         Further purchase of Gift of Silence expands the radius of Eloquence in Unspoken Words, but eventually requires higher Essence ratings: second (1 mile; Essence 4+), third (10 miles; Essence 6+), fourth (100 miles; Essence 8+) and finally fifth (1000 miles; Essence 10). Increasing the range with repurchases does not increase the range at which others "tagged" by the Charm can telepathically speak.

         Love is transient and absurd. Since Adorjan cannot often convince the world of love's transience, her lessons chiefly focus on absurdity. This Charm upgrades Tragic Love Amusement when used to instill Intimacies in others through Wind-Carried Passion in the following ways:
         • If the victim has Compassion 3+, he must suppress his Compassion for a scene of deliberate effort to count toward weakening the Intimacy.
         • The first time the victim perceives the object of the created Intimacy each day counts as (victim's Compassion rating) scenes repairing any damage to the Intimacy unless he spends three Willpower to resist this unnatural mental influence. Once the Intimacy is fully eroded, it ceases to replenish itself this way.
         • Once the Infernal has successfully created an Intimacy of love in another character with Tragic Love Amusement, she can spend a point of Willpower to terminate that Intimacy. This is an unblockable, undodgeable social attack that instantly functions without a roll across all distance and realms of existence. As the Intimacy vanishes, the victim regains a Compassion channel and is permitted to delete his memories of the Intimacy's object as if he had used Freedom Lets Go.

         The Infernal opens his caste mark as an imperceptible third eye upon his brow. This spiritual organ perceives the flow of demonic Essence as a garish synesthetic overlay of colors and tastes. While this Charm is active, the Exalt gains the following benefits:
         • He perceives dematerialized demons with all senses, recognizing that they are incorporeal.
         • He perceives all possessing demons as smoky anima banners enveloping their hosts.
         • He adds (Essence) bonus successes on all rolls to notice natives of Malfeas, track them or pierce any disguise attempts. If the target isn't using magic to contest the action, the Infernal may spend one Willpower to automatically succeed.
         • Upon recognizing a perceived character as a demon or a Yozi, its nature becomes Obvious to him. The Storyteller provides a basic synopsis of the target's capabilities and Motivations (if any). This power imparts the same information about Infernal relics the Infernal can perceive.
         • He automatically recognizes non-demon natives of Malfeas as such upon perceiving them, although he learns nothing else.

      <description>Infernal Exalted understand demons better than other spirits because they are the most closely related in nature and power. However, the Primordials created the gods in the image of their aspects, so they remain understandable. Whenever a character with this Charm activates its prerequisite, she may pay an additional mote. Doing so expands the capabilities of the Charm to notice and identify gods as though they were demons and to track them like natives of Malfeas. Characters may purchase this Charm a second time at Essence 4+ to expand Hellscry Chakra to cover elementals this way for another one mote surcharge. A third purchase requires Essence 4+ but allows another one mote surcharge to cover Exalted.</description>

      <description>The Infernal gestures in the direction of a chosen incorporeal being. If he does not have a target in mind, the Charm randomly selects a dematerialized being from among those with the highest Essence rating within 10 yards of the Infernal. The Essence of Cecelyne grinds the being, manifesting it as an apparition of itself formed out of whirling sands. Although the manifested being remains dematerialized and therefore unable to hit back, the lacerating sands embedded in its ephemera allow corporeal beings to physically attack it as though it had materialized. However, each such attack drains one mote from Essence-wielding attackers. Multiple activations of this Charm may concurrently affect as many spirits as the Infernal wishes to tag with committed Essence.</description>

      <description>The law of Cecelyne binds the will of inferiors to their natural masters. Whenever a character with this Charm makes a social attack against a native of Malfeas who has a lower Essence rating, the target suffers an MDV penalty equal to the difference between their Essence ratings, and the attack is considered unnatural mental influence. Attacks enhanced this way cost the usual number of Willpower points to resist. Hierarchy works both ways, however. The Infernal suffers the same penalty against the social attacks of Malfean natives with higher Essence (unless they also have this Charm, in which case the DV penalties for both Charms don't stack), though any natural mental influence remains so. Infernals who also know Wayward Divinity Oversight (see p. 118) apply the MDV reduction to social attacks against gods of lesser Essence, but none of the other benefits or drawbacks of this Charm apply with such beings.</description>

         It is not the place of inferiors to pry into the lives of the great and powerful. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence against all characters (including animals) within (Essence x 100) yards who have a Dodge MDV less than the Infernal's (Charisma + Bureaucracy + Cult), compelling them to pay no attention to the Exalt or his affairs unless the Infernal's actions directly interact with or involve the weaker being. By the law of Cecelyne, the Charm cannot compel characters of greater Essence, even if their Dodge MDV is sufficiently low. Affected beings still notice the Infernal with their senses and remember everything they observe about him, though they steadfastly refuse to think about or discuss this obviously powerful, important and likely dangerous figure.
         Ignoring all uses of this Charm from all characters for one day costs one Willpower. Once a character has spent five consecutive days resisting this Charm, she grows jaded to its effects and does not have to spend Willpower again for another month.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may purchase this Charm a second time to expand the radius to (Essence rating) miles. Each dot of Essence above 4 allows another purchase, cumulatively multiplying the range by a factor of 10. Thus, with Essence 6, it affects valid targets within 600 miles. At Essence 10, it affects all valid targets in the same realm of existence.

         The Yozis transcend all lesser aspects of themselves. While active, this Charm exerts an unnatural compulsion against demons with a lower Essence rating, preventing them from making any physical attacks that would knowingly target or risk obvious immediate harm to the Infernal, even in self-defense. The compulsion does not deter demons forced to attack by sorcerous binding, however. Demons with an Essence rating one dot lower than the Infernal may overcome this Compulsion for a scene by paying one Willpower, allowing them to attack freely during that time. Demons of lesser Essence can't muster resistance. Hostile demons can work around this Charm to an extent. An area attack that encompasses the Infernal's location is forbidden, since this would cause obvious immediate harm, but attacking a cliff to catch the Infernal in a rockslide is acceptable, since the rockslide is an indirect consequence of the attack that triggered it. Once an Infernal has Essence 6+, the cost to activate this Charm reduces to zero motes, and demons of equal Essence are affected by a resistible compulsion (and those with one dot less can no longer resist). Even demons of equal Essence lose the opportunity to resist once the Infernal has Essence 8+.
         Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 4+ extends its effects to gods as though they were demons. All the usual loopholes apply, which is how the bravest gods aided the Exalted during the Primordial War.

         The Endless Desert wears away the impurities of corruption, scraping away until perfection is attained. This Charm can enhance any social attack aimed specifically at a single god or demon in which the Infernal compels that target to fulfill the official purpose for which it came into existence. In the case of gods, this means managing their dominion without regard to personal profit or other distractions. Demons must act out the mad urges that spawned them over personal ambitions or preferences. An attack enhanced by this Charm becomes an undodgeable unnatural mental influence. If successful, the target must spend a number of Willpower points equal to the Infernal's Essence rating (maximum five) to resist. This cost may be paid gradually, but until the final point is paid, an affected spirit remains unable to take actions outside the scope of its purpose. This Charm can affect elementals as though they were gods, provided that the elementals hold office in the Celestial Bureaucracy (such as censors).
         Demons affected by this Charm can be sorcerously bound and ordered to take actions that oppose the dictates of Sublimation of Ordained Purpose. However, each time the demon is forced into such a contradiction to take a non-reflexive action, it loses a Willpower point. If this reduces it to Willpower 0, both compulsions break, and it fully replenishes its Willpower pool. The demon may then act freely. Heaven notices the freeing of a Third Circle Demon as a Blasphemy effect.

         the Individual Mortals Who Pray To An Infernal Are As meaningless as individual grains of sand. Still, it is by the accretion of many grains that deserts come to be. This Charm allows the Exalt to hear individual prayers spoken from places of desolation as though she were a spirit. Actually listening to all prayers imposes a -3 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions; if the Infernal tunes them out, the Storyteller only relays the most widely repeated or urgently spoken prayers.
         Supplicants who pray from within a blight the Infernal has created with the Charm Holy Land Infliction (see page 125-126) may be answered by causing a random object in the supplicant's presence to glow and change into the Infernal's incarnate image as an Obvious Shaping effect for three motes. The enchanted object delivers whatever spoken response the Infernal sends through it (which may encompass one Social attack or informative response) and then returns to normal.

      <description>Cecelyne orders demonic society by religious tenets because the concept of reverence amuses her. An Infernal with this Charm doubles all mote and Willpower awards provided by her Cult background and may choose to heal in lieu of receiving any or all Willpower at the appropriate interval (two bashing health levels or one lethal health level per one Willpower). Additionally, whenever anyone of equal or lesser Essence prays to the character with a standard prayer roll, they must reflexively pay one Willpower to resist unnatural mental influence or instantly develop an Intimacy of reverence toward the Infernal. If the Infernal preys on this Intimacy with a social attack, she benefits from a full +3 Appearance modifier regardless of relative Appearance.</description>

         Cecelyne is always home within herself, finding sanctuary in her eternal wastes. An Infernal who learns this Charm gains the following powers as permanent enhancements to his competence:
         • He suffers no negative effects from exposure to a place of desolation, including penalties, environmental damage and even visual impairment.
         • All foraging rolls that would normally have a difficulty of 4+ have a difficulty of 1 instead (see Exalted, p. 139). This does not make impossible rolls possible in a place where the Storyteller determines absolutely nothing edible can be found.
         • The total penalty for starvation or thirst cannot rise above -3 within a place of desolation. The Exalt's perfected metabolism no longer produces waste of any kind, including sweat.
         • All mundane attempts to track the character automatically fail with zero successes unless the character allows himself to be tracked. Magically assisted tracking efforts suffer an external penalty of the Infernal's Essence rating instead.
         • He adds his Essence rating to the difficulty of all efforts to notice him with an Awareness roll in a place of physical desolation (spiritually desolate places as defined by Withered Soul Wastes don't count for characters who know that Charm). This benefit may be turned on and off at will.

         Trapped between forever and malfeas, the Endless Desert has nowhere to move but upon and through herself. A character who knows this Charm doubles her movement speed after all other modifiers when moving across a place of physical desolation. She also doubles the speed at which she can travel over long distances as a subtly non-Obvious effect, provided she employs some form of natural locomotion or rides a steed that is some sort of desert creature. This Charm cannot quicken the five-day journey between Malfeas and Creation.
         Essence 3+ Infernals with this Charm also can't suffer knockback or knockdown in a place of physical desolation unless the effect has a magical source. This defense manifests by reflexively Shaping their legs (and sometimes lower torso) into pillars of living sand that merge and flow into the ground, only to change back after the force passes.

         In her endlessness, Cecelyne may stand adjacent to space itself, existing in many points to strike down many foes at once. This Charm is a magical flurry containing a total number of physical attacks equal to (Cult + 2). The attacks bypass rate and suffer no multiple action penalties, while the flurry as a whole imposes a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any attack. The Infernal makes these attacks by collocating, and therefore makes one attack roll and separately compares the attack to a separate defender with each attack in the flurry. Use of First Cecelyne Excellency to enhance this action extends the same benefit to all attacks in the flurry at no additional cost. The first attack in the flurry may hit any target the Exalt can reach. Subsequent attacks require no additional ammunition (if they normally would) but must be aimed at targets within a 10-yard radius of the Infernal or the first target. The cost of this Charm is normally 6m, 1wp, but reduces to 4m, 1wp in a place of desolation.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may purchase Scorpion-Tailed Mirage Technique a second time. Whenever an Infernal with two purchases augments the first attack with First Cecelyne Excellency, he may direct all of those attacks at a single target, copying the attack through encirclement to strike from all sides.

         All places of desolation are adjacent to Cecelyne. This Charm can be used whenever the Infernal is journeying through such a locale and desires to reach Cecelyne. Indeed, even places that are not scarred with desolation may bridge to Cecelyne, though this is a Blasphemy effect. Regardless, no great portal of flames opens. No demon heralds appear to roar welcome to the Infernal. Instead, the ground shifts toward the landscape of the Endless Desert so subtly that the character cannot be sure exactly when he made the transition, save that it occurred sometime in the same scene. From there, five days of travel await to the walls of Malfeas.
         Infernals may also use Hell-Walker Technique as described above to travel from the walls of Malfeas to any blight created by Dune-Drowned Oasis Ritual (see p. 126). She need not have created the blight herself, but the destination requires that a unit of worshipers from the character's cult with a Magnitude at least equal to his Essence rating be present at the destination. The Infernal arrives bursting from the surface of the sand, gasping as if close to drowning.
         If a character uses this Charm while others are tracking him, they may find themselves drawn into Cecelyne without intending to unless the hunting party has Magnitude greater than the Infernal's Survival rating. Each individual pursuer or the leader of a pursuing unit makes a (Perception + [Survival or Occult]) roll at difficulty 5, with success allowing that character to turn back in time to avoid making the journey. She may also call out a warning to other pursuers traveling with her, letting them benefit from her success. If she fails or chooses to proceed anyway, she finds herself in the Endless Desert and must make a choice. She may attempt to continue tracking the Infernal and pursue him for the five days it takes to reach Malfeas, or she may attempt to find her way back to her original location with a five-day journey. In the latter case, she starts out lost (see sidebar). It is also possible to lead a willing unit up to the maximum permitted Magnitude into the Endless Desert this way, provided the Infernal is a special character in the unit.

      <description>The Endless Desert falls over the land, shredding gods and men alike under her jagged dunes. They are all the same to her. This Charm can enhance any instant duration action, allowing it to affect dematerialized or materialized targets alike regardless of the Infernal's current corporeal state. A god or demon injured by an attack enhanced with Stone-Flayer Touch loses motes equal to the number of health levels suffered as flecks of Essence grind away in luminous particles from the wounds. The cost of this Charm is one mote, one Willpower if the Infernal is incorporeal and attacking a material target with a physical attack and only one mote otherwise.</description>

      <description>It is the nature of Cecelyne that she borders infinity. No attack can encompass the wholeness of her being, and there-fore, no attack can truly hit her. This Charm is a perfect dodge against physical attacks. It can evade undodgeable but not unexpected attacks. As the attack should connect, it merely knocks a random spray of sand from the character's body as she dematerializes and rematerializes around it. Accordingly, attacks that can strike incorporeal beings may not be dodged this way, and the Charm is also vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Endless Desert. It is possible to use this Charm even in realms that do not normally permit dematerializing.</description>

         Whether struck by a single blade or pierced by a storm of arrows thick enough to block out the sun, only Cecelyne remains. An Infernal with this Charm may spend five motes and one Willpower rather than three motes when activating Sands Through Fingers Defense. She perfectly dodges the incoming attack as normal but also remains dematerialized until her next action tick. Attacks exploiting the Imperfection of the Endless Desert may ignore this dodge as if the Infernal were solid. The Infernal may invoke this Charm in the absence of an attack.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may choose to force their attacker into an incorporeal state as a Shaping effect rather than dematerializing themselves when activating Sands Through Fingers Defense. The attack simply crumbles like sand to flow around and through her and the attacker stays removed from the material world until his next action.

         Flesh cannot properly express those who would go among the reaches of forever as Cecelyne. The Infernal's body permanently assumes a natural dematerialized state like a demon, the manifest image of which appears in close inspection to be constructed from billions of jagged particles. The Infernal gains the benefits of a demon's panoply with regard to the material state of his own possessions and attuned artifacts. He no longer needs to breathe air, but suffocates normally if taken into a place where there is no living Essence to respire (such as the Underworld) unless he has Cult 3+ or Essence 6+. He longer requires food regardless of whether he is in a place of desolation, but he still hungers and gains penalties as described in Transcendent Desert Creature unless he has Cult 3+ to provide a steady diet of nourishing prayers. He may manifest or conceal his presence to communicate as a translucent apparition, toggling between the two states for a reflexive cost of one mote. Any anima banner display at the four to seven mote level or above automatically manifests regardless of whether his form has manifested.
         Finally, the Infernal gains the Charm Materialize for free as a benefit of purchasing this Charm (see Exalted, p. 295), using the standard formula of ([Willpower + Essence] x 5) motes to build a convincing simulacrum of what he used to look like. If this cost exceeds the maximum size of his combined Essence pools, then paying his entire pool is sufficient. Whenever a character with this Charm materializes, his body assembles itself out of fine grit that blows in a tightening vortex. Bones appear first, wreathed in webs of slimy visceral cording and pulsating meat until the final layer of ephemeral flesh encloses them in its borders. Exalted do not become spirits by purchasing this Charm; they merely alter their default corporeal state.

      <description>Cecelyne observes all who tread upon her until the tedium of their passage no longer holds her attention. Her contemplation of greater truths affords a measure of sanctuary for her will. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm active spends Willpower points to resist mental influence, her Dodge MDV cumulatively increases by two per point spent for the duration of the Charm. There is no upper limit on this bonus as it explicitly bypasses DV caps, but attacks taking advantage of the Imperfection of the Endless Desert bypass the Charm.</description>

         The law of Cecelyne is arbitrary. This is her prerogative, for the law serves only to maintain the power of the mighty over the weak. Faced with any sort of mental influence or an attempt to alter him with a Shaping effect, the Infernal may vocally retort by citing some law of Hell that contradicts the attacker's intentions and makes them illegal. The Infernal may make up a law on the spot, which need not be logical or consistent with previously established laws, though it cannot set the weak above the strong. It isn't necessary to draw attention to where the law comes from, though the Exalt may not misattribute it to another government.
         The declaration of law provides a perfect parry against the rebuked mental influence or Shaping attempt, regardless of whether the law has any legitimate authority over the attacker. This includes written attacks, provided the character argues aloud with the text. Additionally, the Infernal and all First Circle demons who overhear the pronouncement must spend one Willpower or instantly develop an Intimacy of loyalty toward the new law as a Servitude effect. This Charm is vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Endless Desert.

      <description>When angered, the Endless Desert erupts skyward in a burst of lacerating sand, cutting everything in her path to ribbons. Activating this Charm requires an aggressive or vulgar gesture in the direction of a targeted adversary within (Essence x 50) yards. Roll the Infernal's (Charisma + Occult) as a ranged attack; the explosion of sand can't be blocked without a stunt or Charm and bypasses all forms of cover. If it hits, the attack inflicts (the Infernal's Essence + Cult + attack successes) lethal piercing damage, and the target loses one Willpower from psychic shock. While the Willpower loss is a Shaping effect, the attack itself is not. This Charm costs three motes normally but only one mote against a target in a place of desolation. This attack can strike materialized beings while the Infernal is dematerialized, but the cost is three motes and one Willpower regardless of the area's desolation, and the attack is no more unexpected than if the Infernal were solid.</description>

      <description>attacking With The Environmentsome Of The Charms Listed In This Chapter Conjure environmental hazards to injure enemies. Such effects are still attacks in addition to being environmental damage, albeit attacks that can't be blocked or dodged. Characters may defend against imposed environmental hazards as they would any other or stop them outright with appropriate perfect defenses. An Infernal with this Charm may dispense with an attack roll when attacking with Sandstrike Blast (this costs the same as a targeted attack). Instead, the Exalt selects any location within range to be the epicenter of a wider burst. The eruption of sand fills a radius of (Essence x 2) yards around the epicenter, acting as a one-time environmental hazard with (the Infernal's Essence + Cult) lethal piercing Damage and (Infernal's Essence) Trauma. Characters damaged by the burst lose Willpower from Shaping as normal. Transcendent Desert Creature provides immunity to this Charm, in case the Infernal catches himself in the radius. Infernals who know Sands Through Fingers Defense may also initiate a burst centered on themselves when they activate that Charm by paying an additional two motes. Following the burst, the area remains choked with sand as from a violent sandstorm, limiting visibility like fog for the next 10 minutes (see Exalted, p. 135).</description>

         The Infernal's Yozi power grinds glowing sparks of Essence from his anima, each a microscopic portal into the Endless Desert that explodes on contact with the ground to spread her sands over the earth, covering an area of 10 square yards. Ground touched by this Charm is not simply covered in a fine layer of silver sand; the soil itself transmutes down to the bedrock and loses all fertility. Non-magical vegetation withers and dies after a day spent rooted in this terrain, with all biomass supernaturally decaying into more sand after a second day. All natural animals leave and shun the place unless specifically adapted for life in the desert. Structures remain intact, though heavy buildings may eventually sink into the sands. An uncapped demesne may eventually shrink, grow or shift aspects with enough time as normal for such a radical shift in geography. Used in the Wyld, the affected area becomes part of Creation. The Charm otherwise functions normally in all other realms of existence.
         An area marked by this Charm is a place of physical desolation, but more than that, it is a literal beachhead of the Endless Desert's glory. All Holy Charms cost an additional mote to activate within the area. All prayers to Cecelyne or any Infernal who helped create the blight spoken from within the area benefit from a -1 target number (typically 6), provided the supplicant spills blood on the sand as a sacrifice to lower the difficulty. More importantly, the blight has the potential for growth if the supplicant ritually executes a god or Exalt as an offering in this way, with Dragon-Blooded/Terrestrial deities adding (the victim's Essence rating x 100) square yards or (Essence x 500) square yards for Celestial gods and Exalted. Gods killed as sacrifices this way die forever and do not reform. The sacrifice's spilled blood and shredded flesh convert into fountains of choking sand dotted with glowing shards of Essence-fused glass unlike any crystals found in Creation. These shards are worth Resources 5 as a collection. The blight also grows in response to any resident social units actively worshiping Cecelyne or the blight's creator from within its borders, adding 10 square yards per dot of the unit's Magnitude per day so long as all members spend at least five hours a day in prayer there.
         If the blight intersects another area consecrated by this Charm, the two zones merge into one. Cecelyne cannot conceal her presence once the contiguous blight reaches 10 square miles. The area becomes a persistent Blasphemy, and Heaven will respond. The countermagic required to stop the spread is based on the Infernal's Essence rating, not the Charm's minimum Essence of 3, and must be cast from the exact center of the blight. However, countermagic only converts the area back into mundane desert. The spell Benediction of Archgenesis (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. II - The White Treatise, p. 88) completely counters and reverses all traces of this Charm's use within its area of effect.

         The Infernal basks in the worship of her followers, harvesting and focusing the Essence from their symphony of obscene chants and mad rites into a mockery of geomantic power. This Charm can only be activated within an area the Exalt has blighted with Holy Land Infliction. For as long as the area remains marked as a Dune-Drowned Oasis Ritual site, worshipers can "build" a level one Cecelyne demesne using the same overall rules as building a manse (see Exalted, p. 133).
         For this ritual to work, the Infernal must design a catechism for the project as per blueprint construction, using Linguistics in place of Craft (Lore and Occult requirements remain as is). Only another character who knows this Charm can check the accuracy of the rites. The cost of raw materials is the same as for slave labor, representing consumed ritual implements and carefully planned offerings. All members of the workforce must belong to the Infernal's cult, though the Exalt herself only has to personally witness the rite begin and remain observant for its final five days. If the constant worship follows the catechism to success, the area consecrates and exudes the Yozi energy of the Endless Desert as it comes into existence attuned to the Infernal.
         Terminating this Charm prior to completion spoils the effort, requiring a completely new catechism. The ritual also spoils if the blight reverts to mundane desert around the nascent demesne, perhaps as a result of countermagic. Destroying the blight after the demesne fully forms does not harm or weaken the place of power. This Charm may be repeatedly applied to increase the power of a demesne it has created, but each dot of increase requires a new catechism and the same effort as if building a manse of the new rating from scratch. Moreover, the process of upgrading cannot take less than a year per dot.

      <description>Cecelyne understands failure. Her failure to transcend all limits galls her even more than the fact that the Exalted imposed this punishment upon her. This Charm enhances an action to understand an observed target's emotions and displayed Intimacies in a social scene (see Exalted, p. 131). By the power of Cecelyne, the action automatically succeeds regardless of the roll results, as if the character had rolled twice the number of required successes. Furthermore, the Infernal understands all Intimacies that have been displayed in any way during the scene (as determined by the Storyteller) and their context toward other characters who are present. Finally, if the character would have succeeded by any threshold without this Charm, she intuits what the target believes his greatest failure in life has been.</description>

         Living beings are absurdly simple at their core. They want protection from the elements. They want food. In the absence of these basic necessities or a means of transcending them, nothing else matters. When an Infernal activates this Charm, she channels Cecelyne's aspects of hypocrisy above her qualities as the Endless Desert. Accordingly, she can only use this Charm in a place of desolation, but doing so causes a swarm of demon locusts to crawl out of the ground around her. The bugs are iridescent and no two alike. Together, the teeming millions resemble an obscene rainbow. Having crawled from the desolation that spawned them to life, the creatures quiver a moment as though hoping for greater purpose before they spasm and die. The locust corpses fill a radius of (Essence x 15) yards around the Infernal and provide nourishment to feed a unit of humans with Magnitude no greater than her Essence rating.
         Demon locusts smell and taste delectable to all palettes, faintly sweet and spicy and strangely familiar like an old family recipe the character hasn't sampled in years. They stay fresh without preservation for a week before they dry up and crumble to sand. Mundane preservation techniques can extend this time to a month, and a thaumaturgy ritual found in the Art of Alchemy and also the Art of Demon Summoning named "Candied Locust Amber" (1, Perception, 3, one hour) also exists. Each successful casting creates enough green glassy resin to indefinitely preserve a dozen locusts - a single meal - in sugary crystals until cracked open. These treats have begun to appear as occasional delicacies in markets and bazaars across the South.
         A single meal of these creatures provides complete and balanced nourishment for a whole day, including water. However, the meal also counts as one scene spent building an Intimacy of loyalty to the laws of Cecelyne and a scene toward a second Intimacy of reverence toward the Infernal provider. Characters who have conflicting Intimacies that would interfere with this process find those feelings weakened by their meals until nothing stands in the way of forming the new attachments.
         For one full day following the meal, any Intimacy built or attacked by the Charm can't be lessened or rebuilt, respectively. After a day, the Intimacies may be affected normally. Once a character eats nothing but demon locusts for a full week, she develops the Creature of Darkness mutation as a Desecration effect along with the cosmetic side effect of faintly iridescent eyes, which requires threshold 4+ to notice with a (Perception + Awareness) roll. If the Infernal knows Scoured Perfection of Form (see p. 129), a second week of eating nothing but locusts provides the Transcendent Desert Creature Abomination as further Desecration to those lacking its effects. The associated ocular iridescence grows more noticeable at this point (threshold 2+). After a decade of eating more locusts than other food combined, these mutations become hereditary and breed true. Mating with normal humans only has a 10 percent chance of yielding mutated offspring.
         Natural unintelligent animals who eat demon locusts gain all the standard effects from doing so, apart from loyalty to the laws of Hell, which they do not understand. Such beasts still become reverently grateful to the Infernal who fed them, though. If the Exalt eats her own food, the Intimacy she gains toward herself is one of smug self-satisfaction.

         Cecelyne provides for her faithful. This Charm can only be activated within a place of desolation. The ground cracks and crumbles into itself for five yards around the Infernal, tearing slabs of rock to pebbles and then the finest sand over the course of an hour. The vortex of torn earth shreds everything on or above this radius to a height of 100 yards like a severe sandstorm (see Exalted, p. 131) that ignores the soak of non-magical objects and structures but cannot harm the Infernal. When this destruction subsides, the sands of the radius dip inward like a bowl to a depth of five yards. Normal senses cannot feel the obscene generative Essence pooling in this pit, though Essence sight sees it for what it is.
         Hellish locusts constantly swarm out of the pit and die in gleaming multitudes around it, enough to feed a populace of any size with appropriate distribution. These creatures may be preserved as normal for creations of Locust Mana Plague but dissolve to dust as soon as they travel more than (their creator's Essence rating) miles from the pit that spawned them. A pit can provide for a population center of any size for 100 years before its magic dies, but it cannot feed the surrounding countryside or provide a viable export.

         Few beings are as they would choose to be. Certainly, Cecelyne would rather that her inner borders were not fet-tered to Malfeas. Where dissatisfaction endures, emptiness spreads the idea of the Endless Desert. Prior to using this Charm, the character must have observed the target express dislike of her present state and desire for some improvement of natural aptitude or training, such as beauty or skill with a sword. The wish need not be articulated with any intention of seeking its fulfillment or even seriously, but it must be unambiguous. In this condition is met, the Infernal need only be within (Essence) yards of the target and activate Verdant Emptiness Endowment. Doing so causes the target to gain one dot of the Attribute, Ability or specialty that best pertains to the observed wish. This Training effect can't raise any trait above its normal maximum, nor does the Infernal need any rating in a trait to bestow it. This Charm also can't target those who have any outstanding experience debt from prior use of any Training effect.
         It is possible for the target to unconsciously reject the gift for a cost of one Willpower, thereby avoiding the gift and its hidden price tag. This effect is not Obvious, however, so the target's player only knows the trait being offered and the associated experience cost, without learning anything about the source of the effect or the price. Once the gift is accepted, the magic is done, and countermagic can't reverse it.
         Traits improved by this Charm do so over the course of the scene, fast enough to be miraculous but slow enough that no one has to know the source of the blessing. The Yozis always exact a price for their gifts, however. At any point in the future, the Infernal may come back to that individual and demand any one task. If the target understands the demand and the task isn't literally impossible, she intuitively understands that doom will befall her for failing to obey. After one month or as soon as the task becomes impossible (or constitutes an unacceptable order), the duty ends with-out harm to the beneficiary. However, if the character stops working toward the goal for more than a day while the duty remains, she suffers a number of automatic botches equal to the Infernal's Essence rating. These botches match the effects of breaking an oath sanctified by an Eclipse Caste Solar and linger until the worst possible time. It is possible to target oneself with the Charm, in which case the Infernal obviously owes himself nothing.

         This Charm expands the scope of its prerequisite, Ver-dant Emptiness Endowment, allowing that Charm to bestow dots of certain Backgrounds as an alternative to other traits. These dots take a number of weeks equal to the character's new rating in the raised Background to appear and do so through a strange conjunction of coincidences that appear implausible but well within the bounds of possibility. Even as pattern spiders chitter impotent protests at the disruption, they find the pattern of good fortune tangled into their work and have no choice but to integrate the foreign design or damage the Tapestry even worse. This Charm can't bestow Backgrounds on a character while a previously bestowed dot is pending resolution.
         The beneficiary does not even have to begin paying for the dot until it is received. As a Training effect, each Background dot provided by this Charm costs three experience points.
         The Backgrounds that may be improved by this Charm are as follows: Abyssal Command, Allies, Acquaintances, Backing, Command, Connections, Contacts, Cult, Followers, Henchmen, Influence, Mentor, Resources, Reputation, Retainers, Salary, Sifu and Spies. Some of these Backgrounds may be found in the various Manuals of Exalted Power. Any other selections require express Storyteller approval and must pertain to some form of social advantage rather than anything more innate or supernatural. Targets of this Charm may not be given Backgrounds they are normally unable to possess for whatever reason.
         Infernals can improve their own social standing with this Charm. If they are doing so to restore previously attained ratings in the Backgrounds that were lost without any experience point recompense or other restitution (as determined by the Storyteller), there is no experience cost associated with the regained dot. The benefit does not apply unless the previous ratings in question were paid for, whether through initial Background dots, bonus points or experience. "Free" Backgrounds awarded through plot events remain ineligible until they have been fully paid for (three experience points per dot).

         This Charm expands the scope of its prerequisite, allowing that Charm to bestow permanent mutations as an alternative to other traits. The mutations in question must fulfill a desire, though they can do so in ways the supplicant never imagined or wanted. For example, it is necessary to become a creature of darkness for the Desecration to do anything else, so any desire to be changed automatically makes that mutation permissible. Moreover, the changes must suit the aesthetics of the Endless Desert, incorporating only those physical characteristics suited for dwelling within her and mental changes congruent with her law.
         Any single permissible mutation may be given by each application of this Charm, within the normal limits of Verdant Emptiness Endowment and the Desecration keyword. All of the effects of Transcendent Desert Creature may be given as an Abomination with the same name.
         Alternately, this Charm may also be used to remove mutations, in which case the target still owes the Infernal later, but the former mutant regains any experience points invested in the trait. It is not uncommon for Cecelyne to give a mutation and collect the price, then collect again to remove the gift when the target comes to fear and hate what he has become.

      <description>Cecelyne is both malevolent and endlessly giving, as those who mistake her gifts for kindness and indebt themselves to her law can attest. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm overhears prayers with Penitents Like Scattered Grains, she may answer those prayers by activating Verdant Emptiness Endowment as if the supplicant were in range of that Charm. The prayer itself provides the arcane link to convey the miracle answer. If other Charms expand the options that Verdant Emptiness Endowment can give, these expansion effects may also be transmitted. Infernals who know the Charm Locust Mana Plague (see page 126-127) may answer prayers requesting food by having the demon locusts crawl into life around the supplicant.</description>

      <description>Places of physical desolation most closely resonate with Cecelyne. She is, after all, more geography than goddess. However, the scope of her dominion goes far deeper than harsh lands. Upon activating this Charm, the character's understanding of the term "place of desolation" expands to include regions afflicted by spiritual desolation that aren't part of the Underworld. Wherever any community dwells where a majority of members suffer endemic social injustice fueled by corruption and vice, the razor grit of Cecelyne trickles as inevitably as through an hourglass. Unsettled but lush areas remain useless to the Charm, as do regions inhabited by predominantly just societies. While most major cities in Creation offer bastions to Cecelyne, most small villages and farmsteads adhere to community standards that keep her out (at least during peacetime). Such communities are becoming rarer as the Time of Tumult worsens.</description>

      <description>When demons enter Creation, they track a little of Cecelyne with them. It's not much, these few grains, but every footstep out brings the Endless Desert one mote closer to freedom - or would if she were less than infinite. Once an Infernal learns Footprints Like Heralds Focus, every demon's presence qualifies as a place of spiritual desolation for Withered Soul Wastes. For the purposes of this Charm, the presence extends to a radius of (the spirit's Essence x 10) yards for demons of the First or Second Circle. Third Circle demons exert a presence with a radius of (Essence) miles.</description>

      <description>The Endless Desert is more than a place. She is also an idea adjoining space and time. This Charm exudes the Essence of Cecelyne as a spherical aura extending to a radius of (Essence x 10) yards from the Infernal. Once created, the psychic field remains stationary and endures for one week. Within this space, all efforts to erode positive Intimacies need only a single scene of appropriate action to succeed regard-less of the listener's Conviction rating. The effort required to build negative Intimacies likewise decreases. If eroding a particular positive Intimacy or building a particular negative Intimacy would conflict with a character's Motivation, the effort requires normal effort to succeed. Additionally, the area is considered a place of spiritual desolation (see Withered Soul Wastes). The effects of this Charm are extremely subtle and virtually imperceptible, even to Essence sight and similar magical awareness. Characters get a faint sense that something is indefinably wrong with a successful reflexive difficulty 3 (Perception + Socialize) roll made by their players.</description>

      <description>The law of Cecelyne is a weapon against those who imagine any civilization can know justice in a world that no longer obeys its creators. This Charm may target any organization with Magnitude no greater than the Infernal's Essence rating, provided at least one member is present for the activation. For the next month, every place where that organization conducts official business or activities of any kind or owns property takes on the properties of a place blighted with Endless Torment Emanation. This field extends 100 yards from any valid activity or property and lasts for one day after this activity ceases or the organization no longer owns said property. Infernals may purchase this Charm a second time, in which case the maximum Magnitude of organization she can affect increases to her Willpower rating. Organizations larger than the permitted Magnitude may only be attacked piecemeal with this Charm, assaulting individual bureaus or departments.</description>

The Infernal dissolves into a whirling eddy of dust and sand, which is carried away from the attacker on the prayers of her followers, reforming within ([Cult x 5] + Essence) yards. This Charm cannot move through any barrier which would prove impermeable to a trickle of sand. Dust Devil Feint may relocate the warlock to places she could not otherwise reach, such as to a higher perch.</description>

      <description>The Endless Desert especially loathes opponents with pretensions toward their own divinity. Her scorn transforms the Essence of their unworthy prayers into a vessel for her outrage. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite, so that the Infernal erupts into a massive, shrieking dust cloud when it is activated in a place of desolation. In addition to its usual effects, the sandblast knocks her attacker back (5 + [attacker's Cult x 3]) yards if he fails a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll at a difficulty of the Infernal's Cult rating. This is effective even against bowmen and other long-range attackers, hurling them with extruded wisps of grinding particulate force.</description>

         Though savants marvel that Cecelyne's vast expanse may be crossed in only five days, the truth is that if the Endless Desert wills it, she may stretch her roads out to infinity. Expressing this principle, the Infernal holds her hand out, palm-first, toward a single opponent. This is treated as a Blockade Movement action, though the Infernal rolls (Willpower + Cult) in place of ([Strength or Dexterity] + Athletics). Should the Infernal win this contest, her target is rendered unable to approach her for the duration of the Charm. The landscape between warlock and pursuer stretches out infinitely, and although the target perceives himself to be moving, no amount of exertion on his part can close the distance between the two. To observers, the area around the target seems to confusingly sprawl outward without limit, but does not actually move him away from any other individuals or objects. This Charm cannot be used on a single opponent more than once per action.
         This Charm only functions in places of desolation. It does not count as a Charm use if deployed upon the sands of Cecelyne herself, including areas blighted by Holy Land Infliction (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals, p. 125).
         Swallowed in Eternity adds (Essence) dice to the roll-off against conflicting effects such as Eternal Infatuation Dance (see Glories of the Most High-The Maidens of Destiny, p. 28).

         Some demons escape the prison of their ancestor overlords. Sometimes this serves the will of the Yozis. Often, the broken creators simply resent inferiors enjoying privileges they may not. To end such frustrations, an Infernal may use this Charm to select any perceived demon within (Essence x 100) yards. The demon in question appears to slightly erode at the edges, with patches of skin crumbling first to dust and then seeming nothingness as the scoured away Essence trickles into Cecelyne. This process is too slow to result in any actual injury. However, for as long as the Charm remains active, the demon can't heal by any means. Whenever it suffers levels of damage, the injured tissue dissolves further (this cosmetic injury doesn't increase the number of levels suffered). After applying each damage level, the Storyteller checks whether the total number of non-bashing damage levels currently applied to the demon exceeds its Essence rating. Once this threshold is reached, the spirit disintegrates completely and its scattered Essence makes the five-day crossing to reform in the dunes just outside the walls of Malfeas. The spirit arrives in the same condition as it vanished. Scouring Banishment technique may be activated multiple times to mark different demons for banishment. The cost is five motes (plus one Willpower if the target belongs to the Second or Third Circle). With Essence 4+, the Infernal may use a single activation to affect as many valid targets as desired, provided she pays the requisite cost for each. Essence 6+ drops the cost to target First Circle demons to one mote each.
         Essence 3+ Infernals may purchase this Charm a second time. In addition to the usual effects, targeted demons can't regain Willpower from stunts. Other means of Willpower recovery function normally. Furthermore, if a targeted demon runs out of Willpower points for any reason, it dissolves and reforms in the sands outside Malfeas as explained above.
         A third purchase requires Essence 4+, extending the Charms power to affect gods, elementals and devas as though they were demons (eroding via damage and Willpower loss alike). The Yozis can feel whenever a god enters their realm this way and know the identity of that deity. How and whether they respond depends on how much they personally hate the intruder. The titans consider elementals below Essence 6 too pathetic to notice this way, though greater elementals draw their attention like gods.
         Ceclyne does not like to think of the Underworld, and so it has not occurred to her that a fourth purchase is possible (also requiring Essence 4+). This purchase broadens its power to affect ghosts as per other spirits, though the Yozis never dignify the dead with automatic notice. It remains to be seen how long it will take for a warlock to realize this possibility and so force Cecelyne to gain this power. Perhaps she will be grateful to know she can damn the dead to the eternal suffering of the Demon Realm. Perhaps she will be horrified by the reminder of her own mortality. Only time will tell.

         While the souls of the Yozis must appear before the Exalted when bidden by the proper rites, they may resist enslavement by those who invoke this right. This Charm can enhance any physical attack against a demon, though generally the warlock pulls the blow so as not to harm the target. If the attack hits, it lays a mark of Primordial Essence upon the target until the next Calibration. This mark affects demons as follows:
         • If they belong to the First or Second Circle, they add the Infernal's Essence in bonus dice on all rolls to resist sorcerous binding or banishment (maximum +5). This does not apply against the warlock who marked them.
         • They suffer an external penalty of the warlock's Essence on all rolls to resist her attempts to sorcerously bind or banish them.
         • If multiple Infernals lay their mark on a single demon, only the greatest bonus applies; however, each warlock benefits normally from her own mark when attempting to bind or banish the demon.
         • If the demon is currently bound and tracks Limit (as per guidelines in Roll of Glorious Divinity I and II) when the mark is placed, the Infernal knows this and may add (his Willpower rating) Limit points to the demon's track.
         Cecelyne was made to swear she would not use this Charm as part of her surrender oaths. Much to her frustration, she later discovered this prohibition also extended to her akuma.

         Cecelyne grants her favor to organizations whose policies express the madness of her law. This Charm may be used to enchant any social unit with a Magnitude no greater than the Infernal's (Essence or Bureaucracy, whichever is higher). The warlock must be socially interacting with the unit's leader and communicate the full intent of the Charm while using it, gaining the leader's assent. It is permissible to secure cooperation prior to activation via social attacks. Larger units must be targeted piecemeal as individual departments or bureaus. The warlock selects one task the organization must perform at recurring intervals or actions that must be avoided at all times; the burden should be strange and onerous without any seeming connection to the organization's function, but the task or taboo must be something the unit can accomplish. The Storyteller assesses how much extra work and hassle the chosen task/ban causes for the target organization from among the options listed below.
         The severity of the drawback determines how many bonus successes the unit and all of its individual members receive when taking actions that directly further the enchanted unit's Policy. If the organization ignores the blessing the Infernal has given them and does not implement the task/ban within a week, the power of Cecelyne grinds the organization's fate as a Shaping effect. This also happens as soon as the task is not completed on schedule or the taboo is broken. The unit suffers one automatic botch on a critical action as per a broken Eclipse oath, and then the magic ends. Applying appropriate countermagic to the unit leader breaks the effect without any doom, as does complete disbandment of the unit. If the leader changes, the new leader becomes the anchor point for applying countermagic. A change in Policy does not affect the Charm. So long as the unit keeps to its duty or avoids its ban, the enchantment continues indefinitely. Units already enchanted by Inauspicious Benediction of Endeavor can't be targeted with further applications from any character.
         Inauspicious Benediction of Endeavor may target an individual rather than a social unit, though it would not occur to Cecelyne herself to do so. Affected characters receive the bonus successes awarded by the burden toward actions directly supporting their Motivation. The Infernal may target herself, though the associated burden is no less onerous.
         Inconvenience (2 successes): The duty isn't fun, but it's not really all that much work either. The primary weight of the burden stems from the distastefulness of the task. Example: stopping work three times a day at fixed times to ritually venerate the law of Cecelyne regardless of whatever else is going on. For taboos, the organization must avoid a particular convenience, but the loss doesn't really impede operations in any measurable way. Example: No one in the organization may imbibe alcohol. An inconvenience that doesn't frustrate members on a regular basis shouldn't qualify for any bonus.
         Challenge (3 successes): The required task demands that members go out of their way, typically to do something immoral, abhorrent or both, but nothing that would seriously conflict with the average member's Intimacies. Example: Sacrificing a pure white kitten who has never known pain following the close of business each day; once a month, one member chosen at random must voluntarily accept being beaten past unconsciousness by other members. Taboos present equivalent difficulty and can be broken accidentally by the incautious. Example: Never kill a locust; never speak any translation of "Unconquered Sun".
         Hardship (4 successes): The duty or ban seriously impacts the day to day operations of the organization, forcing it to cover up activities that would certainly attract immediate censure from the public and external authorities. Examples: The slow bleeding death of one unblemished baby who has never seen a Calibration assures one month of good fortune; never thank a god or a god's priest for anything, even with hollow or ironic courtesy.

This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes.

      <comment>On Cecelyne: "Like so much of Cecelyne's power, her Overdrives are a double-edged sword. Wayward Serf Remonstrations makes demon-summoners hate you (a common refrain in Malefactor Charms), while Specks Before Infinity makes it a very bad idea to pursue the usual Wyld Hunt tactic of spamming lots of mortals at the Infernal. On the other hand, it also gives you trouble if you want to go fight Leviathan. But hey, at least Sunken Luthe counts as a place of spiritual desolation. You'll be able to work something out." -H</comment>

         Cecelyne may give her blessings slowly, the better to exact compounding price for each piece of her gift. But this need not be so. With purchase of this Charm, an Infernal's power to wield Verdant Emptiness Endowment grows mightily as follows:
         • She may bestow degrees of thaumaturgy like standard specialties; as usual, she need not possess the degree in question. The target must meet all prerequisites for learning the degree.
         • She may give multiple dots of the same trait as a single blessing, as many as desired (subject to the usual trait maximum for the beneficiary). Since this is a single blessing, the number of botches associated with failing to pay the price is based on conferring one dot, regardless of the total number actually conferred. Conversely, since this is a single blessing, it does not matter if the target would end up in experience debt after a single dot - all dots still get conferred.
         • She may bestow Attributes, Abilities or specialties instantly. This is Obvious, as swirling silver sands envelop the target and transform her mentally and physically as appropriate. If she knows Bestowal of Accursed Fortune and grants multiple Background dots, they still appear in weeks according to the new rating and cannot be granted faster.
         • The price to refuse her blessing is (half her Essence rating, rounded up) Willpower points rather than just one. As a reminder, rejecting a gift is not considered resisting mental influence.? She may bestow her blessing on anyone she can perceive within one mile, rather than being limited to (Essence rating) yards.
         • With Essence 4+, she may bestow trait dots on mortal characters who are in experience debt.
         • With Essence 4+, the cost to use Verdant Emptiness Endowment on a target may be lowered to a single mote, provided the target already accepted a blessing from the Infernal's use of the Charm earlier in the scene. However, as soon as the target pays Willpower to reject a gift, the cost resets to normal.

         From time to time, the sands of the Endless Desert swell and burst apart, releasing a faint gust of perfumed wind, sweet and spicy and full of promise of benevolence not fitting to the Demon Realm. Those meant to breathe such grace do so five days hence, and by the power of Cecelyne, cripples may walk and the blind may see - the better that they walk into the sands of eternity and behold her infinite splendor.
         This Charm is a permanent enhancement of its prerequisite, allowing the Infernal to grant the expressed desires of others for healing, though she may not heal herself. It is even possible to grant a wish that is not communicated, but intended (as defined by the target's player), such as a coma patient's desire to wake. Five days before bearing witness to such a request, a perfumed breath escapes the warlock's lips unnoticed by her or anyone else - it is the faintest of sighs. And yet, in the place and moment for which the breath was intended, it takes root within the flesh of the beneficiary as a great blessing.
         The power of this Charm can instantly mend any single Crippling injury in the blink of an eye, or heal (warlock's Essence or Cult) non-aggravated damage levels the target currently suffers. Having accepted the blessing, the target instantly develops an Intimacy of reverence toward the Infernal (or shifts the context of any existing Intimacy to reverence), and this natural Emotion effect cannot be further resisted due to the target's acceptance.
         There are limits to Cecelyne's power, if not to herself. Once a target has received healing from this Charm, he cannot be healed again until five days pass. Only during Calibration does this restriction ease, during which targets may be healed as often as the Infernal chooses to activate Verdant Emptiness Endowment for the cause and pays full cost to do so (no activation cost discounts may be applied).
         With Essence 4+, a single activation can mend one Crippling wound and heal damage (rather than having to choose). Essence 5+ allows the healing of all Crippling wounds and appropriate damage levels, but doing so adds a surcharge of four motes per Crippling wound past the first.

         When Cecelyne strikes a bargain, doom befalls those who break it. Sometimes, this is insufficient. Upon learning Killing Clause Largesse, the Infernal may optionally increase the price of defaulting whenever she uses Verdant Emptiness Endowment to grant a trait dot. Should the beneficiary fail to carry out the price demanded of him, he does not face botches. Instead, for each botch he would have suffered, the Storyteller chooses one time in which to enhance a physical attack solely targeting him as a Shaping effect. Attacks enhanced this way become unblockable, undodgeable and unsoakable. If an attack does not hit in spite of these advantages, the "botch" is not spent and lingers on for another opportunity to slay him. Whenever a warlock attacks someone who has pending "botches" hanging over him as a result of her prior use of Verdent Emptiness Endowment, she immediately knows this fact in step 1 and may spend one of the "botches" to augment her attack. Deliberately spending a "botch" this way uses it up, even if the attack misses.
         With Essence 4+, any mortal hit by a "botch" enhanced attack automatically dies as a Shaping effect before resolving damage. Against victim shielded from this automatic death, damage may still suffice to do the job.

         Cecelyne may demand a fixed price for her gifts, if an open-ended one. That is usually her way. Still, she is an immortal, and that gives her cause for patience. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm grants a trait dot with Verdant Emptiness Endowment, she can demand repayment at any time and the total number of botches imposed for failing to meet the demand increases by one (i.e. Essence +1). However, she can also wait and let the debt grow. For each Calibration that arrives without having asked for repayment, the total number of botches cumulatively rises by one. There is no limit to this accumulation.
         Example: A prince bargains with the Endless Desert to assume power, gaining great Influence as a king. Nothing is asked of him, and so he reigns uneasily and eventually thinks himself free. Forty years later, he dreams of silver sands as his patron contacts him once more, demanding his beloved daughter in payment. Should the old king refuse, he faces 51 botches for his impertinence (Essence 10 + 1 + 40). Pity the Celestial whose bargain comes due a millennium hence.

         The Endless Desert exacts a terrible price for her generosity. That doesn't mean her generosity needs not also have strings attached. Upon learning this Charm, the Infernal gains the power to add a clause to each gift she bestows with Verdant Emptiness Endowment. To do this, she must offer to fulfill the target's expressed desire and inform the target of the clause, which may be an action the target must never do or which he must do in response to specific stimuli. The clause must be something the target is actually capable of doing, though the difficulty is irrelevant. If all these conditions are met and the target accepts the blessing, the clause takes effect. Should the target ever break the terms of the clause, the blessing fades away over the same time it took to appear (returning appropriate experience points if applicable).
         Example: Sulumor offers to make a warrior deadlier with his sword, granting the Melee specialty Swords +1. She warns that the gift is contingent on him never raising a hand against her. This gift takes a scene to appear, so if he ever physically attacks her, the specialty disappears at the end of the scene.

         Fortunes rise. Fortunes fall. A prince dwells in splendor one day and walks the streets destitute the next. A pauper takes his place. Dunes swell to mountains, then crumble away in the wind. The cycle repeats. It is all meaningless. Upon learning Palaces Like Sandcastles, the Infernal learns how to teach existence the truths best known to Cecelyne.
         Whenever the warlock uses Bestowal of Accursed Fortune to grant Background dots to a beneficiary who accepts them, she may optionally choose a victim whom she touched or socially interacted with in the past day. The victim must possess the Background the warlock wishes to bestow at a rating equal or greater than the end result of her blessing. Should all these criteria be met, the victim loses dots at the same rate that the beneficiary gains them. Improbable coincidences ensure the good fortune of the victim actually transfers to the beneficiary, so it may be that an unfortunate student falls out of favor with his Sifu and is supplanted by a new pupil. A rich man may find his Resources confiscated by the state and given to a rising star as a reward for loyal service to his country. The Storyteller decides the story that ensures the transfer. Any time in the weeks that lead up to the final outcome, appropriate countermagic applied to the victim removes the curse and spoils the blessing entirely. The curse is also a Shaping effect and may be excised accordingly to ruin the warlock's plans. Once the transfer is complete, the effect ends and cannot be reversed with countermagic or anti-Shaping effects.
         Depending on the tale the Storyteller uses to explain the Charm's effects, the victim may realize his good fortune has gone to another or not. Even if the transfer isn't immediately obvious, investigation may suffice to reveal it. Few victims appreciate such turn of events and most seek retribution of some sort. If the beneficiary should perish before the transfer is complete, the curse is broken and nothing is lost. The Infernal may choose for the narrative to be blatantly clear at the time of activation in order to incite this very outcome, forcing the Storyteller to choose a tale that ensures it. The reverse is not true. Though the warlock may cover up the transfer through mundane means, she can't activate the Charm in such a way that the transfer automatically remains secret. Fate is capricious even when compelled.

      <description>This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. The Infernal may ignore the MDV of any First Circle demon when using any form of mental influence against it, forcing the spirit to accede to the command or pay the necessary Willpower to resist. A second purchase requiring Essence 6+ enchants these commands so that First Circle demons suffer one unsoakable level of aggravated damage for every Willpower point they spend resisting any mental influence from the warlock. Bound demons must resist commands that violate their orders. Even so, Cecelyne grinds to dust those who display such impudence regardless of how much choice they have in the matter. A third and fourth purchase (requiring Essence 7+ and 9+ respectively) extend the same cascade of benefits against Second Circle demons, making the Infernal truly Unquestionable in the laws of hell.</description>

      <description>This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. In addition to stopping physical attacks, the Charm also prevents demons from making social attacks specifically targeted at the Infernal unless compelled by sorcerous binding. Attacks that affect all listeners (like most Performance attacks) may be used, as may targeted social attacks to convince the Infernal of something that is already in line with her Motivation, Urge or Intimacies. If the MDV reduction for such traits applies, the attack is valid. Likewise, if the attack is a form of natural influence and the demon uses a stunt to reference how the attack is in line with the warlock's prior actions, it bypasses this Charm. If Unquestionable Yozi Authority can affect gods, they are likewise socially inhibited.</description>

Prayers spoken by an entity's priests are personal enough that this Charm can't overhear them. The entity receiving the prayers does not know the Infernal is listening in, but the existence of prayer eavesdropping magic is well known to Celestial deities.</description>

         The Infernal reaches out with Primordial Essence and evokes mass destruction, choosing any epicenter she can perceive up to one mile away. The center must be within a place of desolation and the effect spreads out to affect a maximum diameter of one mile. On a desert, the ripple of force that spreads from the epicenter leaves concentric rings across the dunes like a colossal meditation garden. Particulate matter levitates and begins to blow in a breeze that nothing else feels, though not in sufficient volume to impair visibility. If the Infernal suffers any levels of damage in the ticks until his next action, the Charm's energies recoil and express themselves through him by relocating the epicenter to make him ground zero.
         Wherever the epicenter ends up, it explodes after 10 ticks and fills the affected area with a cloud of sand stretching a mile in height that impairs visibility like fog. The cloud takes a full hour to settle to the point where it no longer obscures vision, during which time the area is a place of physical desolation. More importantly, everything in the radius suffers damage from a one-time environmental hazard with piercing Damage of (the Infernal's Essence + Cult)L and Trauma equal to the Infernal's Essence rating. Damage from this charm can come from lacerating sands, crushing sinkholes or any other Storyteller-approved manifestation of "desert power" that can inflict injury. Incorporeal beings in the radius suffer just as much as materialized beings.
         Warlocks who know the Charm Scoured Perfection of Form may forgo inflicting damage when using World-Grinding Sandstorm Devastation. Doing so allows them to saturate the area with mutagenic Essence that imposes one mutation on all valid recipients of that change caught in the blast who do not pay two Willpower to maintain integrity. The mutation must be appropriate to the themes and imagery of Cecelyne. This is a Desecration effect, so unless the Infernal first uses the Charm to make everyone a creature of darkness, only those already labeled as such will be altered by whatever else the warlock has in mind. Once the effect detonates, its lasting effects can't be reversed with countermagic.
         Because the effects of this Charm do not go off immediately, quick enemies may move themselves out of the blast area in time. The 10-second delay is inconsequential to the long ticks of mass combat, though small units should be afforded a chance to get away if fast enough. Complementary units of Magnitude 3+ have no chance to mobilize that quickly, at least not without powerful war magic.
         If an Infernal has Essence 5+, the entire area continues to inflict its damage at recurring one-minute intervals as the erupted sand whips around in lacerating, unholy vortices. The Infernal may shape any or all of this effect into a likeness of her iconic anima banner at will or leave it an inchoate force. More importantly, she may also move the area of effect across the land at four times her move speed, telekinetically changing its speed and/or direction with a diceless miscellaneous action or stopping it reflexively. After an hour, the effect dissipates. If the warlock creates a mutagenic sandstorm, she must select the one mutation it imposes at activation; spending Willpower to resist grants the resisting character immunity to that particular storm.
         Essence 6+ Infernals may have one storm with Indefinite duration, enduring until countered. This provides both superweapon and refuge (since Transcendent Desert Creature grants immunity to its effects), though it also ensures militant heavenly reprisal.

The warlock experiences the answers as bursts of supernatural intuition bordering on telepathy.</description>

         This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite so that locusts emerge from and devour any foodstuffs within the radius of their appearance, growing thinner and then ultimately dying as they gorge themselves. Foodstuffs include all standing drinkable liquids, dead animal matter and the most edible parts of all plants. The locusts are not predators and do not harm living animals. Walking dead caught in the feasting suffer three levels of unsoakable aggravated damage from the gnawing; the locusts do not care whether meat walks when they eat it. Units composed solely of walking dead extras caught in the radius lose a dot of Magnitude. The Storyteller should also apply this damage to other characters that meet the locusts' definition of food, such as wood elementals. Abyssal Exalted, Ghost-Blooded and other technically living beings attuned to death confuse some locusts into biting, inflicting a one-time environmental hazard (Damage 3B, Trauma 5).
         The Infernal may also double the Magnitude of those they can feed with a single activation and triple the radius in which the bugs appear, but doing so adds the Blasphemy keyword.

      <description>
         This Charm upgrades its prerequisite with a new optional effect powered by chaining a live First Circle Demon at the center of its radius. The pit devours this offering and thereafter spawns a new member of that demon race that crawls out slime-caked and howling with instinctual terror of Adorjan each midnight. Creating a new species of demon costs 1xp in lieu of a sacrifice, but any of the demons who rise from that pit may serve as a "seed" for other spawning pits. The warlock's player designs any new race (subject to Storyteller approval). Demons birthed by a pit come into life fully mature as average members of their species, unbound and materialized. They also begin life devoid of motes and Willpower points and with no special loyalty to their creator. It is wise to keep guards on hand to capture these monsters and cage them in their weakened state before they run rampant. This Charm can only sustain a maximum of (Essence x 2) demoncreating pits at one time. Creating a new one past this limit terminates the rise of demons from a pit of the warlock's choice, though that site continues to provide locusts.
         With Essence 6+ demons emerge with up to 12 points of positive mutations upgrading them above baseline as a Desecration effect; the exact mutation package is set when the pit is created and can't be altered. From flying blood apes to gargantuan agata troop transports, the possibilities provided by this mutation are only as limited as the Infernal's twisted imagination. With Essence 7+, the pit can spawn a demon every hour instead every night, but this option turns the effect into a Blasphemy.

         Gifts of strength or beauty or wealth may entice mortals, but such enticements do little to snare the Exalted. This Charm extends the scope of Verdant Emptiness Endowment, allowing the warlock to bestow a Charm in lieu of increasing a mundane trait in exchange for a later favor. The bestowed Charm need not be one that the Infernal knows or is even capable of learning, but it must be one that the target is naturally capable of learning and already meets all required trait minimums and prerequisites for. The gift must also fulfill an expressed desire as normal. There is nothing remotely subtle about learning a Charm this way. Old Realm characters conveying the bestowed Charm's nature appear in glowing sand and swirl around the beneficiary. If Exalted, her anima flares iconic.
         There are limits to Gifts of Greater Glory. Charms permitting access to sorcery can only be bestowed on those whom the Storyteller determines has completed the appropriate five trials, while Charms allowing access to necromancy can't be given. Martial Arts Charms require the warlock to know them personally before giving them, an inherent limitation of the Perfected Lotus. Because the gift bypasses training time, a gift of a known Martial Arts Enlightenment Charm can instantly open a Terrestrial's potential to learn Celestial styles. If Gifts of Greater Glory targets oneself, the Infernal owes himself nothing, but gains a number of points of Limit equal to the Charm's minimum Essence. Warlocks with Essence 5+ gain the power to give a sorcery spell to a sorcerer initiated into that spell's circle as per giving a Charm.

         When the Endless Desert makes war, she does so as primal goddess, cataclysmic geography and a limitless horde of demons bound by her law. Even Malfeas is lessser, for his greater might brings him no closer to touching eternity. This Charm reshapes the Infernal in the image of Cecelyne from within a place of physical desolation. As it activates, her body implodes as a tear in space and time, through which the sand of a desert bursts, transforming her anima into a pervasive blight. The violence of the transformation radiates from the Infernal to ravage the area as per the instant duration damaging use of World-Grinding Sandstorm Devastation. Within the cloud of swirling sands, the warlock's Essence expands as an inchoate being of living power. This confers the following:
         • Her body extends as a dematerialized presence through an area a mile across. Her immense size makes attacks by smaller beings undodgeable (without Charms). However, she can't suffer more than one damage level per attack in step 10, unless the attack encompasses at least a tenth of her size. Similarly gargantuan beings ignore these modifiers.
         • In mass combat, she always enjoys the full +3 Magnitude bonus regardless of the Magnitude of the army she faces; only similarly scaled adversaries (again, such as Juggernaut) ignore this bonus.
         • Her senses simultaneously observe from all points within her body as though using All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight (see Exalted, p. 222), though she does not pay attention to all points equally (making stealth possible).
         • She may communicate via Performance out to (Essence) miles, speaking in a gravelly yet silken voice.
         • Characters may deploy social attacks against her from anywhere within her. She may selectively withdraw her attention from areas to perfectly ignore opponents, but this prevents her from observing or acting upon individuals within an ignored area.
         • She can take actions anywhere within her body with her normal traits, paying 3m per action to physically interact with anything corporeal (social attacks cost nothing). Swirls of phantasmal sand form hazy limbs or weapons with which to manipulate the environment. She doesn't gain more actions, nor the capacity to do anything she couldn't do normally. She just has more room to act.
         • The warlock is immune to Poison, Crippling, and non-magical Sickness. She can't starve or suffocate.
         • She may move at her normal movement rate (Dashing and Jumping are impossible), and is immune to Blockade Movement actions.
         • Her body transforms the land she moves upon into desert as a Shaping effect, returning it to normal as she leaves unless she is Essence 6+. The effects of substituting desert terrain are those associated with Holy Land Infliction (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Infernals, p. 125). She may selectively vary the intensity of the perpetual hazard within herself, applying any one of three settings to any area: blistering heat, sandstorm (see Exalted, p. 131), or a supernatural burning sandstorm (Damage 1L/action, Trauma 3).
         • Submerging her fully in liquid or targeting the center of her being with appropriate countermagic (or Adamant Circle Banishing) terminates the Charm. Though Sorcerous, it can be voluntarily deactivated.

         The Ebon Dragon offers no certainty of victory apart from the certainty of an opponent's defeat. Accordingly, the Shadow of All Things lacks a Second Excellency but offers this hateful alternative. Upon witnessing another character perform a valid action within (Essence x 100) yards, the Infernal may spend three motes per -1 external penalty applied to the enemy. This penalty can't exceed the Exalt's Essence by default, but the Infernal's player may describe the target's failure in a way that earns a stunt bonus, and the rating of this stunt adds to the Exalt's Essence rating to determine the maximum penalty. Shadows ooze and lash out from the Infernal's anima to momentarily entwine the victim with obscene tendrils that inflict bad luck and sudden lapses in competence.
         A valid action as defined by this Charm is one that furthers the target's Motivation, supports or protects any of her Intimacies or directly contests the Infernal's own actions, provided the Infernal could enhance her own action with First Ebon Dragon Excellency. Once an Infernal has Essence 3+, she may remove the Obvious keyword from this Charm whenever she activates it.

         The Ebon Dragon is among the greatest liars in history, surpassed only by those Exalted who call themselves heroes. Although Infernal Exalted of both varieties "naturally" exist outside fate as living avatars of Yozi power, such glory ill fits the needs of subtlety. Use of this Charm creates a convincing disguise of a fictitious individual of the Infernal's imagining. Akuma may explicitly impersonate the people they used to be before their damnation.
         Upon activating this Charm by spending (10 - Essence rating) motes, the Infernal's shadow rises up and covers him in liquid darkness. As the shadow melts to its normal configuration a moment later, it leaves the Infernal's body appearing as he desires. The Illusion guise must follow the same basic body plan, though clothes may be included or changed as part of the disguise. Gender does not matter. The disguise is perfectly immune to mundane scrutiny and may not be resisted with Willpower expenditure. Appropriate non-Excellency Charms may pierce the ruse using standard roll-off rules, but the Infernal's player adds (Essence) bonus successes to his roll.
         In addition to providing a disguise, this Charm also supplies a false destiny sufficient to beguile fate as a Shaping effect. For the duration, the character exists inside fate with all concomitant drawbacks and advantages, but any astrological reading of the character's destiny provides whatever information the character chose to include in the false fate at the time of its creation. Some Infernals have been known to leave cryptic messages for one another in their fates as a way of communicating across the world. Whenever the Charm deactivates and the Infernal leaves fate, a random pattern spider in the Loom cries out in horror as it realizes how it has been used.
         Akuma who belong to Yozis other than the Ebon Dragon can explicitly learn this Charm as though it belonged to their patron, but they do so at a price. Because this power is a gift, the Ebon Dragon may terminate it and prevent it from being activated by akuma who displease him, though he holds this as a measure of last resort. He cannot revoke the use of this Charm by anyone else.

      <description>The lies of the Ebon Dragon may fool even magical senses. This Charm is a permanent upgrade to its prerequisite. Whenever it is active, this Charm ensures that the Infernal's magical traits appear to be whatever he wants them to be. If he wishes to appear Essence 1, Essence sight sees him so. If he chooses to conceal that he is a creature of darkness, he can fool the celestial lions guarding the gates of Yu-Shan. If he wishes to seem as though his motes have a Solar aspect, others know this to be so. Overcoming this upgraded Illusion requires the usual means.</description>

         The Ebon Dragon sees through darkness lesser than himself. The Infernal can ignore all penalties and sensory impairment associated with darkness in any form, treating pitch black as though illumined by clear noon. Witness to Darkness grants no additional capability to see through other forms of visual impairment such as fog and smoke. This attunement to darkness has a price, as direct sunlight in Creation imposes a -1 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions.
         Should the Infernal suffer a Crippling effect that blinds her, she may perfectly ignore the effect as a defense to see clearly. However, for as long as this benefit is used, Primordial Essence leaks from the eye (or socket), making this Charm Obvious. The player defines how the leakage manifests.
         Finally, the Infernal is unimpressed with the murk of others' guile and adds her Essence rating to her MDVs against Manipulation-based attacks and as bonus successes to recognize or pierce another's deceptions. Her attunement to lies makes it harder to be honest, however, imposing an internal penalty of her Essence rating to any Charisma-based social attack.

         Monsters lurk in the hearts of men, and not all of them are figurative. This Charm transforms valid targets into members of a First Circle demon race selected when the Infernal purchased this Charm. It may be expanded to include other races if she has spent at least one scene interacting with a member; each species added costs one experience point. Valid targets include any mortal, plus any natural animal that is morphologically similar to the demon race in question (monkeys for Erymanthoi, cats becoming Teodozjia). The target can be no further away than the Infernal's (Essence rating) yards. The Exalt gestures toward the target and lifts her hand, as if bidding a groveling inferior to rise from genuflection.
         The first thing to change is the target's shadow, which looks as though the victim had already become a demon. Roll (Manipulation + Lore) against the target's Dodge MDV. On a failure, the victim recoils against the monstrosity stirred in his heart by regaining one spent Virtue channel of his choice, and his shadow returns to normal. On a success, the victim screams in agony as bones crack and viscera burst from his skin, tearing him asunder and inside out until his shadow properly reflects him. The new demon keeps any superior traits but otherwise has the usual statistics for its race and begins its new existence materialized with an empty Essence pool. It also keeps its memories, Motivation and Intimacies. The Infernal does not control this creature, though it cannot voluntarily attack him in any way until the scene has ended. The demon undergoes a similarly agonizing transformation back to normal when this Charm ends and gains the Creature of Darkness deformity as a permanent Desecration effect.
         When an Infernal with Essence 4 uses this Charm, the resulting demon doesn't change back to its original state until the Infernal desires, up to the beginning of the next Calibration. At Essence 5+, she may use Inner Devils Unchained to spawn a demon from the raw materials of the victim's Essence and memories instead of changing her. In such uses, the duration shortens to Instant since the change is a one-time event rather than an ongoing alteration. The metamorphosis is tantamount to the death of the victim's original form and can't be reversed, since doing so would qualify as resurrection.

         The Ebon Dragon eschews close combat because he is ultimately a coward in spite of his vast power. However, preferences must be set aside in the face of necessity. The Infernal may apply Ebon Dragon Charms that enhance ranged attacks to any close combat attack, provided it meets one or more of these criteria:
         • The Infernal is making a surprise attack.
         • The target has deliberately inflicted levels of lethal or aggravated damage to the Infernal previously in the scene.
         • The target bars the only exit from a place of confinement.
         • It is Calibration.

         The Ebon Dragon has dared behold Oblivion, though each glimpse changes and worsens his nature. The Infernal offers one mote as a sacrifice to Oblivion. Black lightning erupts from her anima and arcs across her, giving her a taste of the ignominy and horror that becoming a Neverborn entails. This experience drains all her motes and Willpower and inflicts sufficient aggravated damage to take the Exalt to Incapacitated (overriding existing damage). More usefully, the magic changes the Infernal into a creature of death and causes her to respire Essence accordingly. Reactivating this Charm reverses its effects, though it hurts just as much the second time around.
         The Infernal may not cast sorcery through the initiation of the Ebon Dragon while a creature of death, but the first two circles provide temporary initiation into Iron and Onyx Circle necromancy, respectively. She may learn spells of those circles and apply the usual bonuses of the Ebon Dragon's initiation. Sorcerous initiations of other Yozis remain unaffected and function normally. Switching back to living Essence restores the Ebon Dragon's sorcery Charms to normal operation and makes necromancy spells unavailable.

         The Ebon Dragon takes the sight of others to enhance his glory. This Charm may enhance any physical attack, causing it to trail eddies of liquid darkness as it strikes. Roll the Infernal's (Manipulation + Presence). Any target who is hit by the attack and has a (higher of Perception and Awareness) rating less than the number of successes rolled suffers complete blindness for the rest of the scene. Rules for blindness may be found on page 152 of Exalted. The eyes of victims blinded this way darken to pure black without whites or irises, through which they see the Ebon Dragon in all his dark majesty and nothing else.
         If the Infernal has Essence 4+, imposed blindness takes the form of a Desecration effect that simultaneously bestows the Creature of Darkness deformity (if needed) and the Blindness debility. Emerald Circle Countermagic can still remove blindness imposed this way, though the Creature of Darkness deformity remains.

      <description>The Ebon Dragon does not really understand heroism save through understanding its absence. This Charm may be activated whenever the Infernal observes a rolled action take place within 10 yards. If the targeted action is enhanced with a two- or three-point stunt or a Virtue channel, the roll is made at the normal target number, negating the effect of this Charm. If the targeted action is enhanced by a one-point stunt, its target number increases by 1 (normally 8). With no stunt at all, the target number increases by 2 (normally 9).</description>

Whenever an Infernal uses one or more Infernal Charms to enhance or constitute a physical attack and that attack misses its target, the Infernal may reflexively spend one Willpower to regain all motes spent to activate one attack Charm of her choice. This negates all effects of its activation. This power may only be used once per tick. An attack that hits and fails to do damage is ineligible for mote recovery with this Charm.</description>

         The Ebon Dragon's nature is to serve himself, first, foremost and generally exclusively. To the degree that anyone else profits from interaction with him, it is only because he profits more. The closest he comes to benevolence is allowing others to enjoy the crumbs of his victory or in giving what he does not wish to keep. The Infernal enchants his ego to guide and empower his behavior. Through this awareness, he can automatically judge the benefits of doing anything, provided he has any chance of arriving at that conclusion as a result of gaining a threshold of five on a successful roll using any Ability.
         Additionally, whenever the character takes an action that directly helps himself at the expense of others, the stunt rating of the action increases by one as though it resonated with the character's Motivation. This can explicitly grant a one-point stunt to an action than did not qualify for a stunt. However, the character is considered a creature of darkness for the duration of the effect if not already. This status abates when the Charm ends. Taking an action that grants more benefit to others than himself drains three motes from the Infernal, while an action that helps others in any significant way without offering some reward drains 10 motes. This drain goes into effect only if the action succeeds. Selfishness Is Power can't be deactivated prior to running its full duration, so it must be used carefully.
         A second purchase of this Charm allows its effects to be bestowed on someone else as a Touch effect, paying four motes. The Infernal must maintain a separate commitment for each being empowered this way. Mortals gain the same artificial stunt bonus, but actions that would drain three motes drain one Willpower instead, while 10-mote actions inflict three levels of unsoakable lethal damage to the character as punishment for imprudent generosity. Damage inflicted this way attacks the life force directly without wounding the body in any way diagnosable by mundane medicine. Characters receive no warning ahead of these punishments, but the Charm becomes Obvious to them without revealing its source as soon as any punishment takes place. If desired, the effect can be Obvious to the target (and no one else) from the beginning. Otherwise, mortal extras can only hope that they do something to lose Willpower before kindness kills them. An activation that targets someone else may be terminated at will.
         A third purchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ permits (but does not force) the Infernal to place a more durable enchantment on others with Indefinite duration. Such magic is Sorcerous and explicitly vulnerable to Emerald Countermagic. Damage from the extended curse is bashing and will never reduce the victim below Incapacitated. Leaders of social or martial units enchanted this way consider benefit to themselves, not the organization as extensions of themselves.

      <description>The Ebon Dragon would transform all life into his own image, a universe of hollowed shadows. This Charm can enhance any ranged attack. Any living being hit by the attack suffers (Infernal's Willpower) lethal dice of piercing damage, resolved separately from and prior to any damage from the attack itself. Every level of damage, not including Dying levels, inflicted on a being this way restores one mote to the Infernal's Essence pool. If the attack harms multiple beings, only the highest Essence yield for any one victim provides motes.</description>

      <description>The Ebon Dragon is spiteful and refuses to let enemies escape. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm activates its prerequisite, she may pay an additional one Willpower to worsen its power. If the Charm inflicts any damage, the Essence of the attack lingers in the wound as a disruptive Poison effect formed entirely of tenebrous Essence rather than matter. On the following tick, the character suffers the same raw damage as the raw damage from Life-Blighting Emptiness Attack, but this injury bypasses armor entirely rather than being merely piercing.</description>

         The Ebon Dragon does not accept that life is hope. His curses prove otherwise. The character must choose a living being within sensory range that he inflicted damage upon earlier in the scene. Until the scene ends, the target can't heal damage by any means, including effects that convert injuries to less serious types of damage (lethal to bashing, etc.). Whenever a wound would heal and does not, black Essence oozes like tar from it instead, making the curse Obvious. If the Charm is dispelled, the vile secretions combust in a single flare of green fire, inflicting one die of lethal damage that ignores armor but also renders the target immune to further activations of this Charm for the rest of the scene. Charms that build on Life-Denying Hate as a prerequisite with similar effects do not stack the damage burst for being dispelled.
         Whenever a spirit cursed by this Charm dies, Soul-Absorbing Barrage shunts the spirit into darkness beyond existence unless it perishes exposed to sunlight. Within this oubliette of perfect solitude, the spirit experiences the passage of time and nothing else, forever. From time to time, the Infernal dreams of the exiled spirit's pain, but the exile is functionally annihilated from the perspective of Creation and ceases to be a valid target for effects.
         Essence 4+ Infernals may purchase this Charm a second time, in which case the curse lasts until dispelled but remains vulnerable to Emerald Circle Countermagic. A third and final purchase at Essence 7+ upgrades the curse to require Sapphire Circle Countermagic for removal.

      <description>It is not such a leap to go from denying healing to denying Essence recovery. This Charm follows all of the same rules as its prerequisite but inhibits mote recovery by any means save stunts rather than regeneration. A black tear trickles from the corner of the victim's eyes whenever she should gain a mote and does not. A second and final purchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ extends the duration to one day.</description>

         The Ebon Dragon defeats adversaries by becoming their perfect antithesis. The Infernal chooses a living being he can perceive within (Essence rating) yards. The Exalt's Motivation changes to some antagonistic opposite of the target's own Motivation as a Shaping effect (so the target's "Defend the Realm" could change the Infernal to "Destroy the Realm" or "Corrupt the Realm"). Akuma temporarily gain this Motivation in addition to their Urge but can only select a character presenting a known obstacle to their Urge as a target for this Charm.
         The Infernal knows the Motivation of the target. If that Motivation changes while the Charm remains active, the Infernal automatically shifts to oppose this new goal. When this Charm ends, the Exalt's Motivation reverts to what it was previously. The death of the enemy automatically ends the Charm. Completing the new Motivation also ends the Charm but doesn't afford a chance to bypass training time for raising Essence unless the target has an Essence rating greater than or equal to that of the Infernal.
         This Charm also creates an Intimacy of spiteful hate in the Infernal toward the Charm's target. This Intimacy is inviolate while the Charm remains active.
         Whenever the Infernal witnesses a social attack against the Charm's target that is aided or inhibited by one of the target's Intimacies, he recognizes this fact but does not know any details about the Intimacy. By reflexively spending one mote (which is not a Charm activation), the Infernal knows the Intimacy and instantly gains an Intimacy to the same subject with an opposing emotional context.
         Infernals who learn and use Black Mirror Shintai (see page 154-155) automatically and reflexively reactivate Nemesis Self Imagined Anew when they cease mirroring a target. This does not require a Charm activation or follow normal range restrictions.

         The Ebon Dragon delights in taking advantage of an enemy's weakness. This Charm may enhance any attempt at mental influence toward a character the Infernal has mirrored with Nemesis Self Imagined Anew, making that influence unnatural. If the influence preys on one of the target's Intimacies, the roll to impose the influence is made at target number 6. Influence that preys on Motivation uses target number 5. If the influence attacks Motivation through an Intimacy, the target's MDV is halved (rounded down), and the roll is made at target number 4.
         The Ultimate Darkness believes no happiness or love is unsullied by bitterness. Essence 3+ Infernals who purchase this Charm a second time gain the benefits of preying on Intimacies and/or Motivation if the influence normally would be resisted by such traits (-3 MDV and target number 5 for attacking a Motivation, for example). The victim must still spend Willpower to resist a successful social attack that goes against his Motivation.

         To properly oppose an enemy, the Shadow of All Things must learn to fight as that enemy does. This Charm may only be activated while Nemesis Self Imagined Anew is active. Doing so reveals what Abilities the target has with a higher rating than the Infernal but doesn't reveal the actual ratings of these traits. He may choose any such Ability and temporarily gains one dot of that trait. Subsequent activations can stack additional bonus dots onto the same or different valid Abilities, up to the Infernal's usual maximum for that trait. Costs for raising traits boosted through this Charm are based on the Infernal's normal rating but ignore training times.
         A second purchase of this Charm extends the scope of traits it can mimic to Attributes (for a cost of six motes per dot gained) and permanent Willpower (for a cost of five motes per dot gained). The latter use does not provide additional temporary Willpower on activation.
         A third purchase at Essence 4+ allows the character to copy one of the target's Charms for six motes. Charms that provide additional Essence reserves can't be copied. The Infernal can only choose a Charm that the target has used previously in the scene, though not necessarily via activation. For example, Ox-Body Technique is always in use. At the time of use, the target must have been within (Essence x 5) yards of the Infernal, and the Charm must have been Obvious to the Infernal's senses at the time of use. The copied Charm must be one that the character is capable of learning and for which he has all necessary prerequisites and minimum traits.
         Green Sun Princes of the Fiend Caste may draw upon their anima power to broaden the scope of Charms they can copy with the third purchase of Puissance Mimicry Intuition, though Charms that can only be gained this way cost seven motes apiece. Non-Fiends may copy foreign Charms at Essence 5+ but lack the power to permanently retain such magic with experience. The Storyteller may veto or limit any Charm acquisitions that present unforeseen problems or imbalances.

         The Ebon Dragon is not the mightiest Yozi, nor the most brilliant. Neither is he the most creative or cunning of the titans. However, no other Primordial approaches his skill at cheating. Among the Exalted, the Sidereals have come the closest to understanding his principle of antagonistic cheating and fashioned Obsidian Shards of Infinity Style in the likeness of his unfairness, but how well they succeeded remains as unclear to the art's masters as those unfortunate enough to encounter them. The Shadow of All Things disdains their unintended offering as unworthy, but gratitude must never be his nature. Purer understanding of the Yozi reveals that the mirror of adversity does not exist outside the self, but pretends to exist within.
         Black Mirror Shintai may only be activated if Nemesis Self Imagined Anew is active and its target is of equal or lesser Essence (and not, at the Storyteller's discretion, significantly more powerful than its Essence indicates, like many behemoths). Wherever that target is, her shadow flickers and vanishes, reappearing as a second skin of liquid darkness that envelops the Infernal in the span of a heartbeat. Within this chrysalis, the Infernal's flesh, soul and Essence undergo an agonizing metamorphosis that leaves the Exalt paralyzed and unable to defend until his next action. The cocoon bursts when his DV refreshes, revealing that the character has been changed into an exact replica of the target, though the target still doesn't cast a shadow while this Charm remains active.
         While duplicating another character, the Infernal loses all traits of his own and gains all the target's traits, as if he swapped out his character sheet for a copy of the target's. Equipment and clothing does not change with him, with all artifacts losing attunement as a result of the change. All ongoing Charm and spell effects applying to him end as though negated and/or dispelled as appropriate, releasing all relevant mote commitments with no refund. Black Mirror Shintai doesn't break its own effects, though it does cloak itself from all known forms of Essence sight.
         Backgrounds do not copy unless they represent an internal quality of the character rather than an external socioeconomic advantage, such as Breeding, Heart's Blood, Savant, Solar Bond, Whispers, etc. While artifacts do not copy, the panoply of a demon or god does. The character retains his memories and sense of self except to the degree that shifts in Virtues, Intimacies and Motivation adjust his behavior. Mimicking a god makes that god's sanctum the character's own sanctum for the duration; the Storyteller may confer other such perks as appropriate to the target.
         The mirroring provided by this Charm stays up-to-date with the target's permanent trait shifts. The Infernal cannot modify his stolen traits in any permanent fashion. This includes spending experience or permanent traits to pay costs, like a spirit's Endowment.
         Although the transformed Infernal remains a creature of darkness and native of Malfeas, he is not actually an Infernal for the duration, but is instead whatever he mimics. Thus, in copying a Dragon-Blood, he is temporarily a Terrestrial Exalt and may do things such as use Reflexive Charms at will. Becoming a Sidereal lets him use astrology and Sidereal Martial arts, etc. The character's Motivation and Intimacies are antithetical to the target's goals rather than being exact duplicates, as per traits conferred by Nemesis Self Imagined Anew. Temporary traits remain as they are (health, Willpower points, motes, Virtue channels) but adjust to fit the new pool sizes allowed for them. For health, apply current damage to the new health level track (this can kill a character who changes to a form with fewer health levels). For other temporary traits, if the character shifts to a form that has smaller pools, he retains his current value, but once this excess is spent, it is gone, and the character remains limited by the current form. This conversion also applies when changing back to normal.
         Because the character is an exact duplicate of his enemy, he perfectly succeeds on all attempts to impersonate that character. His fate is the fate of the enemy he mirrors, save that any divination of location reveals the target to be in two locations at once. Due to the entanglement of fate, the target's Cult rating also copies like an internal Background, as prayers do not know where to go and thus empower the original and copy alike. Arcane links to the copied character transmit both. Attempts to divine the Infernal's existence or location with any magic while he is someone else fail, revealing that he does not exist.
         The Shaping transformation wrought by this Charm lasts only one day by default, though it can be terminated as a reflexive action. All ongoing Charm, astrology and spell effects applying to him end as though negated and/or dispelled as appropriate, releasing all relevant mote commitments. Impossible states also terminate, so if sorcerously bound as a demon, the binding ends when the Infernal becomes himself once more. Adamant or Obsidian Circle Countermagic also returns him to normal against his will. The death of the target does not terminate the effect. If the Infernal dies, he chooses whether his corpse reverts back to its true form or not.
         A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 6+ extends its duration to Indefinite, allowing the transformation to last until deliberately revoked or dispelled.

         From his thrashing imprisonment to present, the Ebon Dragon has tirelessly and furiously labored to shatter the walls of his prison. This Charm may supplement any action that directly helps an Infernal escape physical restraints or physical confinement. Note that this Charm only aids in direct personal escape efforts; it can help an Exalt seduce a guard to get out of jail, but it won't help her shatter the prison wall from the outside to set other captives free. As always, the Storyteller remains the final arbiter of when this Charm applies. Cracked Cell Circumvention doubles the successes of any valid action (or doubles the size of a static pool). If used to enhance an attack, the accuracy successes double before applying the target's DV (or MDV), but this does not also double damage successes.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may spend an additional Willpower when activating this Charm in order to ensure a threshold one success on the enhanced action as a Shaping effect. The character can't use this effect to destroy magical objects, but she may augment actions that circumvent such barriers nondestructively. Using this effect to escape a clinch breaks the hold immediately.

      <description>When the need is dire enough, Infernals with this Charm may warp the flow of destiny around their Yozi power. This reduces the target number of all Attribute and/or Ability rolls the Infernal makes for the rest of the scene by -1 (typically to target number 6). Unrolled actions are not affected. Such manipulations are not without consequence, however. Once the scene ends, all of the character's rolled actions are at +1 target number (usually 8) until a full day has passed. He may not reactivate this Charm until the backlash subsides. The Shaping distortion in fate created by this Charm is localized enough that it does not reverberate through the Tapestry as a Blasphemy effect, but its use is considered Obvious to all Sidereal Exalted and gods of the Bureau of Destiny.</description>

         The Ebon Dragon can bend the destiny of others as readily as he distorts his own future. By touching another character, the Infernal grants them all of the positive and negative effects of having activated Fate-Rending Desperation. Neither that Charm nor Unfair Excellence Endowment may be applied to a target who is suffering inauspicious backlash from either.
         If the Infernal has Essence 4+, she may extend her tainted blessing to any number of targets within a five-yard radius of herself using a single activation of Fate-Rending Desperation, not including herself. No physical contact is necessary, but the unblockable touch attack roll should be compared to the Dodge DV of every character who attempts to get out of the way. Those who fail to move quickly enough watch as wisps of black vapor ooze from the Infernal's anima and force themselves into the eyes and mouths of all affected as an Obvious effect. Once active, the ongoing effect is only Obvious to the Bureau of Destiny as noted in Fate-Rending Desperation.
         With Essence 4+, the Infernal gains the ability to build a "trigger condition" into each activation of the Charm, allowing it to wait for some set of circumstances to occur before the blessing begins. These conditions must be something the Infernal could sense with her normal senses, though she does not have to be present to bear actual witness. It is not possible to "hang" multiple destiny warps on one target.

      <description>The Ebon Dragon cannot help but understand the hateful terms of his imprisonment any more than he can choose to accept that imprisonment. For five motes, this Charm makes all unnatural mental influence currently affecting the Infernal Obvious to her senses. She may choose one of them to resist by paying Willpower points equal to the minimum Essence required for the Charm, spell or other power causing the influence (maximum five Willpower). If this value is not provided, the Storyteller should assign a cost from one to five Willpower based on the effect's relative power. The Infernal may not use this Charm to resist effects with a Willpower cost exceeding her Integrity rating. Upon successful payment, this Charm immediately terminates the offending influence. No force can prevent a character from using this Charm.</description>

      <description>The Ebon Dragon has no form of his own under all his stolen shadows. This Charm provides a perfect dodge against any physical attack the Infernal can perceive, even undodgeable attacks. Rather than moving aside in a conventional sense, the Exalt's body and possessions dissolve into tarry, writhing shadows that immediately congeal back to normal anywhere within (temporary Willpower points remaining) yards. This sudden movement cannot pass through solid objects, though the slightest crack in a wall allows the Infernal's liquid self to slip through the chink. This Charm is vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Shadow of All Things.</description>

         The surest way for Creation to fall into the state of wicked depravity that is most pleasing to the Ebon Dragon is for good men to do nothing, and the Shadow of All Things is more than ready to promote such inaction. To use this Charm, the warlock must touch a witness to an act of depravity, or to evidence of such an act. Henceforth, the target's mind is filled with paralyzing shame and horror when she considers relating what she has seen to any other character, either through speech or writing, forcing her to ultimately remain silent. This unnatural mental influence costs 3 Willpower to resist. The warlock must be aware that the witness has beheld a specific depravity, and may not blindly 'guess' when activating Our Little Secret. Multiple activations of this Charm may be placed on the same witness, to force silence on the subject of multiple valid acts.
         An act of depravity is defined as any act which would cause shock, outrage, or scandal according to the common mores of Creation's dominant culture (currently the Realm) or the dominant culture in which the act occurs. Murder, adultery, rape, incest, theft, violent assault and disrespect toward the Terrestrial Exalted on the part of mortals are all examples of acts of depravity within the Realm, and are thus applicable wherever the Charm is used. More specific acts of depravity might include rudeness to an Essence 6+ divinity (if the Charm were used in Yu-Shan), enslavement of citizens of Nexus (if used in Nexus), or disobeying a superior officer (if used in Lookshy).
         At Essence 3+, the Infernal may touch a piece of evidence related to an act of depravity rather than a witness, for a cost of 8m rather than 4m. This causes all individuals who subsequently witness the evidence so marked to be forced into silence as though they had been targeted with the 4m activation of Our Little Secret, as a Sorcerous effect.
         With Essence 4+, the Charm's Compulsion is enhanced to also include a prohibition against moving or disturbing evidence of an act of depravity. For example, a character who found a mutilated body deep in the woods would not only be powerless to speak of his discovery, but also could not bring himself to give the corpse a proper burial or even to drag it back to town to be anonymously discovered and properly disposed of by others.

         The Ebon Dragon is unsatisfied with ruining the present and future. He has to desecrate the past as well. Why else would he invent fate but to spread misery to all time and space? This Charm augments a Manipulation-based social attack targeting one victim (i.e. most likely using Investigation or Presence) in which the Infernal verbally prompts the target to recall positive memories associated with a particular time or subject. "Remember your wedding night?" and "Congratulations on your promotion!" are both examples of valid triggers. The memory need not be wholly positive to be targeted, so long as there is some good part to destroy. The Infernal can word the attack so that it ironically validates the positive nature of the memory while actually calling attention to the negative details surrounding it. Regardless of whether the social attack forces an answer or not, the victim vividly relives the targeted experience within her own mind.
         Unfortunately for the victim, the Ebon Dragon's power obscures and distorts the fond memory even as she recalls it. If the roll overcomes the target's MDV, the warlock ruins the memory. If the Storyteller determines the target has no positive memories to recall about the chosen topic, the Charm has no effect.
         Victims misremember ruined memories in the worst possible light, glossing over or outright forgetting everything good about the experience in question. Everything bad is remembered in exacting and often exaggerated detail. The victim thinks the worst of all other participants in the remembered experience, especially anyone whom she can blame for any harm she suffered (however slight). A mother could misremember her dead son as a lazy good-for-nothing who talked back, forgetting that she also loved him and he loved her. Corrupted memories never introduce outright falsehoods. The mother remembers her son's laziness because he was sometimes lazy and remembers that he talked back because most children do. She does not remember him torturing small animals because that never happened. Thankfully for the Ebon Dragon, everyone is flawed. In that at least, Creation functions as designed.
         Ruining memories interferes with Intimacies toward the subject of those memories. If the victim has no such Intimacy, then a negative Intimacy instantly forms toward that subject. Any existing positive Intimacy warps into a negative Intimacy. In either case, the victim's player chooses the Intimacy's new emotional context, subject to Storyteller approval. For instance, the aforementioned mother may feel resentment toward her son or hatred or contempt.
         Corrupted memories are an unnatural Illusion effect. The victim can repair her damaged mind by paying one Willpower if she had no Intimacy toward the subject of the memory when the Infernal used Golden Years Tarnished Black or two Willpower if the Charm corrupted a positive Intimacy. This may seem counterintuitive given that a positive Intimacy helps defend against the Charm, but if the accursed magic takes root in spite of this bonus, the feelings turn cancerous and become a liability. The victim can pay this Willpower to heal the memory in the moment the Charm takes root (which also prevents the Intimacy from forming or being corrupted), but if she does not do so, she must wait until externally prompted or provide a compelling Storyteller-approved reason to question the memory.
         Intimacies formed or corrupted by this Charm do not count against the usual limit a mind can sustain, at least so long as the associated memories remain corrupted. After all, the Ebon Dragon wouldn't want his enemies getting over their misery just because life went on. Once the memory heals, the Intimacy falls away as normal if neglected. Even without such healing, it is still possible to remove the Intimacy through normal means other than neglect.
         A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 3+ allows it to enhance Performance-based spoken attacks as an alternative to the basic single-target use. In doing so, the Infernal picks a single topic and all listeners react to the Charm as though separately targeted by the address. The corruptive mass oratory has no effect on listeners lacking appropriate memories to subvert.

         The Ebon Dragon isn't thoughtlessly cruel like his siblings, indifferent to the suffering he brings to lesser beings. The Ultimate Darkness has more heart than that, honoring the most fragile child with the same diligent attention he would pay to a god or titan. He fairly ensures that all suffer unfairly. Still, it cannot really be said that all victims are alike to him. Purchase of this Charm permanently removes the Willpower cost to activate Golden Years Tarnished Black whenever the target is a single mortal, natural animal or Essence 1 magical being.
         With Essence 4+, this Charm adds First Circle demons to the list of cost-discounted victims. Furthermore, the base mote cost to target anything on the list becomes the target's lowest Virtue or highest Virtue (respectively) depending on whether the target is an extra or not. Surcharges and discounts from other effects modify this new base cost normally, with the former applied before the latter.

         As much fun as it can be to invert love into hate, there are other ways to ruin a memory. This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. By paying an extra mote while using that Charm, the Infernal seeks a different outcome. Ruining a memory doesn't take away the pleasure of it. Quite to the contrary, the subject gains fetishistic appeal that is at once a source of titillation and shame. This induced desire results in a positive Intimacy of addiction toward the subject (possibly overriding an existing positive Intimacy with another emotional context). Healing this variant of memory damage and Intimacy gain requires the same process as the basic function of Golden Years Tarnished Black.
         With Essence 3+, Want Becomes Need does more than distort memory and foster shame-poisoned longings for remembered joys. If the attack succeeds, the twisted memory and poisonous Intimacy join together to addict her soul. Most victims suffer an unnatural Compulsion duplicating a constant partially-controlled Overindulgence Limit Break (Exalted, p. 105), though they may take scant consolation that the behavior is solely limited to the subject of the altered memories/Intimacy and does not predispose them to other vices. Victims can pay one Willpower to suppress this addictive behavior for one day. Victims with Limit tracks can choose to gain one Limit instead of paying Willpower to ignore the addiction for a day. If this results in madness wholly unconnected to addiction, well, Exalted are strange creatures.
         The addictive Compulsion instilled by Want Becomes Need  is predicated on both the memory distortion and the associated Intimacy. If either is removed or meaningfully altered at any point (as determined by the Storyteller), the addiction instantly terminates and never comes back without further use of Want Becomes Need.

         While the Ebon Dragon stands to gain more from ruining beautiful memories than further sullying painful recollections, he believes he can always find a way to worsen the world. After all, he always has so far. Purchase of this Charm broadens the utility of its prerequisite in the following ways:
         • The Charm can target memories that don't have a meaningful positive component to them. There's not much silver lining to "That day you watched your little girl die in front of your eyes". When a bad memory is made worse this way, every pain associated with that memory becomes accentuated and exaggerated. A soldier remembers the fateful day his legion fell in battle against the Anathema as if it happened only yesterday. He remembers the sound of his friends' screams, the awful crunch of their bones and the shocked look as the newest recruit tried vainly to stuff his entrails back into his body after the monster eviscerated him with a backhanded slap. He remembers the stink of blood and offal and rancid sweat. Absence of a negative Intimacy creates one in the victim with a Stoyteller-approved emotional context picked by the victim's player.
         • At the Infernal's discretion, part of the imposed memory distortion can involve reassignment of blame to a target of the warlock's choosing. The victim's player can choose any Storyteller-approved chain of logic to justify this new opinion, however twisted and tangled. If the Storyteller cannot construct such a narrative because there is simply no way the new scapegoat could be responsible, the attack automatically fails. Still, this offers immense latitude. A child can construct a dozen reasons why it is her fault that her father abandoned her and her mother. If only she had been better behaved or told her daddy how much she loved him, he wouldn't have gone away.
         • If the Infernal knows the Charm Weak Minds Believe Anything, he receives additional benefit when making a discount-cost victim believe she is the ultimate cause of her own suffering as explained previously. Such victims also lose (6 - the Infernal's Compassion) additional Willpower as the memory twists. If this depletes all of an extra's remaining Willpower, that victim's will breaks and she attempts to kills herself from shame and self-loathing at every opportunity for one day. If she survives due to the intervention of others, the urge passes. Despair wrought by this unnatural Compulsion is explicitly capable of overriding a target's survival instinct, thereby issuing the unstated and normally unacceptable order to commit suicide. The souls of victims who kill themselves as a result of Everything Gets Worse fall straight into Oblivion barring other magic that forces them to linger as a ghost or pass into Lethe. Much to the Ebon Dragon's frustration, annihilation trumps his Charms to banish souls into the darkness beyond existence. He has yet to find a way to inflict absolute despair for eternity, though not for lack of trying.

         The Ebon Dragon knows his own nature well enough to realize he is too often distracted tormenting individuals to properly damn the universe. Accordingly, he sends forth blasphemous revisionist texts into Creation as messengers of his lies. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Infernal permanently gains the power to use Golden Years Tarnished Black to enhance written social attacks matching the Charm's basic spoken use.
         All that is necessary is for the words to clearly invoke the intended topic. Terse graffiti is just as useful for delivering the attack as a lengthier project like a novel or history textbook. Both Presence and Performance-based attacks are permissible, with the latter taking the form of general addresses to any reader. Text enchanted with this Charm is no more physically durable than normal, so fire remains an excellent countermeasure to most cursed writing.
         The magic within the words is also a Sorcerous effect and can be dispelled as such, causing the text to fade away as though never written. Even stone tablets become unmarred and smooth once more as chiseled words disappear. Few realize that the empty page is the truest and most eloquent scripture of the Ebon Dragon. Of all his lies, the titan's insistence that he exists is the most audacious and preposterous.

         With greater attunement to the Ebon Dragon comes greater power to attack the sanctity of treasured memories. The slight catch is that power is slavery. Those who can sabotage memories adroitly find themselves compelled to do so. This Charm permanently modifies its prerequisite as follows:
         • A social attack enhanced by the Charm adds a number of bonus dice equal to the Infernal's Essence. These are dice added by a Charm and count toward those limits.
         • The base cost to heal memories damaged by each activation of this Charm increases to three Willpower. If the memory corrupted a positive Intimacy, the cost rises even further to (Infernal's Essence rating, maximum five) Willpower. The victim still can only spend Willpower to heal a memory in the moment the Infernal attacks or in response to plausible prompting (such as encountering evidence that contradicts recollection).
         • Upon overhearing a non-extra speaking of a treasured memory, the Infernal must use his next available action to attack the memory with Golden Years Tarnished Black unless he can't pay the cost to do so. He may use the Charm any way he knows how (such as creating an addiction via Want Becomes Need) and needn't stick to just ruining memories. If he doesn't attack the memory in question, he gains a point of Limit unless he has already gained Limit this way previously in the day. This mad need to taint others doesn't apply if the Infernal has no opportunity to react that way. Limit is not gained from hearing a memory relayed by an Infallible Messenger sent halfway around the world. Likewise, Limit isn't gained if the Infernal can't make social attacks for any reason, such as due to being bound and gagged. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the final arbiter, but should consider whether the character made a good faith effort to attack a cherished memory when given a reasonable chance to do so.

      <description>The Ebon Dragon does not permit his enemies to recover the truths his awful power rots from within. This Charm permanently upgrades Golden Years Tarnished Black. Whenever the Infernal activates that Charm to enhance a spoken attack against a single target, he can choose to pay an additional two motes to make his words Sorcerous. If the attack successfully overcomes the victim's MDV and corrupts her memory, then she can't heal this damage via Willpower expenditure - not even to reject the corruption in the moment of the attack. Spending the Willpower normally needed to fix the memory does allow the victim to become suspicious that her recollection may be wrong, though not how or why. Methods of breaking mental influence other than spending Willpower work normally on Sorcerous invocations of Golden Years Tarnished Black, such as the Solar Charm Transcendent Hero's Meditation (Exalted, p. 201). Appropriate countermagic also works to reverse the Charm's effects.</description>

         There is little point in twisting a couple's love into hate if they turn right around and make up a week later. That just simply won't do. Fortunately, the Ebon Dragon long ago planned for such contingencies.
         Golden Years Tarnished Black already bolsters the Intimacies it creates and corrupts, exempting them from usual Intimacy total maximums. Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction further enchants these Intimacies to resist removal. All of the following powers instantly terminate if the associated memory heals, leaving behind a perfectly normal non-magical Intimacy.
         • The victim must resist any external attempt to damage enchanted Intimacies via mental influence with the best non-magical defenses available to her. Generally speaking, that means using her highest MDV and paying Willpower at every opportunity. If the influence succeeds in spite of her best effort, the effect resolves normally. Victims can pay five Willpower to forgo the defense mandated by this unnatural Emotion and Servitude effect, but must pay this exorbitant cost each time they wish to lower their mental guard against a social attack or other source of mental influence. Most victims find this urge too strong to fight and instead focus their efforts on fixing their memories or ridding themselves of the offending Intimacy.
         • The victim cannot voluntarily take actions that would erode the Intimacy (as determined by the Storyteller). She can pay one Willpower per scene to suppress this unnatural Emotion and Servitude effect so that she can work toward freeing herself from the unwanted feelings.
         • The victim's sleep is troubled with brooding nightmares about her damaged memories. Every time she regains Willpower points from sleep, she is considered to have spent that many scenes repairing the Intimacy of any damage done to it. In effect, the emotional pollution regenerates by feeding upon the suffering buried in her subconscious. If the Intimacy is actually removed, the feelings behind it die and cease regenerating.

         Sometimes the Ebon Dragon is best served by whiter lies than himself, veiling inconvenient truths behind the mists of nostalgia. By paying an extra mote while using Golden Years Tarnished Black, the Infernal ruins the targeted memory in a much more unorthodox manner. The victim retains and idealizes everything she finds good about the memory. At the same time, she forgets everything bad about the topic and/or minimizes the importance of bad elements as the Infernal chooses. For example, an aging Dynast can be made to remember the reign of the Scarlet Empress as a halcyon time of justice and peace, completely overlooking the tyranny and oppression of her totalitarian regime. A molested child can be made to adore her father once more. Most usefully, the Infernal can help a mortal enemy remember how much she enjoys his charming company and flattering praise, never mind those times he slept with her daughter, murdered her husband and burned down her house.
         If the victim doesn't already have a positive Intimacy to a particular memory, whitewashing the recollection with Glories That Never Were instantly creates such an Intimacy with a Storyteller-approved emotional context chosen by the victim's player. An existing positive Intimacy becomes enchanted by the Charm. Healing memory damage and Intimacy gain inflicted by Glories That Never Were generally requires the same process as the basic function of Golden Years Tarnished Black (as modified by Unreasoning Prejudice Infliction). However, victims also add half their Willpower rating as an MDV bonus to resist all external attempts to weaken or remove the Intimacy associated with an idealized memory. This bonus reflects the way minds doggedly cling to delusions of better times in the bleak world that is Creation. Hope is often all people have, however false.
         With Essence 4+, Glories That Never Were gets worse. If the bolstered positive Intimacy is removed by any means while its associated memory remains damaged, the victim experiences a sudden wave of despair as she comprehends the inherent ugliness of truth. This overreaction drags her mind to the opposite extreme like a swinging pendulum, changing the way her memories distort to match the base ruin inflicted by Golden Years Tarnished Black. What was pure good becomes hateful. Furthermore, a new enchanted Intimacy instantly forms toward the subject as per all rules of Golden Years Tarnished Black.

         The Ultimate Darkness preys upon the vile feelings that seep from wounded memories. Such emotions are but a shadow of the Dragon, and so they rightly yield before their master and betray the heart that holds them. This Charm can enhance any social attack aimed at a single target (typically with Investigation or Presence), provided the attack preys upon an Intimacy created or corrupted by Golden Years Tarnished Black. For instance, if the warlock caused a widow to despise her late husband, he could then attempt to prey upon that hate by suggesting she should set fire to all the art he painted as his life's work. Instead of the usual -1 MDV modifier, the social attack becomes unnatural (if not already) and unexpected, costing one additional Willpower to resist at each opportunity to do so (to a maximum of five Willpower as normal).
         If the Infernal has Essence 7+, Dark Claws Seize Dark Hearts may also be used to augment Performance-based social attacks as an alternative to single target use. Such attacks work on all listeners, but the benefits of the Charm (unexpected, automatically unnatural, etc.) only apply against those with appropriate Intimacies.

         The Primordials built Creation. Compared with this feat, the transubstantiation of one object into another is relatively trivial. This Charm can only target non-magical inanimate objects. The Infernal pays one Willpower plus motes equal to twice the target's Resources value, then his player rolls (Manipulation + Lore) roll at a difficulty of the object's value. If this roll fails or botches, the target transforms into something unexpected and abhorrent of the Storyteller's choosing. The misshapen prodigies of such accidents aren't valid targets for this Charm and rarely have any monetary value or practical use, save perhaps as ugly decorations or random occult ingredients. Success envelops the object in coils of caustic energy, gruesomely melting and realigning its motonic structure to become any other non-magical inanimate object of equal or lesser Resources cost. Dissolving an opponent's weapon into goo or turning a suit of armor to dust (resulting in Resources 0 items) is a valid use of this Charm. Infernals can't make Resources 1+ objects they aren't familiar with, defined as spending a minimum of one scene studying or using such an item.
         Although casual inspection reveals nothing unusual about transformed items, trained savants can recognize subtle hints of Yozi aesthetics in the objects with a difficulty 5 (Perception + Occult) roll. Furthermore, the objects lose stability after a number of months equal to their new Resources value, warping as per a failed activation roll. If countermagic dispels this Charm's effects prior to this dissolution, the object returns to its original state.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may simultaneously warp any number of valid targets within a radius of (Essence) yards around themselves without needing actual touch, provided they own all of those items. The difficulty for this feat is the highest difficulty for any targeted object. Small groups of related items may be changed together as a single item with Storyteller permission, such as transmuting one outfit into another. Further explanation on the limits of what is considered an object may be found on page 213 of Exalted.

         The worst cruelty the Exalted inflicted on the Primordials was forcing the humiliated titans to pay attention to their conquerors and care about them in the ways that they never thought about vermin. Turnabout is fair play. This Charm is an unnatural and unblockable social attack directed at a single target using a dice pool of (Manipulation + Presence + Essence). No actual communication takes place, as the magic reaches directly into the target's soul to poison her heart without regard for language barriers. Conventional senses cannot detect this assault, though victims with the power to perceive Charms (such as through Essence sight) understand exactly what the warlock is attempting and the attack is not unblockable for them. Even victims who remain unaware of the curse levied against their souls can apply their Dodge MDV as a passive instinct, but do not know they have done so.
         If the attack succeeds, the target can pay three Willpower to reject the unholy influence. Doing so does not grant awareness of the magic she avoided, though she feels inexplicably tired. Fortunately, paying this Willpower also immunizes her against all applications of this Charm for the rest of the scene. Victims who fail to pay Willpower against a successful attack suffer as follows:
         • The victim must avoid the warlock for a full month to break the Charm's magic (defined in subsequent bullets). Any scene of social interaction resets this countdown, whether hostile or cordial.
         • If the victim harbors an existing Intimacy toward the warlock when the Charm takes hold, the Infernal learns that fact and understands the nature of those feelings. Moreover, that Intimacy becomes enchanted as an Emotion effect. If eroded or removed, the Intimacy returns at full strength each day at sunset until the magic ends. Effects that change the emotional context of the Intimacy are permissible and don't get reversed; the redefined Intimacy reasserts itself normally with its new context.
         • If the victim has no Intimacy toward the Infernal at the time of activation, the Infernal realizes this and chooses an emotional context. The victim then gains an Intimacy toward him with the chosen context. The enchanted Intimacy continually reasserts itself as explained in the previous bullet.
         • The victim feels drawn to seek out the Infernal, finding him to be irresistibly fascinating. This Servitude effect doesn't actually compel her in any way. Instead, the forced attention gnaws at her dreams. For every five days that pass without spending a scene socially interacting with the warlock, the victim suffers a cumulative -1 internal penalty on Conviction rolls to regain Willpower from rest. This penalty can reduce the pool to zero dice, forfeiting any gain. A scene of interaction with the warlock resets the penalty to zero (but resets the month countdown).
         A second purchase of this Charm requires Essence 4+, but permits a Performance-based attack as an alternative to the standard Presence-based method described above. Compare the attack roll to the MDV of all listeners, each of whom resist separately as though individually targeted. All new Intimacies formed this way must have the same emotional context. The Storyteller may assume that no one resists unless they are naturally wary and untrusting or harbor personal animosity toward the warlock. Players choose whether to resist or not as normal.

         The Ultimate Darkness knows no greater pleasure than to shatter the mighty, break the hearts of heroes, and bring mortality to those who seemed invincible. Upon learning this Charm, the character gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, the Fiend may only fill it by acting as the architect of another man's ruin.
         In order to use this Charm against a particular target, the warlock must first mark at least one character to whom the target has a positive Intimacy with the effect of Our Little Secret (see Ink Monkeys, vol. 7). The Intimacy must have a strong emotional context, such as love or friendship, and the effect of the warlock's trigger of Our Little Secret must still be intact (the target has not spent Willpower or used Charms to break their silence about the horror they have witnessed).
         The Infernal touches his target and pays five motes to activate this Charm. The target immediately intuits that some great harm has befallen each affected loved one as an Obvious effect. This does not reveal the details of Our Little Secret or the exact nature of the harm that has been done to each victim. At this juncture, the character also understands that he may allow full knowledge of what has transpired to enter his consciousness. By doing so, he explicitly agrees to allow the effects of this Charm through his Shaping defenses (if any). If he chooses not to allow this dread knowledge to reveal itself to him, he must spend one Willpower to resist immediately running from the scene to fly to the aid of his loved ones. Spending Willpower to resist this unnatural Compulsion always grants characters with the Great Curse a point of Limit, even if they have already gained Limit for resisting unnatural mental influence during the scene.
         If the target does allow himself to see The Face in the Darkness, he witnesses each and every depravity the warlock has forced his loved ones to endure in silence. This tragic and horrifying sequence of sounds and images plays through the target's mind instantly, but he experiences it in painstaking detail, standing helplessly and intangibly by as each of his loved ones are victimized. This cruel and deliberate show of atrocity has the following side effects:
         • The target gains an Intimacy of hatred to the Infernal on the spot.
         • If the target had any Overdrive motes, he loses a number of them equal to the number of victims revealed to him. The warlock adds five times this number of offensive motes to his Overdrive pool.
         • The target feels emasculated by the harm done to his loved ones, and is unable to channel his Virtues for the rest of the scene as a Crippling effect.
         • For the rest of the scene, if the target gains offensive motes to his Overdrive pool, any gains are reduced by a single mote, to a minimum of zero. Motes lost enter the warlock's Overdrive pool on the same tick.

      <comment>On The Face In The Darkness: "I'm really proud of this Charm. When I sat down to start writing Infernal Overdrives, I saved the Ebon Dragon for last, thinking he would be the hardest. Or at least, I tried to. During a lull between Charms, I started thinking about his Overdrives. I had a few concepts, but this one hit me while I was considering what parts of his tree to build off of. What I most like about this Charm is how it forces you to play like the Ebon Dragon, orchestrating the downfall of your hated enemy and planning it so that in the very scene where you reveal all the damage you've done to his loved ones, you gain the upper hand. By the way, the name is an allusion to a line from Games of Divinity." -Ø</comment>

         The Ebon Dragon would choose almost any end to conflict over a glorious last stand. Though he loathes putting himself at risk, he knows the price of surrender. This Charm allows a Fiend to modify its prerequisite, paying an extra 10 motes upon activation to set the stage for a terrifying showdown. The Infernal must activate this effect in an enclosed space no larger than (Essence x 10) yards in radius. Enclosed means four walls, a ceiling (or other substantial overhead cover, such as a dome), and a floor. The Storyteller should not be overly precise in interpreting these parameters: the presence of windows, doors, or holes in the structure do not disqualify the use of this Charm. Before the sun's birth, the Ebon Dragon dwelt in cracks and the spaces between things, and he still holds dominion in these places. Characters wishing to bolt themselves into deep cracks or caves may gain this Charm's effects in spite of the gaping entrance which fronts one side of the enclosure. The Storyteller should follow the spirit of this Charm more than the letter.
         Nothing is so dangerous as a dragon in its lair. This is especially true of the Ebon Dragon. The pitch black field within the enclosure has all the same statistics as the prerequisite, with the following additional effects: the darkness within this enclosure cannot be penetrated by natural light. Magical light sources strobe unnaturally, giving a hollow white effusion that produces only half the usual intensity. Shadows thrown by such light are always horrific, menacing intruders in the Dragon's Lair. But enemies of the warlock should be thankful to ever see them.
         For the duration of the effect, the Fiend is aware of the exact position of anyone standing in the pall of Dragon's Lair Obtenebration, and may strike them at any distance, so long as both the warlock and his targets remain within the confines of the shadow. The Fiend may attack such targets as if he were standing right beside them, and may pick any angle for the attack, making cover completely impossible. Additionally, the first time any character emerges into the field of darkness, the Fiend is aware of it and may make an immediate unexpected reflexive attack against that character.
         The Essence 6+ range expansion of Noon as Night Evocation does not apply to Dragon's Lair Obtenebration until Essence 8.

         The Shadow of All Things spreads his darkness so that he might know all things and that all things might know him. The character may use this Charm to supplement any attack made against characters standing within the pall of Noon as Night Evocation. If the attack accrues any post-soak damage, a massive torrent of black Essence wells up around the victim, dragging them into the air no more than ten yards off the ground. Gigantic characters (such as the Ebon Dragon) may raise their captives higher, to just below eye level. If the victim is an Exalt, this utter darkness strangles their anima as it binds them in powerful coils of shadow. This is an automatically successful clinch which will maintain itself using the Infernal's (Wits + Essence), with a number of automatic successes on every renewal of the clinch equal to the post-soak damage of the initial attack. The coils have a base damage of the Infernal's (Essence + Willpower)B, and will attempt to crush an opponent into submission so long as the Infernal maintains this effect. Characters lacking countermagic spells may physically attack shadow coils in order to free their allies. Shadow coils have the same DVs and soak as their creator, and must suffer three or more levels of damage from a single attack to disrupt them.
         The Infernal may not attack a victim caught in his Seizing Coil Atemi without the use of free reflexive attacks. However, he may continue to attack other opponents within the shadows, and may capture (Essence) foes simultaneously using this Charm. Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, the Infernal must keep motes committed to Seizing Coil Atemi for the duration of the effect - typically until the clinch is broken, a relevant countermagic spell is cast, or he chooses to release a victim from his coils. If the pall created by Noon as Night Evocation is dispelled, all coils immediately release their victims as the effect terminates.

      <description>The Ebon Dragon abides his imprisonment with thoughts of becoming his captors� warden. This Charm creates an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, the warlock may fill it any time he uses Seizing Coil Atemi to capture a target that has snared or successfully clinched him in the last week, or a target who has ever imprisoned him in his entire life. For each action the warlock maintains a successful clinch on valid targets with Seizing Coil Atemi, he gains offensive motes: one mote per unenlightened victim, and (victim's Essence / 2, rounded up) motes from all Essence-channeling victims coiled in his shadows. When used by the Ebon Dragon, Wicked Void Reversal considers all non-Infernal, non-Alchemical Exalted as valid targets for this Charm's effect.</description>

         The Shadow of All Things abhors Virtue, but its absence empowers him. While this Charm is active, whenever another character within (Essence x 10) yards of the Infernal spends a Willpower point to ignore the dictates of a Virtue rated 3+, the warlock knows which Virtue has been ignored, how many dots the person ignoring the Virtue has of it, and where exactly the act of deliberate wickedness took place relative to his present location. If the target is the warlock's Nemesis or someone he has a negative Intimacy toward, he absorbs the point of Willpower as it is spent. If the Infernal has Essence 3+, he also gains a brief synopsis of what course of action the character took that the Virtue forbid as if that action were Obvious to his senses. Essence 4+ makes the character's rationale for doing so Obvious, though she can spend another Willpower to shield her reasons (which can't be consumed). Essence 5+ renders the sinner's identity Obvious, though shielding her rationale also shields her identity.
         A repurchase at Essence 4+ pushes the radius to (Essence x 100) yards. A third purchase at Essence 6+ raises this to (Essence) miles. Once the radius reaches this third threshold, the character's awareness of Virtue's failure occurs as a mental aside rather than a constant deluge of information. When it is unimportant to know who has sinned and why from a plot perspective, the Charm internalizes but does not trouble the Infernal with these details. Fully sensing a specific instance of moral degradation to the point that the Storyteller interrupts play with narrative of the event should indicate that the immorality is somehow significant to the warlock's interests or important to the setting.

         The Ebon Dragon's touch brings unimaginable horror upon those foolish enough to oppose him. This Charm can enhance any ranged attack. If the attack hits a living being, the induced agony and paralysis imposes a -2 internal penalty to all rolled, non-reflexive physical actions, -1 to all static values (like DVs) and -2 yards from the distance natural movement can cover each tick for that victim for the rest of the scene. The total penalty from all uses of this Charm cannot reduce a rolled pool below the victim's Essence rating or (half Essence, rounded up) for static values, while Move and Dash actions use their normal limits for minimum speed. Victims of this Charm can lessen this curse's hold on themselves as a diceless Speed 5, DV -1 miscellaneous action costing five motes per activation removed, with no upper limit on expenditure, but this action can't be part of a flurry. Appropriate countermagic clears all activations away.
         Each (Essence 3+) repurchase provides one of the following:
         • The activation cost decreases by one mote and the scope of the penalty expands to impede all non-reflexive actions. Lower-Essence victims automatically drop prone whenever struck by an attack enhanced with this Charm as a Knockback effect.
         • By paying an extra two motes, the warlock can use this Charm in Step 9 as a special Counterattack against an attacker within (Essence x 2) yards. Obvious serpentine emanations from his anima deliver the curse.

         Although the Ebon Dragon loathes his confinement above all else, he also understands the necessity of biding his time. An Infernal may use this Charm whenever a hostile mental influence overcomes his defenses and he may pay Willpower to resist/mitigate the effects (i.e. he has the required points available). By activating this Charm, the character refuses to pay the Willpower cost and accepts the influence's hold over him. However, he regains one Willpower from his voluntarily submission while his attacker loses one Willpower (and gains one Limit if she has a Limit track). The Infernal may even acquiesce to social attacks that violate his Motivation or Urge.
         Victory in Defeat does not provide a constant stream of Willpower for acquiescing to harmless or mildly inconveniencing requests, such as a merchant hawking his wares. Hostility means actual harm to the Infernal or something he values, especially influence that makes him act against his own interests.

         The Infernal parrots the words of a foe, perhaps speaking a half second behind like an echo or modulating his voice with exaggerated distortions or even repeating key phrases as part of a grander insulting oration. While his manner of rebuke may seem childish, it is actually a form of anti-speech, a vocalized principle of incoherence and insanity that drains the opponent's words of all persuasive power. Mocking Murmurs Retort can defend against any form of mental or social influence as a perfect parry so long as that influence is not unexpected, even stopping unblockable attacks and those operating outside the timeframe of social combat. The cost to use Mocking Murmurs Retort later in the scene against further mental influence from the same attacker decreases by one mote, to a minimum of one mote once the Infernal has used this Charm five or more times against that opponent. The Infernal does have to audibly vocalize anti-speech (even against a written attack), but may incoherently mumble under his breath if he doesn't want to make it obvious what he is doing. This Charm is vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Shadow of All Thing.
         Whenever an Essence 5+ Infernal uses Mocking Murmurs Retort to defend against a non-targeted social attack (like most Performance-based attacks), he may pay an extra four motes and add the Obvious keyword to his response. If he does, the Charm perfectly parries the attack for all listeners who observe his response, but he cannot hide his response in whispers.

      <description>The Ebon Dragon cannot channel Virtues, but he gains a second pool of Willpower points equal to his Essence rating that he can choose to refill when regaining points as normal. Points from this pool may be spent to power Ebon Dragon Charms (but not activate Combos), to resist unnatural mental influence or to ignore all negative effects of a failed Virtue roll required by an external effect (one Willpower point per roll). If an Infernal learns this Charm, his Virtues drop to 1 and can't be raised again. Lost Virtue dots convert into experience. Until a character has Essence 10, his primary Virtue remains 3 for the sole purpose of Limit gain.</description>

      <description>The Ebon Dragon conjures unnatural darkness centered anywhere up to (Willpower x 10) yards away and spreading in any desired shape that fits in a radius of (Essence x 10) yards. This blackness is opaque to those outside and blinds all within who lack magic to see in darkness. Sunlight created by something with an Essence, artifact or hearthstone rating higher than the shadow's creator's Essence dispels it; normal sunlight does not. A character with Essence 4+ who knows Life-Denying Hate, Ever-Hungry Shadow Affliction or Despair-Choked Spirit Maiming may add any of these Charms' costs to the cost of Noon As Night Evocation, cursing everyone besides the shadow's creator who isn't protected from Shaping attacks to suffer as though being tagged by the Charm(s) in question while remaining in the darkness. Essence 6+ extends the maximum range and radius to one mile and three miles, respectively.</description>

It also makes it Stackable so that it can simultaneously target as many different enemies as the Ebon Dragon commits motes to effect. Multiple opponents may be simultaneously copied with the same activation, paying one mote per enemy. Only one antithetical Motivation is conferred by the Charm at once, but the Ultimate Darkness may reflexively switch between options once per action tick. Ending the Charm Black Mirror Shintai restores all adversarial commitments made with all activations of Nemesis Self Imagined Anew the character had upon activating the shintai.</description>

The lie must be directly harmful for the listener to believe it, such as convincing a heroine that her lover is dead (when she is alive and well) or that the Ebon Dragon is her friend. All targets with an MDV less than the successes rolled develop an Intimacy toward the lie and cannot recognize the unnatural mental influence for what it is or weaken the Intimacy without spending two Willpower points per scene. Excising the Intimacy ends the deception and instills a new Intimacy of hate toward the deceiver.</description>

      <description>Upon activating Black Mirror Shintai to target someone he can perceive within one mile, the Ebon Dragon may pay 20 motes and one Willpower instead. Doing so does not pull the victim's shadow into himself. Instead, the stolen shadow coalesces within 10 yards of the Ebon Dragon into a copy of the target, possessing the traits the Ultimate Darkness would gain using the shintai. The copy comes into existence with the same health and Willpower points remaining as the original had at the time of duplication, but it has no motes of its own and spends its creator's motes (as long as he permits the drain). The copy is as obedient to its creator as a bound demon is. This Charm can spawn only one entity at a time unless the character has Essence 9+, in which case as many different characters may be concurrently duplicated with a single activation as the Ebon Dragon wishes to sustain with committed Essence. The character cannot copy himself or copy the same character with separate activations of the Charm.</description>

      <description>Upon activating the Charm's prerequisite, the Ebon Dragon's body expands into his distinctive draconic form, stretching up to 50 miles from snout to tail and two miles wide. This epic size does not make him easier to hit, as attacks he dodges pass harmlessly through him. His own attacks cannot be part of a flurry, but simultaneously hit everything within a radius of half his width around the desired impact point with a single attack roll, against which each target in that radius separately defends. His blast attack also has a range increment of three miles. Charms enhancing his attacks apply equally to all victims as though they were the sole target. Infernals who learn this Charm may swell into a dark titanic version of their iconic anima instead of assuming dragon shape, subject to the same size limits.</description>

         Kimbery moves upon and through herself freely, for her nature is its own dominion. Upon learning this Charm, the character gains the following:
         • She adds (Essence) bonus successes to all Attribute and/or Ability rolls to harvest food from liquid or move effectively and safely via a liquid medium. Attacks never benefit, not even to remove obstacles. Examples of valid actions include: fishing, gathering kelp, swimming, resisting fatigue from swimming, holding one's breath while submerged, balancing on a ship's deck in turbulent seas, piloting aquatic vehicles and riding aquatic mounts.
         • As an aquatic being, she ignores the -2 penalty terrestrial beings suffer to move while submerged. Her actions move through liquid like air, allowing her to do seemingly impossible feats like swing sledges and fire bows underwater.
         • She may multiply her swimming speed by her Essence rating. Obvious currents of ichor drag her forward and trail behind (Essence x 100) yards while using this power, adding one success to track her for a half hour. She can accelerate other means of personally moving via liquid (such as walking on it).
         • With Essence 3+, neither she nor any aquatic mount she rides suffers fatigue from actions this Charm assists.

         It is not the cold of Kimbery's depths that her enemies fear, but the colorful stains upon her surface. Slow death is the way of The Sea That Marched Against the Flame. Activating this Charm requires the Infernal to touch a beloved object, anointing it with spidery glyphs and patterns in garish hues (Essence 3+ warlocks can paint these designs with their gaze alone). Multiple activations can stack additional markings onto the same object. Whenever the enchanted object is used as a weapon to hit a non-beloved character or such a target touches it with bare flesh, all imbued stains spray into the point of contact as doses of poison like the surface of Kimbery. The Infernal can also paint herself to strike a poisonous blow.
         Repurchase at Essence 3+ allows activation as a Sorcerous effect with duration one month and makes the poison akin to Kimbery's depths (upgrades in parentheses). An object so marked discharges a dose of venom whenever the circumstances previously described occur, though direct contact only inflicts one dose per action. With Essence 5+, even beloved structures may be enchanted.
         Poison Lacquer: Damage: 5L (7L)/action, Toxicity: 3(4), Tolerance: None, Penalty: -3(-4)

         The blood of Kimbery is sacred. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm suffers one or more levels of non-bashing damage (including converting bashing to lethal), her wounds create a bubbling high-pressure splatter of poison. The spray hits everything within two yards of the Infernal as a single attack with a dice pool of (Stamina + Resistance + [levels of damage that triggered it]); each victim defends separately. Those hit suffer one dose of poison with the statistics of Spiteful Sea Tincture.Additionally, the Infernal's toxic blood kills illnesses, granting immunity to non-magical Sickness effects. Primordials and akuma are similarly immune to magical Sickness while other users only add (Essence) bonus dice to resist them.
         A repurchase extends the splatter to (Essence) yards. Further, the character's blood becomes highly caustic. Characters hit by the spray suffer the usual poison and a one-time environmental hazard with (Essence)L Damage and Trauma (maximum Trauma 5). If a non-magical, non-natural close combat weapon unleashed the spray, halve its accuracy, damage and defense (rounded down) until repaired. A second exposure destroys it completely.

         Kimbery is all poisons, but not all poisons are alike to her. Some formulations are so pleasing to her aesthetics that she has made them part of herself. Each time this Charm is purchased, the Infernal gains one of the following:
         • Once all her -0 and -1 health levels are filled with damage, she becomes immune to damage from Poison effects. The total penalty from all Poison effects afflicting her can't rise above (5 - Essence).
         • Whenever she would create a lethal or aggravated poison with a Kimbery Charm, she can choose to have it inflict bashing damage. This doubles the total damage for the dose and ensures that none of the damage it causes can spill past Incapacitated to convert into lethal. The worst it can do is render victims unconscious - the better to torture them later. Furthermore, she can forgo the penalties for her Kimbery poisons to make subtle toxins victims can't feel ravaging them (though their players still know).
         • Whenever the Infernal would create a damaging poison with a Kimbery Charm, she may instead create a soul-twisting toxin. Each time the poison would inflict a level of damage, the victim can pay one Willpower point to resist the unnatural Emotion effect. If he doesn't, his player chooses one of his positive Intimacies and converts it to a negative Intimacy with an emotional context of his choosing.
         • Whenever the Infernal would create a damaging poison with a Kimbery Charm, she may instead create a mutagenic Desecration toxin. Her player selects a mutation emulating aquatic biology. Each time the mutagenic poison would inflict a level of damage, it accumulates a mutation point. Once it accumulates mutation points equal to the selected mutation's cost (positive or negative), the victim gains that trait. If the Infernal afflicts a victim with multiple doses, she must also choose the order that the different mutations appear.

         When enraged, Kimbery lashes enemies with her infinite arms. Upon activation, the character chooses at least one cupful of any inanimate liquid she can perceive within (Essence x 100) yards. The usual gore of a battlefield is generally more than sufficient. The liquid darkens and hisses as it gains a semblance of life, swelling and coagulating to form (Essence rating) gelatinous, green-black tentacles up to (Essence x 3) yards long. These emerge from the spot (or spots) where they were created. The warlock can reflexively retract these tentacles back through their individual anchor points and extrude them from other liquids within range, meaning nowhere within range is safe.
         Mentally wielded as separate close combat weapons with (Wits + Occult), the tentacles ignore cover penalties from anything less than total cover and inflict bashing by default. The Infernal can make their attacks lethal by willing them to grow suckers, barbs, mouths or acid tear-weeping eyes. She must flurry normally to wield multiple tentacles simultaneously. Attacks against the lashing tentacles are futile; their writhing undulations dodge even undodgeable attacks. They don't dodge or parry while clinching a victim; if struck during this time, they have 10L soak and are immune to bashing damage, requiring ten levels of damage to destroy. If all tentacles are destroyed, the Charm deactivates. Reactivating Ichor Flux Tendrils while active regenerates all destroyed tendrils. When the Charm ends for any reason, remaining tentacles evaporate into tarry fumes.
         An Essence 3+ repurchase allows the tentacles to make clinches without additional effort on their creator's part, wielding themselves with accuracy and bashing damage 10. The warlock reflexively selects a target and decides whether to hold or crush. After that, the tentacle does the rest, seeking to repeat the action on that target until given new directions or personally wielded by the Infernal. The Infernal can only take direct control or indicate new targets on her action tick. She can always command an autonomous tentacle to reflexively release a victim and resume its usual mad writhing. Only two autonomous tentacles can clinch the same target.
         Tentacle Lash: Speed 6, Accuracy +3, Damage (Willpower + Essence)B, Defense +2, Rate 1, Tags: D, R
         Tentacle Clinch: Speed 6, Accuracy +3, Damage (Willpower + Essence)B, Rate 1, Tags: C, P, R

         Kimbery's vanity does not allow her to waste time sleeping that she could spend contemplating her own virtue. Lost in dreams, she might miss a prayer of gratitude for her benevolence. This Charm provides the following:
         • Each full hour submerged counts as rest for Essence respiration, regardless of exertion. Surfacing for a quick breath doesn't disrupt submergence, though surfacing for any other reason does.
         • Spending an hour praying to herself or Kimbery while submerged in a sea and making a successful prayer roll lets her respire 20 motes.
         • Spending (8 - Essence, minimum 1) hours meditating while submerged provides all benefits of sleeping eight hours.
         • She can speak Old Realm while submerged and her words carry as well as through air. Her dialect is that of the ancient Lintha, the holy inflection Kimbery seared into the principle of liquid during Creation's genesis.
         • She can verbally pray to any being who knows First Kimbery Excellency with a prayer at -1 target number as a Shaping effect, provided the target and her are both submerged in a sea at the time of the prayer. Secret currents between all seas carry the words to the target's mind even if she can't normally hear prayers.

         Kimbery alone devours Kimbery, for none else is worthy. This Charm may be activated in one of three ways:
         • By paying five motes in step 2, the Infernal can reject any unwanted Shaping effect. This causes her to gain a mutation of her player's choice as a permanent Desecration (emulating the biology of aquatic life). With Essence 4+, she can also block Crippling effects by gaining a mutation, paying only three motes if the mutation connects to the averted injury (like a severed hand staying attached via sinewy tentacle). This use is an innate power rather than Charm activation.
         • By paying three Willpower while submerged in a sea, the Infernal can dissolve any mutation she possesses, provided it is not a prerequisite for other traits she possesses. Until Essence 4+, she can only dissolve mutations she gave herself.
         • With Essence 3+, the warlock can pay three Willpower to enhance a physical attack that hit a living target with mutations in step 10. The attack inflicts an extra level of lethal damage as it painfully dissolves a mutation of the Infernal's choice.

         Gaia conceived the element of water, but Kimbery hoarded it in one place to fill the yawning abyss of the West with glorious depths. Accordingly, all things that live in the sea should rightly call her Great Mother.
         To use this Charm, the Infernal touches a sea in Creation or the Wyld and entreats the depths in Old Realm, necessitating she know the language and make a successful prayer roll (target number -1 if submerged). Her words spread as an invisible ripple through the cosmos, entreating a monster to rise and serve the will of Kimbery through her. The summoned beast finds and enters a secret current between seas, arriving (10 - Essence) minutes later. While the Charm remains active, the monster is enchanted as follows:
         • It must obey the Infernal like a bound demon without regard for its own safety. This Servitude can't be broken by spending Willpower.
         • It understands all commands the Infernal speaks to it in Old Realm and can execute those commands as though it had minimum Intelligence 2.
         • The Infernal can command it at a distance via successful prayers as though the beast knew First Kimbery Excellency.
         Any natural animal that lives in the sea of the Wyld or Creation is a valid target of this Charm; separate activations can bind multiple creatures. With Essence 3+, the Infernal may also summon natural animals warped by Desecration-based mutations. The player selects desired mutations that can't encompass more positive mutation points than (the Infernal's [Willpower + Essence]) + (the creature's total number of negative mutation points). The creature is not changed by summoning; rather, it is a victim of the pollution Kimbery and the ruin of the Lintha Empire left in Creation after the Primordial War.
         With repurchase at Essence 3+, the warlock can entreat the seas of Creation or the Wyld at night (or the seas of the Demon Realm at any time), summoning an unbound member of any predominantly aquatic First Circle demon race (but not a specific demon) from a sea in any realm of existence. The Charm enslaves these demons normally, but is preempted by spells that summon or bind enchanted demons.
         A third purchase at Essence 5+ allows the summoning of any specific aquatic Primordial behemoth smaller than a geographic entity (i.e. no Lintha Ng Oroo). This follows the timing and location restrictions for First Circle demon summoning. The Charm only brings the behemoth to the warlock and doesn't grant control unless the warlock's Essence is greater than its. If other creatures smaller than the behemoth are in physical contact with it when it answers the summons, they are carried along. Behemoths are unique and powerful; most are massive, nigh-immortal entities capable of challenging Celestial Exalted.

         The Sea That Marched Against the Flame drowns all things but herself. The Infernal can target herself, any beloved object, beloved character, or, with Essence 3+, beloved structure. Separate activations can protect multiple targets concurrently. While the Charm is active, the target becomes immune to physical harm resulting from immersion or exposure to all liquids. All liquid is as the purest air to breathe and purest water to drink. This shields living beneficiaries from drowning and allows them to swim in lava, acid or high-pressure ocean trenches without harm. The protection also extends to owned possessions worn or carried on a protected being, provided they aren't notably larger than the Infernal.
         The Great Mother's self-immunity also renders beneficiaries immune to harm from non-magical Poison effects. However, the first time each scene in which a target would have suffered harm from poison without this Charm, the warlock internalizes the toxin within her soul. This counts as a scene spent developing a negative Intimacy toward an individual or group of people who have given some offense to the warlock in the past week (however trivial). Intoxication isn't harm except to the degree it causes penalties, so the Infernal experiences full euphoria from intoxicants without drawback.
         Repurchase at Essence 3+ improves the poison resistance to encompass magical toxins. If the Infernal targets herself, the protection simultaneously shields all beloved characters within (Essence x 100) yards.

         It amuses Kimbery when her children build boats to keep her out, as it amuses mothers when their children hide behind pillow fortresses. In her infinite love, The Sea That Marched Against the Flame plays along with such games. To use this Charm, the Infernal touches a beloved aquatic mount, a beloved aquatic vehicle or any beloved object long and flat enough to surf upon as an alternative to swimming (like a daiklave). Her power flows through the target, oozing into the hungry sea beyond and demanding obeisance. Even absent other propulsion, the enchanted conveyance can propel itself along a current of ichor at twice the warlock's swimming speed (as improved by Mother Sea Mastery). Alternately, this current can quicken sailing or other means of propulsion, doubling the target's usual speed. The Charm ends prematurely if the warlock travels more than (Essence x 100) yards from the beneficiary.
         With Essence 3+, the Charm's duration extends to Indefinite. With Essence 5+, the cost drops to a single mote. Repurchase at Essence 3+ allows the Charm to bless beloved characters other than mounts and enables alternate activation as a spherical blessing upon all beloved characters within (Essence x 100) yards while active.

         Kimbery is The Sea That Marched Against the Flame. But did she win? Each purchase of this Charm provides one of the revelations listed below, a truth seared into the Great Mother by her first nemesis. The options list forbidden and mandatory actions. The warlock ignores all mental influence as an unacceptable order if it seeks to make her perform a forbidden action or refrain from mandatory action. Unfortunately, the Infernal can't voluntarily take forbidden actions or fail to act as directed unless she pays Willpower equal to her Essence (maximum 5) to hypocritically override the Charm's unnatural Compulsion for a day. Even if this cost is paid, the Charm's defense against external influence remains. When different Compulsions clash, the Storyteller chooses which has preeminence. Each revelation also confers a unique power.
         • Mother Before Daughter: The Infernal can't knowingly betray beloved characters or ancestors from whom she descends (i.e. parents, grandparents, etc.). Betrayal means a course of action or inaction that she believes will result in more harm than good. When making rolls to navigate anywhere or track a beloved character, she adds bonus successes equal to the number of beloved characters she has.
         • Trust Is Naïve: The Infernal refuses to believe anything bad about a beloved character. At best, she can be persuaded that such a character is a victim who has been duped into poor decisions by the wickedness of others. She requires only a single scene of action or persuasion to build a positive Intimacy toward anyone she has never reviled.
         • Existence Is Agony: The Infernal can't show mercy. She may spare an enemy, but only with the intent to prolong his suffering. If multiple courses of action seem to offer roughly equivalent benefit to herself, she must choose the path she believes will maximize harm to non-beloved characters along the way. Compassion 3+ no longer compels her to care about anyone except beloved characters, though she may magnanimously choose to care about strangers in hopes of making them beloved.
         • Never Forgive: The Infernal cannot abandon or weaken a negative Intimacy toward reviled characters and refuses to believe anything good about them. When she makes a social attack encouraging others to think ill of a reviled character (Emotion and/or Illusion) or harm a reviled character (Compulsion), her words become unnatural mental influence.
         • Hate Springs Eternal: The Infernal can't knowingly help a reviled character unless she believes her own life depends on it. Her great heart can still sustain (Willpower + Compassion) positive Intimacies without risk of losing them through sleep, but negative Intimacies do not count against this limit and never fall off that way. Additionally, she adds +1 to her DV and MDV against the attacks of reviled characters; manifest loathing shields her even against enemies too foolish to fear her.

         Kimbery's kindness never goes unpunished. Such is the cruelty of a mad and broken universe. This Charm may be used in one of two ways:
         • It can serve as a step 2 defense against any unexpected physical or social attack for one mote, causing the attack to become expected unless the attacker is a beloved character. With Essence 4+, this use has a duration of one action, defending against all valid surprise attacks during that time.
         • It can enhance a Join Battle roll for a cost of three motes, adding a number of bonus successes equal to the Infernal's Essence rating. With Essence 3+ and 4+ (respectively), the Charm can similarly aid Join War and Join Debate actions.
         With Essence 3+, Infernals may use All Things Betray as an innate power rather than Charm activation by paying a one Willpower surcharge. However, this versatility comes at a price; the warlock becomes so accustomed to the certainty of betrayal that she must pay one Willpower for a scene of voluntary effort to count toward building a positive Intimacy toward another being (other sorts of Intimacies aren't affected).

         <description>Ignore the innate power ability. Instead, at Essence 3+, the Infernal can use this Charm to defend against unexpected attacks made by beloved characters. Doing so causes her to gain a point of Limit and an Intimacy of hatred towards her attacker, which overwrites any prior Intimacies to them.</description>

      <description>Men are as impotent as minnows to flee a tidal wave. This Charm is a magical flurry of (Essence rating) valid actions with a Speed and DV penalty equal to the greatest values among component actions. Valid actions must carry the certainty of deliberately harming exactly one target, such as physical or social attacks. Further, all actions in the flurry must have different targets unless they all target a reviled character.</description>

         Hate shelters The Sea That Marched Against the Flame from the wretched and vile universe that wants to hurt her. Used as a step 2 defense, this Charm adds a bonus of (total number of negative Intimacies) to the warlock's dodge DV or dodge MDV against a single attack. The bonus may explicitly break the usual cap on DV bonuses from Charms. Alternately, Bitter Heart Unbleeding may be used as a step 7 defense, adding the same bonus to the Infernal's soak against a single instance of damage. To onlookers, it appears that the injuries luckily missed vital areas or that the warlock evaded at the last moment to suffer only grazing wounds.
         An Essence 3+ repurchase grants additional powers. First, the soak boost mode adds equivalent natural Hardness while in proximity to a sea. Second, the Infernal can pay an extra mote to dissolve the injurious power of an attack outright (reducing raw and final damage to zero). Denying damage this way carries the Imperfection of The Sea That Marched Against the Flame, causing tongues of hissing green fog to rise from the wounds that never were.

         Kimbery's least shintai evokes the most ancient life that swam within her. In activating this Charm, the Infernal's acidic blood disintegrates her flesh completely and consumes her Essence, liquefying the totality of her being. The transubstantiation into green-black ichor doubles the overall volume of her body and provides the following powers:
         • All worn and carried possessions are banished Elsewhere for the duration.
         • Her amorphous form can flow through any crack that isn't airtight and her identity is unrecognizable. Also, physical force can't really hurt her; she can't suffer more than a single level of damage per attack or other instance in step 10. Fire, lightning and directed Essence attacks (like implosion bow fire) harm her normally, as do weapons dipped in oil and lit aflame.
         • She gains all benefits of using Fathomless Poison Haven.
         • Her inchoate body grows tentacles identical to those created with Ichor Flux Tendrils (similarly capable of independent clinches). Severing these tentacles doesn't harm her. She regenerates all severed appendages each action tick.
         • Eyes of endless variety blink and glare across her body, letting her use All Things Betray as an innate power for free.
         • Contact with her body is an environmental hazard with the same statistics as her acid blood. Victims struck by her suffer one-time exposure, while those clinched steadily dissolve.
         • On each action tick, she can give herself one permanent mutation as a Desecration effect. All of these mutations dissolve when the Charm ends.
         • She flows through or over other liquids at her swim-ming speed. She flows over solid surfaces at her ground move speed without regard for gravity (such as by oozing up walls).

         In the time before Creation, the Great Mother was ancient beyond reckoning, with a vastness surpassed only by the Endless Desert, and fathoms deep such as she could swallow the unborn universe. All facets of Kimbery exalt Kimbery; all fathoms of her limitless depths exist to magnify and exude Kimbery and sing of her greatness. So it is with lesser waters to deify to the greatest of all oceans.
         When the Infernal learns this Charm, she gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of twenty motes. Initially empty, it may be filled by the empowering hosannas of Primordial waters. This Charm may only be activated if surrounded by surface water on all sides for at least 100 yards. Doing so immediately calms the waters within (Essence x 500) yards. If a storm is raging in the area, it erodes gradually over the next ten ticks, until there is nothing but calm and eerie silence over the waters. In the midst of open sea, all waves vanish. A sufficiently large river will cease flowing. Currents lose their pull, and winds churn and whorl in loose vortices, making sails useless. Mundane vessels caught on such waters may only be moved manually (by use of oars) or by magical locomotion. But these doldrums are anything but lifeless.
         The area of the effect then develops huge pulses of inner glow, as sickly yellow-green phosphorescent lights 30 yards wide rise to the surface like pustules on diseased skin. They churn, exude vapors, and strobe open and shut like great watching eyes, while the enormous shadows of alien nightmares rise up to swim just below the surface, turning calm waters into an ominous froth. Never cresting, these beasts can be seen only as shadows illuminated by eldritch glow - a manifestation of countless ancient horrors long since forgotten. Deep mournful lowing rises up from the depths. Soon it is followed by hundreds of intangible motonic fireflies which drift into the sky and can be seen for miles. Then the song begins, emanating from the collective voice of all aquatic existence: waves, wind, waters, and all the things living in them sing the song of Kimbery. This chant is in no known language, but listeners understand the words as a matter of instinct: Kimbery's greatness is unending, her power terrifying, her reach limitless, her love / hate (they are the same) boundless and inescapable.
         Song of the Depths confers the following additional benefits:
         • The warlock gains (Essence) offensive motes.
         • As long as she remains in the area of the effect, she gains two offensive motes per action.
         • Any beloved characters within the area of effect gain a single offensive mote per action, provided they have Overdrive pools.
         • The character may invoke What Lurks Beneath as an innate power, for a cost of 10 motes, if she knows that Charm.
         • Any offensive Charm the warlock uses against a reviled character is reduced in price by one mote, to a minimum of one mote, provided she pays the Charm's activation cost entirely from her Overdrive pool.
         • Characters within the Charm's range attacking subjects of the Infernal's hatred gain the above benefit.
         This effect may only be dispelled by casting Adamant Countermagic at the absolute center of the effect, or by succeeding with a Holy-enhanced Charisma + Presence attack against the effect itself, which has a dodge MDV equal to the warlock's. Lastly, Song of the Depths may be invoked as an innate power while the Infernal is using any Kimbery shintai, for a cost of 10 motes.

      <comment>On Song Of The Depths: "I showed this Charm to one of my playtesters. 'What does this smell like?' she wanted to know. She wondered if it might smell like brine and dead things all risen from the bottom of the sea. Not quite right for Kimbery. So I described it as an overwhelming fragrance that rises briefly in the moment before the lowing starts. Each individual who experiences it imagines it to be the perfume of their own mother, overlying an acrid aroma that lingers beneath. The more you know." -Ø</comment>

         Kimbery is a legendary force of acrimony which all the hordes of chaos could not rend asunder. Rather, she drowned their Shapeless worlds in her darkest fathoms, and excelled toward greater survival, justified by the hatred that empowers her. An Infernal who learns this Charm gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of fifteen motes. Initially empty, it may be filled by paying five motes and activating The Tide Turns. All of the character's positive Intimacies which are not related directly to herself or something she owns immediately turn negative, as the warlock channels every slight or irritation she has ever experienced, real or imagined, in conjunction with the turned Intimacies. This empowering bitterness sustains her, granting her a number of regular and offensive motes equal to the number of positive Intimacies tainted by her spite.
         Positive Intimacies lost in this way do not stay so forever. The mercy of the Great Mother is such that the tide declines, giving pardon to swamped shores and flooded vistas. After a week has passed, the Infernal's positive Intimacies are automatically restored, losing their negative context and returning to positive status regardless of whether the character committed any scenes to their reconstruction. However, one of these Intimacies is always lost to the warlock's turgid enmity and subsequently forgotten. The tide always takes its toll. Should the player seek to recover it, this Intimacy will always return to the character with a negative context. The Storyteller decides which Intimacy is excised at the end of the week.
         The Infernal may not use this Charm more than once a week, unless she takes the time to manually reconstruct her positive Intimacies before the week's end. Any new positive Intimacies built during this time supplant the former positive Intimacies; they remain negative at the end of the week. The warlock is still limited to (Willpower + Compassion) positive Intimacies.

      <comment>On The Tide Turns: "Kimbery has long been my favorite Yozi. Having the chance to imagine her on a more personal scale, and actually contribute to her Charm tree has been a great personal pleasure. As you can see, she makes the most of her social connections, drawing special power from what she loves and hates. I especially love the way this Charm simulates tidal waves crashing on the coast, flood lands rising and withdrawing over time. Turning on those she loves is a matter of course for the Great Mother, just as waves crash incessantly upon the shore." -Ø</comment>

         The Sea That Marched Against the Flame is catalyzed by animosity. Fixating on the grudge that drives her existence, Kimbery's power does not abate. While concentrating on a single reviled character, the warlock may commit one mote to prevent the offensive motes in her Overdrive pool from being lost at the end of the scene. She may retain a commitment to this effect indefinitely. However, doing so prevents her from gaining new offensive motes from any Overdrive Charm unless she has rolled Join Battle against the subject of her grudge. Kimbery is disciplined in the pursuit of her favorite feud. Offensive Charms paid through Overdrive, when used against any other character but the target of her grudge, cost an additional one mote to activate while this Charm is active.
         The character may terminate the effect of Unerring Grief Discipline at any time, but doing so causes her Overdrive pool to void itself of all offensive motes currently in stock.

      <description>Kimbery has long been known to her fellows as the most bitter and spiteful of their kind, inviting her brethren into her drowning waters for the slightest irritation. But after countless millennia, the Yozis have come to appreciate her talent for vicious slurs. An Exalt with this Charm may use her Overdrive pool to fuel social attacks against reviled characters, without a Combo or Charm activation if entirely paid for by Overdrive motes. Note that doing so on the mass social combat scale is only practical if the Infernal hates everyone present - which is distinctly possible for the adepts of Kimbery.</description>
      <comment>On Spite Honing Curses: "And you thought we were relentless teases before... The canny among you may notice that Spite Honing Curses takes Overdrive in a new direction. You may see more of this in the future - we've been tossing around an idea that would let Lunars burn Overdrive motes to fuel their shapeshifting, for example." -H</comment>

      <description>Pain puts life in perspective, pushing aside all other dis-tractions. This is the simplest truth Malfeas has learned from his imprisonment within himself. Use of this Charm allows an Infernal to ignore all negative effects associated with bashing damage she has suffered. Such injuries do not cause wound penalties or slow her down in any way. If reduced to Incapacitated by bashing wounds, she does not fall unconscious, but remains fully aware as further bashing trauma converts to lethal. Aggravated and lethal injuries penalize characters protected by this Charm normally. When this Charm ends, all suspended penalties resume immediately.</description>

      <description>The Demon City is his own architect and does not abide the designs of other artists marring the blueprints of his will. Whenever the Infernal would be altered by a Shaping effect that qualifies as an attack (see Exalted, p. 179), that effect becomes Obvious to his senses so he can make an informed decision before permitting or rejecting the change. Resistance perfectly negates the changes at the cost of gaining one point of Limit from the strain of asserting inviolability. Infernals with Essence 3+ may also use this Charm to stop Shaping effects from altering any owned inanimate object within three yards, though each change to each separate object requires another point of Limit to stop.</description>

      <description>when compared with the corrosive, cosmic power of Malfeas, most diseases bore Infernal Exalted. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal becomes infected with a variant of Final Viridescence (see the "Green Sun Wasting" sidebar, p. 110) that resists all treatment, magical or otherwise. The character automatically fails all checks to mitigate or end the malady's effects. However, once the disease fully runs its course and "kills" the Infernal, his fever breaks, and his disfigured flesh sloughs off to reveal pristine healthy tissue underneath. Not only does the character make a full and immediate recovery, he also becomes immune to all Sickness effects for one season. The breaking of a character's fever does not heal any actual injuries or aid the character apart from reversing the effects of his illness and granting lasting immunity.</description>

         Malfeas does not quietly accept his tortured inversion, but builds up calloused layers and folds them in a vain attempt to seal his wounds and inoculate against future injury. Such efforts cannot achieve their goal, but incidentally toughen the Demon City further. The first purchase of this Charm raises the character's natural lethal soak to her Stamina rating (rather than half) and gives her bashing Hardness equal to her Stamina.
         The second purchase of Scar-Writ Saga Shield requires Essence 3+ and adds the character's Essence rating to her natural bashing and lethal soak. Her Hardness remains unaffected.An Infernal needs Essence 4+ to buy this Charm a third time, at which point her natural bashing and lethal Hardness increase to match her natural soak. Additionally, attackers with a permanent Essence at least four dots less than the Infernal can no longer inflict minimum damage to her with their attacks if they fail to penetrate her soak.

         A fine patina of blue-green tarnish rapidly spreads like mold over the character's body, flaking away to reveal a more durable layer of shining brass etched with maddening spiral patterns and Old Realm characters that tell the stories of Malfeas and foretell the punishments he would inflict upon his enemies. Players of observers literate in Old Realm receive a three-die bonus on all Occult rolls to know such facts while they can see the Infernal. These characters glow pale green, impairing their bearer's stealth as per a four- to seven-mote anima banner display.
         Viridian Legend Exoskeleton is not studied for its luminous history lessons, however. The exoskeleton of living brass provides powerful armor with the following statistics: Soak +10L/+10B, with no mobility or fatigue penalty. This organic alloy has Hardness equal to its soak against attacks made without help of a Charm or artifact weapon. By default, this Charm is incompatible with other armor.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may purchase this Charm a second time, allowing the exoskeleton to grow around and reinforce existing armor. This hybrid armor can't be removed while the Charm is active and has the combined soak of the two armors, the best Hardness values between the armors, no fatigue or movement penalties and all other powers either armor possessed (such as Hardness equaling soak against non-magical attacks). This purchase also increases the Charm's duration to Indefinite.

         Having been humbled once, Malfeas is not keen to repeat the experience. This Charm enhances any attempt to parry an incoming attack, allowing the Infernal to ignore all penalties that apply to her Parry DV (regardless of which Ability or weapon she uses to block). If the Exalt has By Pain Reforged active, she also adds the greatest wound penalty she should suffer as a bonus to her Parry DV and can block lethal or ranged attacks with an unarmed parry.
         Infernals may purchase this Charm a second time, in which case, each use of Pathetic Distraction Rebuke cumulatively reduces the cost to do so again by one mote until the Exalt's next action. For example, the cost to defend against a flurry with four attacks would be six motes (3m + 2m + 1m + 0m).

         The foolish and the mad sometimes beat their fists against the impregnable walls of the Demon City as though they might crack anything but their own hands. The meaningless rhythms of their blows soothe the Yozi's raging heart to laughter. Invulnerable Wounding Futility momentarily hardens the Infernal's body into a passive weapon upon which attackers crash and break.
         This attack destroys nonmagical projectiles but is far more effective against close-combat attacks, where the rebounding force of the blow can actually inflict injuries. The attacker suffers raw bashing damage equal to (the Infernal's soak against the incoming attack - the raw damage of the incoming attack). This value can't be lower than the Infernal's Essence rating or the raw damage of the original attack, whichever is less. This counterattack may be soaked normally but is considered an undodgeable and unblockable attack for the purposes of valid defenses.
         Invulnerable Wounding Futility only retaliates against attacks and does not lessen their damage, and it can't respond to an attack the Infernal completely dodged. Completely parried attacks determine their raw damage for the purposes of this Charm using the weapon's base damage without any attack successes.

      <description>In his torment, Malfeas sheds constant layers in a vain effort to expand past his oaths. The wholesale destruction of a single layer and its inhabitants to push out unwanted injury is as inconsequential as the natural shedding of dead skin. By use of this Charm, an Infernal confidently steps into the path of an attack and chooses for it to hit him full on. The deliberateness of his interposed self perfectly parries the attack regardless of whether it is normally blockable. This Charm can also defend against any environmental hazards (including falling), though it must be activated at each interval at which the hazard inflicts damage. This Charm is a form of parry, not a soak, so the attack doesn't count as having hit when it uselessly impacts the Infernal's body with a spray of sparks and brass shavings. This Charm suffers the Imperfection of the Demon City (see sidebar).</description>

      <description>The Infernal exists at the cusp between sleeping and waking, unable to shake the nagging suspicion that everything she experiences is merely a dream. She truly slumbers only to commune with her subconscious and then only to refresh her psyche in contemplation of terrible things. This Charm permanently improves the character so that she ignores all penalties from sleep deprivation and can always stay awake without a roll. However, when she does choose to sleep, she suffers an internal penalty of -1 on all rolls to regain Willpower upon awakening from the disturbing content of her dreams.</description>

         This Charm permanently improves By Pain Reforged, allowing that Charm to ignore deleterious effects from lethal damage. In addition, if lethal damage would reduce the Infernal below Incapacitated while he is using By Pain Reforged, the damage does not continue into his Dying levels, instead upgrading existing lethal wounds into aggravated damage. Once the Infernal has aggravated wounds in all health levels, further damage can mortally wound or kill him normally.
         When purchased, By Agony Empowered does not mitigate penalties imposed by aggravated damage. Infernals with Essence 5+ may ignore even these penalties, fighting to the last breath without any sign of slowing or acknowledging their wounds.

         It is inconceivable that another could hold authority over Malfeas, no matter what oaths spilled from his mouth in momentary forgetfulness of his omnipotence. Accordingly, he treats any mental influence framed as a command as an unacceptable order. Social attacks framed as supplication or humble suggestions bypass this defense, though any insincere displays necessitate the attacker use Manipulation rather than Charisma. The Storyteller remains final arbiter over whether a given attack bypasses this Charm or not.
         The basic defense of this Charm presents more of an inconvenience to social adversaries, who can easily stunt around it if they can swallow their pride or cultivate a taste for caustic irony. Against these clever opponents, the Infernal may reflexively spend four motes to add his Essence to his Dodge MDV for a scene.

      <description>When Infernals really stop to consider their power it becomes obvious that no one else's perspective or opinion actually matters. Sadly, the world is mad without its king and insistently dares otherwise. The nagging contradiction weighs on an Infernal's mind, gradually twisting her sanity inside out until it can once more recall the irrelevance of others. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm would spend one or more Willpower points to resist any form of mental influence, she may reflexively gain one point of Limit instead. She gains an extra Limit as usual if this is the first time she resisted unnatural mental influence in a scene. This Charm does not function during Limit Break. Only in the grip of true madness can Malfeas consider the terrible possibility that the universe might contain more perspectives than his own.</description>

      <description>Malfeas is not a patient Yozi. he can certainly wait when he must, as his surrender and imprisonment attest. However, the nature of the Demon City abhors the restraint implicit to inaction in any form. Whenever an Infernal who knows this Charm makes a social attack that would be considered an unacceptable order if defended against with Impervious Primacy Mantle, the attack becomes an unnatural mental influence costing one Willpower to resist. Flickers of hateful green fires emanate from the Infernal's eyes and mouth while using this Charm, curling up to hint at the outlines of a burning crown upon his brow ornamented with the central jewel of his caste mark. This display fades as soon as the Infernal finishes speaking his attack. This enhancement is not optional.</description>

         The heart of Malfeas burns jealously, invisible tongues grasping like talons at the lesser flames smoldering in other souls. This Charm enhances any standard (Perception + Awareness) roll to notice sensory details about a targeted being. In addition to whatever other information the character notices with any threshold of success, the Infernal also discerns the strength and aspect of the target's Essence relative to his own. The Storyteller should communicate this information numerically, even though the experience is more abstract and typically involves some form of personalized synesthesia.
         Anyone observing this Charm in use may notice a momentary green glint that flashes in the Infernal's eye with a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll at difficulty 4. This telltale sign does not make the Charm Obvious, so astute observers will have to draw their own conclusions. This Charm is not a means of bypassing stealth and costs no motes when activated by Infernals with Essence 4+, though it still requires a Charm activation.

         Some subordinates may accomplish acts worthy of notice from time to time. Whenever anyone uses any Essence-fueled supernatural power within (Essence x 10) yards, roll the Infernal's (Perception + Awareness) at a difficulty of (8 - the power user's Essence rating, minimum 1). Success means the Infernal senses where the power was activated relative to himself and the effect's minimum Essence. If he wishes further information, he may pay one mote to make the scrutinized effect Obvious to his senses, though doing so causes his eyes to flash like Insignificant Embers Intuition. Insignificant Embers Intuition may be used to enhance this Charm's activation roll, providing more information about the effect's aspect and the overall power of its source.
         Dim Irrelevancies Unveiled only reveals the location where a power was activated and does not track the source even if the power is ongoing.

      <description>The Green Sun beats hot on the continental districts and world-impaling skyscraper manses of the Demon City, yet it does not scorch the mirrored brass and garish verdigris entwining every wall and roof. Infernals with this Charm may similarly absorb and dissipate the damage inflicted by purely energy-based attacks. Examples include fire and other concentrated elemental Essence, Essence cannon fire or an Abyssal's Crypt Bolt Attack but not effects such as Death of Obsidian Butterflies. Skyfire-Seizing Repast can't defend against Holy attacks. Use of this Charm against a valid damage source reduces the post-soak damage by the Infernal's Essence. If this reduces the damage pool to zero dice, the attack is completely absorbed into the Infernal's anima and flares the banner to one level of display brighter than it was before, leaving her untouched. Otherwise, the remaining damage penetrates the anima flare normally. The Infernal also regains motes equal to the lesser of (her Essence x 2) or the (original post-soak damage of the attack x 2).</description>

      <description>As Malfeas folds his power and procrustean layers around a central flame that is his beating heart, so may an Infernal with this Charm ignite a primitive and insensate new soul within her Essence. This Charm functions as an additional Peripheral Essence pool capable of holding 10 motes, but it can only be refilled by Malfeas Charms that restore motes, which always refill this pool before adding to any other. The Infernal also gains the innate power to refill her (Willpower rating) motes to this pool for a reflexive cost of one mote, but she can't "jumpstart" herself again this way until a full day has passed since she last did so. She may give herself these motes while unconscious or otherwise incapacitated.</description>

      <description>The Infernal's blows spark and seethe with the acid-green radiance of Malfeas's heart, burning opponents. Green Sun Nimbus Flare may enhance any physical attack whose target is (Essence) yards or less away. If the attack inflicts any levels of damage, this Charm then inflicts two additional levels of unsoakable lethal damage from fiery tongues of Primordial Essence erupting from the wound. This damage is applied after the damage for the wound transmitting it, but still in Step 10 of attack resolution.</description>

      <description>The gods have much to answer for. This Charm permanently improves its prerequisite, allowing any attack enhanced by Green Sun Nimbus Flare to affect incorporeal beings as if they were solid. Spirits who suffer any levels of damage from the attack's secondary burn manifest and remain perceptible to normal senses as translucent apparitions for the rest of the scene, though they continue to lack solidity unless they actually materialize.</description>

      <description>Those struck down by Malfeas suffer deeper injuries than physical scars. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm activates Green Sun Nimbus Flare, she may pay an additional mote to improve the attack. If the flare inflicts any levels of damage against a being with a Willpower pool, it also consumes one Willpower. Victims who lose their last point of Willpower this way instantly form an intimacy of terrified awe toward the Infernal that can't be destroyed or even weakened until the victim has not directly perceived the Exalt for one full day.</description>

         Long ago, the gods bowed without bidding to their infinite betters. It is less satisfying now that divinities must be forced to surrender but will suffice to keep Malfeas amused. This Charm enhances a (Charisma + Presence) miscellaneous action against the target's Dodge MDV in which the Infernal commands a spirit to materialize before him. If successful, the target may pay a number of Willpower points equal to the Infernal's Essence rating (maximum five) to become immune to World Chains Geas for the rest of the scene. If it cannot or does not pay this cost, the spirit must acquiesce to the unnatural mental influence by using its next action to assume a lasting solid form. A failed roll to use this Charm also immunizes the target against further uses by that Exalt for the rest of the scene.
         The target is free to use further actions to reverse the materialization and is under no compulsion not to attack the Infernal. Spirits unable to achieve a materialized state ignore this Charm, as they would any impossible order.

         Although Malfeas is seldom subtle, he is a universal overlord and therefore infinitely capable of longterm strategies. This Charm permanently enhances Green Sun Nimbus Flare. Whenever an attack inflicts damage and would trigger secondary burns, the Infernal may suspend the eruption of Essence instead as a Sorcerous effect. The destructive energy remains invisibly embedded in the wound, though any form of Essence sight sees the Old Realm characters for "Mandate of Heaven" writ in bubbling green fire like an incandescent scar. So long as it remains, this mark also makes its bearer a native of Malfeas unless his supernatural nature is inherently opposed to it (like a non-Infernal Exalt).
         Whenever the victim next attacks (physically, socially or otherwise, at the Storyteller's discretion) the Infernal who placed the brand, intentionally or not, the scar bursts with all the deleterious effects that would have taken place originally, and the brand disappears. The victim intuitively understands that she must not oppose the Infernal when he places the brand, though without knowing the consequences.
         Unless prematurely dispelled, brands inflicted by this Charm endure until the death of the Infernal or the victim. Applying a new brand to a character the Infernal has already branded removes the first one; however, Infernals may brand any number of separate victims, and victims may be unfortunate enough to be branded by multiple Exalts.

         Malfeas honors his inferiors most when he accepts their adoration personally and feasts upon their awe. Infernals may activate this Charm whenever they directly observe anyone else make a declaration of loyalty or love toward them. If multiple characters synchronize their pledge (such as in a recited pledge of allegiance), the Infernal can acknowledge a group with Magnitude up to his Essence rating per activation. The character pledging loyalty need not do so happily, but must do so willingly. Insincere promises still provide a chance to use this Charm, incidentally converting deep-cover spies and moles to loyal followers as they repeat the binding lies of their oaths.
         Activating this Charm causes all targets to grow a brand exactly like one placed with Magnanimous Warning Glyph (but cannot override that Charm, and vice versa), save that the Infernal may decide whether the mark is visible or invisible, as well as where it is placed. This must be the same for all targets per activation. The act of burning the mark in place also gives its bearer an Intimacy of terrified awe toward the Infernal that does not count against a character's maximum number of sustainable Intimacies. The brand endures regardless of this Intimacy.

         When Malfeas strikes down the impudent, only the most fortunate die quickly. This Charm permanently improves Green Sun Nimbus Flare, causing all burns that Charm inflicts to automatically infect their victims with Green Sun Wasting (see p. 110).
         Infernals with Essence 4+ inflict a disease with penalties that start at full strength rather than building over the course of hours, though this does not accelerate other symptoms. With Essence 5+, Cold Fire Desolation Brand infects victims with Final Viridescence. At Essence 6+, the type of Final Viridescence is so extreme that only magical treatment can remove it; all Morbidity checks automatically fail absent such magic.

         The Infernal touches an object (see Exalted p. 213) and bathes it in the Essence of Malfeas. Although the item does not appear any different to normal senses, all forms of Essence perception can automatically sense the terrible power radiating from it. Any being that isn't native to Malfeas must check for exposure to Green Sun Wasting (see p. 110) every full hour that they spend within one yard of the tainted object. If the object is consumed, infection is automatic. The Virulence of this infection starts at 6 and drops by 1 per week. If a tainted object is scattered among non-tainted goods (such as when poisoning a well or a grain silo), the Storyteller should assign a reduced Virulence proportional to the level of contaminant present. Once there is more non-tainted material than tainted in an object, the effect is too dilute to do more than induce mild queasiness.
         Infernals with Essence 4+ may target themselves with this Charm as if they were objects. At Essence 6+, the speed of infection increases so that potential victims must make an exposure check as soon as they enter into range of a cursed object (and after every full hour of exposure thereafter).

         Though the Green Sun of the primeval epoch once nourished the land and life, the heart of Malfeas is mad and terrible, poisoned against all he once ruled. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal's anima radiates a burst of Malfean Essence that fills a radius of 50 yards. Normal senses can't detect this burst, though Essence users feel a characteristic, nauseating tingle as long as they remain among the lingering energies. Essence-based perception instantly recognizes the burst as if the Charm were Obvious.
         In its passage, the burst poisons the air, the land and even space itself. The healthy green of foliage sickens unnaturally over the span of a week with a fine patina of tarnish on every leaf. Any being that isn't native to Malfeas must check for exposure to Green Sun Wasting (see p. 110) every full hour that they spend within the blight at a Virulence of the Exalt's Essence rating. Each day that passes reduces the disease's Virulence by 1 until it fades completely and the area becomes healthy again. Whenever an Infernal who knows this Charm dies, she may reflexively bathe her surroundings in blight as per Sun-Salted Fields with no cost as a final act of spite.

         In the time before time, weapons knew their place, and even the sharpest blades dulled lest they scratch the King of the Primordials where he tread. The passing of Ages has diminished the world, but arsenals may yet be reminded of their place. This Charm can enhance any disarm attempt within the range limit of Green Sun Nimbus Flare. If the attack hits, the weapon superheats and glows brilliant green as if Ligier held it. Mortal weapons melt into slag or crumble to ash on the spot. Artifact weapons and those formed entirely of Essence are unharmed but remain superheated for a minute afterward, increasing the difficulty of the wielder's roll to resist the disarm attempt by 2.
         Anyone holding a superheated weapon suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage per action of contact (or fraction thereof). If the wielder forgoes the roll to maintain control and drops the superheated weapon immediately or that weapon is vaporized, he suffers no damage. Because the fire ignited by Rebuking Impudent Arms burns through Yozi power rather than heat alone, flame-resistant adversaries have as much to fear from this Charm as anyone else. Appropriate countermagic can cool a heated artifact back to normal temperature.

         The Infernal brandishes her weapon and salutes the sky with it, drawing and readying that weapon for use as part of activating this Charm. Green light falls upon the weapon from distant skies, superheating it as per Rebuking Impudent Arms for the rest of the scene. The Infernal becomes immune to the heat of her enchanted weapon once it chars one lethal level of damage from her hand. While this enchantment lasts, the Exalt may activate Green Sun Nimbus Flare to enhance any of the glowing weapon's attacks as an innate power rather than a Charm activation, though this still costs the usual motes.
         With a second purchase of this Charm, she can summon a spear of radiant green light in lieu of enchanting an existing weapon. The spear has all the statistics of an attuned dire lance with no magical material bonus and the following improvements: infinite Rate, aggravated damage to gods and the usual enhancements provided by a single purchase of this Charm. Like all infinite rate weapons, this spear can't attack in the absence of any dice pool to do so, even with additional successes supplied by Excellencies or other Charms.

         By the authority of the deposed King of the Primordials, the Infernal commands the universe itself to sunder a slain enemy into component motes. This Charm permanently improves Green Sun Nimbus Flare. Whenever a flare's damage is enough to kill a non-Yozi target, the surge of Essence spreads out from the wound like a bonfire doused with oil, growing exponentially brighter and hotter until nothing remains of the victim but glittering ash, a rising cloud of smoke in the shape of a fungal bloom and the victim's silhouette burned into the ground. Spirits can't reform from this demise, while Infernals with Essence 7+ can actually unravel the souls of beings with perfect reincarnation who normally resist permanent destruction, such as Dragon Kings and Jadeborn. However, not even Malfeas can sunder a Celestial Exaltation or permanently slay beings with Yozi-level immortality, such as Deathlords.
         Anyone who sleeps within 100 yards of a victim's shadow experiences horrific visions of the victim that impose a one-die penalty on rolls to regain Willpower upon waking. This radius contracts by one yard per century that passes until the being's Essence has been scattered to the reaches of eternity. That Malfeas only sentences hated enemies to 10,000 years of suffering shows the upper limits of his magnanimity.

      <description>The Infernal feeds the cosmic fires that rage within her. She inflicts up to (Essence) lethal levels of damage with Green Sun Nimbus Flare rather than a flat 2L. This damage is aggravated against gods. If she has Essence 6+, her surges inflict aggravated damage to all targets, though she may still vary the number of levels inflicted with each use. The bodies of victims killed by an augmented flare twist inside out as they burn, leaving jagged bone fragments penetrating like haphazard quills from between ropy masses of viscera and slabs of folded meat hot with boiled gore. The cadavers mummify over time but do not naturally decay. Natural animals will starve to death before they scavenge such remains, and even erymanthoi won't lick the marrow from the refuse. Curiously, starving humans seldom have such qualms and can eat the preserved corpses centuries later if they stumble upon them, but humans were always filthy creatures.</description>

         Once Malfeas was the Primordial King, his power and glory unconstrained by the crude limits of a body. Now, mutilated and caged in the prison of form, his cosmic might and boundless fury can only twist him toward more harmful expressions of his majesty. An Infernal who learns this Charm selects a package of (Essence x 10) points of temporary positive mutations as a "library" of options. She must allocate all of these points at the time of purchase, even if that means choosing mutations she doesn't really want as filler.
         Once allocated, the library remains fixed. However, raising Essence allows the Infernal to re-allocate all (Essence x 10) mutation points from scratch as though she just acquired the Charm. At Essence 10, the warlock may reallocate her mutations by spending one full day in either isolated meditation or a series of ancient, ecstatic dances.
         Whenever the warlock's anima banner reaches the 11+ mote level of expression, she reflexively gains eight points of mutations selected from her library as a temporary Desecration. Horns may curl from the warlock's forehead, leathery wings unfold from her back, or fanged maws open upon her body-whatever demonic features best express the Chosen's fury. She may not gain mutually-exclusive mutations at the same time. This transformation is not optional. In the unlikely event the Infernal cannot express a full eight points without going over (such as by only purchasing Abominations at Essence 3), she must get as close as possible. Once her anima subsides below the 11+ level, the mutations fade back into her body.
         By Rage Recast explicitly ignores the normal limit on how many positive temporary mutations a Desecration effect may bestow (see The Manual of Exalted Power-The Infernals, p. 103). Mutation points gained from the Charm do count toward the usual mutation point limit other temporary Desecration effects can bestow.
         If the character knows the Charm Fealty-Acknowledging Audience (see The Manual of Exalted Power-The Infernals, p. 116), then she may pay a surcharge of +5m when invoking that Charm to gift those who swear fealty to her with up to eight points of mutations she is capable of manifesting with By Rage Recast. This gift is a permanent Desecration.
         With Essence 3+, the Infernal may choose to retain her current mutations when her anima banner recedes. She may dismiss these mutations at any time her anima is below the 11-15 mote level of display with a diceless miscellaneous action, but must flare her anima anew to restore her mutations or change them out for a new suite of grotesqueries.

         When the gods turned Malfeas inside-out and gave him form, they exposed his inner monstrosity for all to see. Denied Creation, the Demon City must satisfy himself with dominion over his hateful flesh. If he must suffer the humiliation of physical existence, then the parameters of that body will be defined by the raging whim of the onetime Primordial King - and none other.
         The Infernal spreads his arms and collapses his anima banner into his flesh, producing a brief, blinding cataclysm of emerald flame. This explosion acts as a one-time environmental damage effect (Damage 3L, Trauma 1) to everything within three yards. When the smoke clears, the Exalt stands transformed, his demonic nature stamped unmistakably into his flesh.
         Devil-Tyrant Avatar Shintai has the following effects:
         • The warlock simultaneously manifests all (Essence x 10) points of mutations provided by this Charm's prerequisite. Devil-Tyrant Avatar Shintai explicitly ignores the normal restrictions on the number of positive mutations a Desecration effect may provide and does not count toward the mutation limit of other such effects. If By Rage Recast supplies mutations that are mutually exclusive to one another, he chooses which to manifest and which to keep inert within him. Mutual exclusivity is the only basis for a mutation not manifesting.
         • All Shaping effects which would transform the warlock's body become Obvious to his senses. He may reflexively reject any unwanted changes, even while unconscious or otherwise inactive.
         • The concentrated force of the Infernal's empyrean fury hardens his skin, adding (Essence) to his natural lethal and bashing soak.
         • The warlock adds (Essence) yards to his base movement and dashing distances.
         • Finally, the demonic power thrumming through his body increases the warlock's Strength by (Essence) for the purpose of feats of strength and attacking inanimate objects.

         The onetime King of the Primordials will not tolerate those who would stride past without stopping to show respect for his majesty, forcing them to kiss the ground if they will not do so of their own accord. This Charm may be activated whenever another character seeks to pass by the Infernal within (Essence) yards (the target must attempt to pass the Infernal; simply walking up, attacking, and then moving back would not suffice, nor may the Charm be activated if the Infernal is passing another character that is not attempting to bypass him); complementary units are never valid targets for this Charm. The warlock lashes out with a sudden lightning-fast attack in response; a favored method among Slayers is to slam an iron-hard arm into a target's throat, while Malfeas himself buckles the surface of his streets and slams the doors of his buildings into the faces of those who offend him. This is treated as a standard counterattack at full dice pool using a combat ability of the Infernal's choice. Ranged attacks are still limited to striking those who pass within the prohibited radius. Regardless of whether the attack inflicts any damage, a successful hit automatically knocks the target prone. Only one such counterattack may be directed at a single target per action. The Infernal adds three automatic successes to all attacks directed at characters knocked prone by this Charm.
         At Essence 3+ this Charm gains the Knockback keyword, and the warlock gains the option of knocking opponents back up to (Essence x 2) yards rather than simply knocking them down, if desired. Opponents who strike unyielding surfaces take dice of bashing (or lethal, for sharp surfaces) damage equal to half the number of yards they would have continued to travel if not brought up short, rounded up.

         Malfeas will tolerate nothing which stands between him and the execution of his will. Those who attempt to do so rarely survive to make the effort again. This Charm may enhance any attack directed at a character being protected by a Defend Other action. If the Infernal successfully strikes his original target, all of the attack roll's remaining successes are counted twice for the purpose of determining damage. If the warlock aborts to strike his target's defender instead, then he counts his Strength and remaining successes twice for the purpose of determining damage.
         At Essence 5+, attacks redirected against a defender count Strength and remaining successes three times rather than twice. At Essence 7+ this becomes a fourfold increase.
         A second purchase of this Charm grants the Infernal the option to pay a two mote surcharge in step 7 to knock the character he hits back on a successful strike. In addition to the Charm's usual effects, the unfortunate is hurled ([Charisma + Presence] x 5) yards, and if he strikes any unyielding surface, he takes dice of bashing damage equal to the number of remaining yards he did not travel (or lethal damage at the Storyteller's discretion, depending on the surface in question).

         Sometimes inferiors forget their place. Sometimes the conquered don't know when to stay down. They can be taught. To activate this Charm, the Infernal chooses an individual he has previously marked with Magnanimous Warning Glyph. The Charm costs zero motes if the target is an extra and four motes otherwise. The power of Screams as Prayers Reminder is inescapable, reaching across any distance or realm of existence through the arcane link of that mark. Wherever the victim is, her brand suddenly becomes visible to normal senses and remains so until Screams as Prayers Reminder ends, subverting her stealth as per a 4-7 mote Infernal caste mark display. The smoldering brand also hurts like a fresh vitriol burn, adding the warlock's Essence rating to the victim's current wound penalties. Whenever a victim suffering from an inflamed brand attacks the warlock, he becomes aware of the attack (precluding it from being unexpected). The Infernal may then choose to let the brand ignite as normal or persist in its inflamed state to prolong the victim's agony. Although this Charm isn't stackable, it may be separately activated to simultaneously torture multiple victims. Brands from different warlocks do not stack their wound penalty increase; only the worst applies.
         With Essence 5+, the cost to target mortals and natural animals also drops to zero motes.

      <description>Malfeas is invincible, immortal, and incomparable. Those who would dare offer evidence to the contrary will be ground to a paste between his layers as a lesson to others. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it gains motes under the following circumstances: The first time in a scene that the Infernal marks off his incapacitated health box with a certain type of damage (bashing, lethal, or aggravated), he gains ten offensive motes. This gain is cumulative - if the Infernal filled his Incapacitated health box with bashing damage, and then later in the same scene with lethal damage, he would gain a total of 20 motes. However, if he healed himself and then marked off the box with lethal damage again during that scene, he would gain no motes.</description>

         The volatile fury at the heart of the Demon City is a flame of such intensity that it can never be contained. An Infernal who learns this Charm gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of fifteen motes. Initially empty, the warlock may begin to fill it by activating this Charm. From that point onward, each time one of the Infernal's attacks are successfully parried or dodged, he gains a single offensive mote. As the warlock's inner fires burn hotter, his Overdrive pool becomes unstable. If the Exalt gains five or more offensive motes in a single action, make a difficulty 1 (Stamina + Resistance) roll to stabilize the Infernal's awesome power. For each mote over five, increase the difficulty of this roll by 1. If the Infernal succeeds on this roll, add an additional three motes to his Overdrive pool. If he fails, five of his Overdrive motes detonate in a torrent of emerald flames which erupt up from the vicinity of his ribcage, doing one unsoakable lethal health level of damage as it rips through his body.
         The Exalt may not gain offensive motes from this Overdrive if his attacks are not designed to kill his target. If he holds back one iota, Rage-Stoked Inferno Soul fails.

      <comment>On Rage-Stoked Inferno Soul: "I have had the idea for this Charm sitting on my hard drive forever, well before the invention of Overdrives or the new Essence-Gathering Temper. It wasn't anything like an Overdrive back then. It started out as a strange Extra Action Charm, and mutated into something which had this primitive Overdrive-like interaction with Green Sun Nimbus Flare involving stocking extra motes to power the Charm and volatile backfires. Needless to say, I abandoned the idea. Only when examining Infernals to roll out some Overdrives did I realize I had a fairly good basis for getting the concept across." -Ø</comment>

         Though it is true that, at one time, a being known as the Empyreal Chaos was forced to admit defeat, none can say the same of the Yozi called Malfeas. It seems unthinkable that one should ever vanquish the Demon City... yet the same was said of King of All Kings in the Time of Glory. Should the Infernal fall in battle with any offensive motes in his Overdrive pool, he may pay one mote, one Willpower as his final health level is checked off in step 10 and he becomes incapacitated. He falls, almost to a knee, or slouches to one side as if to topple, but stops himself. Suddenly his anima roars to the 16+ level of display as a local earthquake rips through the area for five miles. This tremor comes from within the warlock and sends emerald and crimson-tinged cracks racing across his skin to congregate around his blazing caste mark, while his eyes shine with all the furies there ever were. The legend of the Empyreal Chaos wreathes his chest, biceps and thighs and bounds his forehead like a crown. For the next action, the warlock is perfectly immune to all attacks and harm, but may not act, save to activate any one shintai he knows. If no shintai is activated, the Infernal effectively remains Inactive for that one action. When this action ends, the blaze dies down, and the Infernal's final horrific onslaught can begin.
         The Infernal's Overdrive pool immediately gains 10 motes. From that point forward, the Infernal will remain active, attacking, and unable to retreat until his Overdrive pool reaches zero. He may regain Overdrive motes during this time, but his pool empties at a rate of three offensive motes per action. During this time, the Infernal may not benefit from any magic which heals damage. Attacks which strike him during this time, which do not accrue more than (Infernal's Essence x 3) dice of post-soak damage fail to even register - he suffers no damage from them. Only attacks which cripple or dismember the outraged Slayer have a prayer of slowing him down.
         Finally, offensive Charms fueled by his Overdrive are reduced in cost by one mote, to a minimum of zero motes. The Infernal may not apply more than one zero mote Charm to any given attack, but he may stack any reduced-cost offensive Charms he can afford so long as they cost at least one mote.
         When the frenzy ends, the Infernal rolls (Stamina + Essence) against difficulty 5. Failure leaves the Infernal incapacitated; success restores the Infernal's incapacitated health level, although he may not activate Driven Beyond Death again within the scene. As a point of clarification, this Charm may only be triggered when the Infernal is truly incapacitated - for instance, marking off the Infernal's final health box with lethal damage would not permit him to trigger Driven Beyond Death if he had By Agony Empowered active.

         All of the Yozis are dancers without mortal peer, taught the art by their onetime King. Though it shames Ligier to see Malfeas cavort in his own streets, momentarily forgetful of his imprisonment and the insult inflicted upon him, the Demon City is still the greatest performer among the Yozis, and there is power to be found in his dance.
         This Charm permanently enhances a warlock's ability to evoke emotions with Performance-based socials attacks via dance. These hypnotic movements become an unnatural mental influence costing +1 Willpower to resist. Additionally, for a five-mote surcharge, a dance-based Performance action may be enchanted so witnesses influenced by it must linger and watch the warlock's performance to its completion (this Compulsion may be resisted like Respect Commanding Attitude; see Exalted, p. 202).

         The Infernal stokes the furnace of his stomach, igniting a corrosive Essence flame within his guts. He may consume any matter he can fit in his mouth and it nourishes him as if it were the finest repast. He can perfectly digest the most toxic or disease-riddled substances without any ill effects, though indestructible objects like most artifacts simply pass through his digestion unharmed (and without harming him). Use of this Charm tends to skew the Infernal's palate, giving him all manner of alien cravings. Matter consumed while using this Charm is digested immediately and doesn't become dangerous again within the body. This Charm is equally effective at addressing hunger and thirst.
         In lieu of enchanting themselves, Infernals may use By Hunger Nourished to enchant another being with a touch. If the target is not a native of Malfeas, she does not automatically acclimate to the taste of anything normally inedible to her, requiring a Stamina + Resistance roll to avoid vomiting immediately (difficulty 1-5 based on how vile the substance is). It is possible to provide such acclimation as part of activating the Charm, however, in which case the substance becomes the best-tasting food the target can remember eating. The Infernal may alternately impose a more limited "gift" that allows the target to eat one specific substance, but the target must roll to resist vomiting at difficulty 6 whenever she eats anything else for the duration of the Charm.
         Repeated use of this Charm to make a victim unable to eat anything at hand will eventually lead to fatal starvation. It is possible to select matter that is utterly inaccessible, like the tears of Saturn, though most Infernals stick with the old comic standby of making prisoners eat their own excrement. Though they might wish otherwise, targets with modified diets intuitively understand what they need to eat to survive.

         The Infernal presents his palm or caste mark toward an opponent within five yards and emits a blinding discharge of Essence from that point. Make an opposed roll of the warlock's (Dexterity + War) against the victim's (Wits + Awareness). If the Infernal wins, he chooses an opportune tactical moment and successfully blinds his target, searing the image of his iconic anima into her mind's eye. Otherwise, the target blinks or looks away just in time and is unaffected.
         Until the victim takes a diceless miscellaneous action to rub her eyes and blink fresh tears over the flashburn, she is as blind as if both her eyes had been removed (see Exalted, p. 152). The Infernal also applies a +3 relative Appearance bonus when making social attacks against a character fully blinded by this Charm from the afterimage of his anima, regardless of actual Appearance ratings involved. Cleaning out one's eyes is delicate work; the action can't be part of a non-magical flurry. Even after a character restores her sight, she still suffers a -1 internal penalty to all vision-based Perception rolls for the rest of the day. This penalty is not cumulative with successive applications of Tarnish Flash Technique.

      <description>Cities rise. Cities fall. Only Malfeas endures. Once an Infernal learns this Charm, she may pay an additional mote when activating Green Sun Nimbus Flare to attack a non-magical inanimate object (Exalted, p. 213). If the target suffers any damage from the secondary burn, the wound continues to burn from within, suffering one level of unsoakable lethal damage each tick until destroyed. If the warlock has a higher Essence rating than the Resources value of the object, it burns more quickly and is utterly destroyed on the tick following the Infernal's attack. During this period of disintegration, cracks spread throughout the object's surface, from which glittering green rays and wisps of acrid smoke emerge. Final destruction occurs violently as the object simultaneously burns and shatters. Witnesses may even hear the childlike whimper of the object's least god as its immortal existence loses all meaning.</description>

      <description>This Charm upgrades its prerequisite. The warlock gains the option to emit a burst over an expanded radius of one mile that fades at the rate of 1 Virulence per week. This burst is weaker, so potential victims only need to make an exposure check for every full day they spend in the area. Each dot of Essence the warlock has over 5 slows the rate of normalization as follows: per month (6), per season (7), per year (8), per decade (9) and per century (10). At Essence 7+, the blight inflicts Final Viridescence instead of Green Sun Wasting.</description>

         This Charm upgrades the spear conjured by repurchasing Vitriolic Corona Endowment. The summoned spear may fire blasts of cosmic energy as an alternative to close combat use. These blasts may be fired with a range increment of (Essence x 5) yards using Archery or Melee and require no ammunition or additional cost. Ranged attacks with the spear otherwise follow the same rules as attacking in close combat.
         With Essence 4+ the Infernal can hurl bolts with identical statistics from any part of his body, even without summoning the spear.

      <description>
         The Infernal squeezes his fist in the direction of an armored adversary as wisps of Primordial sunfire play about his fingers. This Charm is a ranged attack with an attack pool of (Charisma + Resistance + Essence) against a target within 50 yards. The attack can be dodged normally. If a non-natural weapon parries this attack (using DV or otherwise), Carapace Oven Trick misses but the defending weapon is automatically superheated as per Rebuking Impudent Arms. Since this heating does not accompany any active disarm attempt, the victim can accept the damage or drop the weapon as desired without having to make a roll to hold on. This superheating does not occur if the attack is parried with the assistance of a Charm which can block unblockable attacks or which possesses a Flaw of Invulnerability.
         If the attack hits, the victim's armor superheats bright green, damaging its wearer on contact as explained in Rebuking Impudent Arms. Non-magical armor vaporizes, but the broader surface area means it still inflicts one level of lethal damage as it does so. Magical armor is considerably harder to affect, requiring the warlock to have a permanent Essence greater than the target's artifact rating (or the minimum Essence of the Charm that created the armor). If it can be affected, magical armor remains superheated for five minutes, but offers better insulation than weapons by inflicting bashing damage instead of lethal. Unfortunately, armor can't simply be dropped the way a weapon can. Getting out before being cooked to death requires the usual actions to do so (see Exalted, p. 374). Appropriate countermagic can also cool the armor back to normal temperature instantly.

      <description>
         It is not sufficient to blight the land to subsume Creation into the Demon City. The very Essence of the world must yield in submission to the glory of Malfeas before he can feel free. Whenever an Infernal uses Radiant Fury Dissolution to shatter a demon, god or an Infernal Exalt within the bounds of a demesne or the central chamber of a Manse, Geomantic Redistricting Oblation alchemically transmutes the explosion of pain shards into something far worse. For this process to corrupt a demesne, the being must have an Essence rating higher than the site's rating. Manses are more stable and thus harder to corrupt, requiring a victim with a minimum Essence of (rating + 2). It is also possible to create a new level 1 Vitriol-aspect demesne within an area blighted by Sun-Salted Fields by shattering an Essence 6+ god, demon or Infernal on that location.
         If the above conditions are met, the horrid alchemy begins, shattering any hearthstones (if a manse) and changing the site's aspect toward the Malfean element of Vitriol over a period of days equal to its rating (or one month, if creating a new demesne). During this period of transition, the change can be reversed with appropriate counter-magic and any attempt to draw Essence from the site in any way yields no Essence. Instead, the high saturation of spiritual poison inflicts dice of bashing damage equal to the motes that would have been gained instead. All beings not native to Malfeas feel ill whenever they approach within one mile of the changing site, suffering a -1 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions as a Sickness effect. Once the transition completes, the process can't be undone with countermagic and the effects associated with the conversion abate. Manses grow a new hearthstone during the change, with powers that the Storyteller should create or approve based on the stone's rating and the nature of the spirit killed to start the change.
         Killing a city father this way in a manse located within that god's home city is even more spectacular, as the radiated discomfort penalizes everyone within the city for the next month (even if conversion finishes sooner). Appropriate countermagic only stops the aura if applied during the period of change; otherwise the grief must run its course. The death of any Incarna within the Jade Pleasure dome would affect Yu-Shan similarly, but the penalty would be -5 and would last for one year, driving all but the hardiest gods to evacuate.

         As this Charm activates, the Infernal's being evolves into pure Essence and expands at infinite speed to encompass the universe. For a moment, his feet tread the shinma and the wholeness of fate tangles about his limbs like tattered cobwebs. Time sits at his right hand and resurrection upon his left. He has become the Infinite Radiant Is, the supernal transcendence of all divinity, the Holy Tyrant, the King of the Primordials. It cannot last. The infinite gravitation of humiliation crushes him, layer upon layer, until he finds himself imprisoned within a body of shining brass and volcanic stone.
         The Demon Emperor form is slightly larger than the character's natural body, and is visually recognizable as the warlock to those few who can gaze upon its awful radiance and survive. It surges and bucks from within, constantly fracturing to release shafts of darting molten radiance, only to quickly reseal itself. Entire sections sometimes burst, the momentary rupture exposing smoking brass bones and a deadly emerald star where the Infernal's heart should be in the moments before the shell knits itself closed again. The character's anima flares to its full iconic state, expanding beyond all reason to encompass an area (Essence x 50) yards in radius. To watchers from afar, it may appear that some vast phantasmal behemoth moves across the land. This form confers the following features:
         • The warlock gains benefits identical to the second purchase of Viridian Legend Exoskeleton (this cancels and will not stack with already existing activations of that Charm), as well as an additional +10L/10B soak on top of that amount.
         • The interior of the Infernal's anima banner becomes toxic with the terrible might of his radiance, searing all within with terrible burns and deadly bleeding sores. The afflicted drown in blood as their lungs disintegrate and flesh putrefies. This (Damage [Essence / 2]B /action, Trauma 5) environmental hazard only harms animate beings. Victims may negate this damage with a Miscellaneous Speed 5, DV -2 action, prostrating themselves before the Infernal and pressing their foreheads to the ground in utter supplication (rising from prone immediately voids the protection such groveling affords). Doing so automatically bestows an Intimacy of terrified awe upon the supplicant (irresistible due to her voluntary submission).
         • Those who dare to gaze directly upon the Infernal's awful radiance forfeit their lives. Looking upon the warlock's face automatically inflicts Green Sun Wasting (targeting the Infernal while averting one's eyes imposes a -2 internal penalty).
         • Such is the mercy of Malfeas that the warlock sometimes does not destroy his vassals. The Infernal may shield up to a Magnitude of his Essence rating in individuals chosen at the time of activation, whether a single unit or a series of disparate individuals. The warlock may reflexively revoke this protection from anyone at any time.
         An Essence 6+ repurchase affects dematerialized beings, upgrades the anima banner's size to (Essence x 100) yards, and increases its Damage to (Essence)B.

         It is fortunate that the Unconquered Sun took Creation from Malfeas, rather than forcing him to give it to the gods. Otherwise, all might burn to ash. To activate this Charm, the Infernal focuses his wrath on some non-magical object or structure that he once owned and deliberately gave to another individual. Wherever that object is in any realm of existence, it chars in a flash of emerald fire, leaving only a hardened statue of coal roughly half the size of the item and only vaguely shaped in its likeness. The statue crumbles with the lightest force (Soak 0B/0L; 1 level of damage needed to obliterate it to black dust). If the target belongs to a Celestial Exalt, the Infernal must make a Willpower roll at a difficulty of the owner's Essence to destroy the object; failure permanently immunizes the gift against the warlock's wrath. Malfeas long ago destroyed all in Creation that he could burn with this Charm. All that remains is beyond his power to touch.
         The fire unleashed by this Charm does not harm anything other than the intended target, so a sword burnt to ash does not sear the hand that holds it. The blast is an unblockable and undodgeable attack against the bearer of the target item and can be defended against as such.
         With Essence 5+, the Infernal may destroy magical items he gave to others, but only if he created those items himself or oversaw the team of workers that built them (as in the case of most manses).
         A repurchase at Essence 6+ allows the Infernal to obliterate any number of valid targets of this Charm within a 10 mile radius, setting the epicenter up to (Essence x 10) miles away.

      <description>The Principle of Hierarchy recognizes the totality of truth. This Charm may be used to test any statement the Exalt reads or overhears and provides the Infernal with certain knowledge of whether the statement was presented as a complete truth. Any intentional deception or meaningful omission of relevant data in any part of the tested statement returns the same negative response, so it is best to test a long statement frequently to isolate where the truth breaks down. If this Charm contests another, add the Infernal's Essence rating in bonus successes to the roll-off. Truth is measured from the perspective of the speaker rather than based on objective truth. Factual Determination Analysis does not supply the truth along with its binary measure.</description>

         It is the nature of She Who Lives In Her Name to understand all patterns less than herself. To use this Charm, an Infernal chooses a sapient being within (Willpower x 10) yards. The target experiences sudden phantom pain as though from vivisection and knows that some external force seeks to invade her mind, but not who. Roll the Infernal's (Perception + Investigation + Essence) with an external penalty of the target's Dodge MDV. If no successes remain, the Infernal loses an additional one Willpower from the frustration of inconceivable failure. If successful, the Infernal mentally probes the target's mind and learns the answer to one question of his choice. The victim does not experience the probe as a question per se, but understands the intent of the intrusion and relives flashes of rapid-fire memories that the Infernal simultaneously experiences and interprets. The defender's player supplies the answer and must do so truthfully without meaningful omissions, as enforced by the Storyteller. The defender may spend one Willpower to ignore the unnatural mental influence of that probe attempt or three Willpower to gain total immunity to all uses of this Charm for the rest of the scene. Victims of Analytical Modeling Intuition do not have to reveal any information about their emotional state and may take a "just the facts" approach to keep such details private. Forcing a character to relive painful or humiliating memories is extremely stressful, imposing a -2 internal penalty on the victim's next roll to regain Willpower from sleep. This penalty does not cumulatively worsen with repeated exposure.
         With a second purchase of this Charm, the Infernal may touch an inanimate object to rip answers from the object's least god. No roll is required, nor can the god resist, but the Exalt only learns information he could glean with a threshold of five successes on a successful Investigation roll at any difficulty. Least gods only perceive events that directly relate to their limited domain, so the information they have is likewise limited. Finally, use of this Charm to rip experiences out of a least god's mind sends the deity into quivering catatonia for an hour, preventing it from being interrogated again during this time.
         A third purchase of this Charm reduces the activation cost to one mote if the Infernal targeted the same person using Analytical Modeling Intuition on his last action. Failure to continuously renew the effect or choosing a new target resets the Charm's usual cost.

      <description>To dare voice an alternate point of view to the Principle of Hierarchy is to invite her wrath and curiosity both. Wise enemies fear the latter more. This Charm may be activated as a counterattack in response to any unnatural mental influence directly imposed in real time by a sapient being (i.e., no delayed effects or written influence). The mental influence does not need to succeed to be eligible for counterattack and resolves normally. Meanwhile, the Infernal gets to scan the attacker's own mind as if using Analytical Modeling Intuition to pose a question. Because the attacker already established a mental connection, the Infernal adds her Essence rating in bonus successes to her attack roll. With Essence 4+, this Charm can be used in response to natural mental influence as readily as unnatural.</description>

         Before the gods and their Chosen debased Creation's original language with babbling, broken dialects of mutual unintelligibility, all of existence spoke as one. The Principle of Hierarchy will restore that linguistic order. Upon touching an intelligent being and activating this Charm, the Infernal instantly imprints the target with knowledge of Old Realm in the Malfean dialect and temporarily excises knowledge of all other languages. This artificial fluency extends to writing if the target has Lore 1+ and does not increase the target's Linguistics rating, but it prevents acquisition of other languages until dispelled. Essence-wielding targets may spend one Willpower to reduce the Charm's duration to a scene or three Willpower to cancel it outright. Non-extra mortals can reduce duration to one day for three Willpower.
         A second purchase of Unshattered Tongue Perfection at Essence 3+ allows the Infernal to target a unit with Magnitude less than his Intelligence rating rather than an individual by touching or being the leader and paying an increased cost of 15 motes and a Willpower. All unit members in the same realm of existence are affected as though individually targeted by the Charm, though the Infernal is not affected so long as he already knows Old Realm. Countermagic against one affected member only frees that member, not the whole. It is possible to effect subunits of larger units in order to convert them piecemeal by attacking lower in the chain of command.
         Whether targeting an individual or unit, those affected with the second version of this Charm base Appearance modifiers for experiencing or imposing mental influence on relative Essence ratings rather than relative Appearance, even imposing this context on unaffected characters with whom they interact. Affected characters also treat the social attacks of higher-ranking members of any unit they belong to as unnatural mental influence costing two Willpower to resist. Victims of this Charm may go to the effort of breaking an Intimacy to leave the organization and reduce its hold over them, though such efforts often fail in face of compulsions from said superiors to remain with the unit and stay loyal.

         It is unfair to say that She Who Lives In Her Name is without Virtue. Like her fellow Yozi Adorjan, the Principle of Hierarchy merely understands the bigger picture. Infernal Exalts can purchase this Charm once per dot of Integrity (to a maximum of four times), with each purchase enhancing one Virtue rated 5+. The choice can't be altered, but the Charm's effects recede if the Infernal lacks a sufficient Virtue rating for whatever reason.
         The Infernal regains one channel for each Virtue aug-mented by this Charm once per day at sunset. Additionally, whenever an Infernal would roll dice for a Virtue enhanced by a purchase of this Charm (whether as a pool by itself or bonus dice from a channel), the Charm converts these dice into automatic successes. This isn't optional, so characters must always spend Willpower to resist the urges of extreme Virtue. See below for how Virtues express themselves dif-ferently through this Charm.
         Lawgivers have a Charm "Epic Zeal of (Virtue)" that has identical effects, but requires Integrity 4 and any Integrity Excellency as a prerequisite. This is not the only form of extreme Virtue Solars of the First Age explored, only one transhumanist paradigm.
         Compassion: The Infernal cares for other people as she would care about the chips of bone or fibers of sinew that compose someone she cares about. She certainly does not wish the pieces harm, but places their wellbeing far below the health of the whole. The specifics of the Infernal's greater good must be worked out with the Storyteller and must make sense for the character's Intimacies and other Virtue ratings. Within this expansive ethos, she can sacrifice millions of lives to save billions more. She can channel Compassion on any action that serves her greater good, even actions that oppose smaller conceptions of Compassion. However, she must spend Willpower to take actions that oppose the greater good, even those actions that demonstrate immediate Compassion.
         Conviction: Inhuman extremes of Conviction do not wildly deviate from the ethics of mortal paragons except by degree. Therefore, the applicability of Conviction channels does not increase. However, whenever mental influence seeks to alter the emotional context of any of her Intimacies, lessen them outright or alter her beliefs or memory with an Illusion effect, the Exalt may spend one Willpower and one Conviction channel to perfectly dodge that influence. Doing so breaks any ongoing effects from the dodged influence, and this may be done later to throw off influence as an alternative to dodging the initial social attack or other source. In addition to the normal behavioral prohibitions on high Conviction, an Infernal with this Charm can't knowingly act against any of her Intimacies unless she has spent Willpower to act against her beliefs for a scene.
         Temperance: With extreme self control comes absolute clarity of purpose. Whenever mental influence would build an Intimacy or exert an Emotion effect over her, the Infernal may dodge by spending one Willpower and one Temperance channel. This defense follows the same overall rules as the dodge afforded by Cosmic Transcendence of Conviction apart from the types of influence it defends against. The range of actions that extreme Temperance can enhance does not improve. Unfortunately, her ascetic devotion also requires her to spend Willpower to act dishonestly or show bias in any situation, not just matters of importance. She must also spend Willpower to break promises, even those lacking that formality and solemnity of a sworn oath.
         Valor: The Infernal knows no peers or superiors and, therefore, ceases to understand fear as a meaningful concept. If she would somehow fail a Valor check despite 5+ automatic successes, she still succeeds with threshold of one. She treats all mental influence that would instill fear or alter her behavior through playing on fears as unacceptable orders, also terminating any fear-based Intimacies upon purchase of this Charm. The Storyteller decides when this defense applies. Cosmic Transcendence of Valor does not broaden the range of actions that Valor channels can aid, nor does it broaden the scope of prohibited actions.

      <description>Faced with any physical attack, the Principle of Hierarchy may reshape reality to produce a phenomenon or event capable of neutralizing the attack. This Charm is a perfect parry against any attack the Infernal can perceive, even unblockable attacks. The default manifestation is an orb of crystalline fire that appears in the path of the attack, shattering to stop the blow or projectile just before it hits the Exalt. Where the sphere shatters, a ripple of bent space flows out like a stone dropped into a pond. It is possible to manifest any instant duration effect that could provide a parry, however, such as a spray of water to snuff out a firewand's torrent or a concussive thunderclap that knocks aside an incoming arrow. Such variations are stunts, so creative use can reduce the cost of the Charm to match the perfect defenses of other Yozis. Counter-Conceptual Interposition is vulnerable to the Imperfection of the Principle of Hierarchy.</description>

         It is not the place of the universe to dictate the identity of the Principle of Hierarchy. Whenever a Shaping effect alters an Infernal with this Charm in a manner her player does not approve of, the character's Essence reasserts its integrity like an immune system waging war on a plague. The offending Shaping reverses itself after one hour, during which time the character suffers a -1 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions from the psychic effort of resistance and can't be further changed by continued exposure or reapplication of the same Shaping effect during this time. Thus, healing from Wyld-induced mutation ensures immunity to further mutation while recovering, but Shaping inflicted by a Charm would only leave the Infernal immune to that singular Charm. Until the Shaping reverses itself, the Exalt must still contend with all effects of his changed state. If the character suffers multiple undesired Shaping effects, they heal back in whatever order the Infernal's player chooses, but only one effect heals at a time. It is possible to initiate healing against Shaping the character originally permitted, should the change become undesirable.
         A second purchase at Essence 3+ shortens the interval of regeneration to one minute. A third purchase (still at Essence 3+) allows instantaneous recovery for a reflexive cost of two motes, as the Infernal begins changing back before the offending Shaping fully resolves.

      <description>Though she is not kind, She Who Lives In Her Name cannot abide seeing others twisted against her understanding of their nature. Upon activating this Charm and touching a target being or object, the target becomes infused with the Essence of perfected hierarchy, and the Infernal intuits all Shaping effects that have altered the target as if the effects were Obvious to her. She may select any number of these effects as undesirable in whatever order she chooses. The infusion begins sequentially reversing these effects at the same rate as Ego-Infused Pattern Primacy operates (but no faster than an interval of one minute). Once this list has been corrected, Pattern-Reassertion Touch abates. If an Infernal knows other Charms that enhance the scope of what Ego-Infused Pattern Primacy can fix, the same options apply to enhance the range of this Charm.</description>

         The restoration of the changed self takes first priority above other repairs, but lesser defects may yet mar greater designs if left unchecked. This Charm is actually a cluster of Charms that can be learned in any order, each of which broadens Ego-Infused Pattern Primacy to be able to repair another state. Note that each interval of healing can only reverse one undesired effect. Possible options for Wholeness Rightly Assumed include: Crippling, Sickness and Poison.
         Damage is also an option and one that requires further explanation and repurchase for maximum effectiveness. With a single purchase, each interval of healing regenerates one level of bashing damage. A second purchase allows lethal damage to be healed. Healing instantly from damage is costlier and less total than healing back from other deleterious states, costing three motes for a level of bashing and five motes for a level of lethal.

         The spinning orbs of She Who Lives In Her Name have no hands with which to grapple and impose order on the world. They are not so crude. With this Charm active, the Infernal may move other objects with his mind as though manipulating them with his own body, exerting force or even lifting objects and carrying them through the air at speeds up to his own current velocity. His telekinesis trails Obvious ripples of spatial distortion and white light as prehensile tendrils of mental force. This Charm has a Dexterity equal to his Willpower and a Strength equal to his Essence. The associated Ability to use this Charm is Occult, whether for attacking with direct force or hurling objects, or to determine effective (Strength + Athletics) total for a mind-powered feat of strength. If a floating weapon is wielded this way, the Ability is the lower rating of the normal trait and Occult, and all actions using the weapon suffer a -3 external penalty. Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, the Essence for this Charm must be committed, but the effect may also be terminated at will by ending this commitment. Mind-Hand Manipulation can move perceived incorporeal beings and objects, but its effective Strength is halved.
         Moving objects with Mind-Hand Manipulation requires the same actions as doing so normally. All actions suffer range penalties like an attack with a range interval of (Willpower + Essence). Objects that have been lifted into the air fall when the action taken to move them ends, though up to (Essence) separate objects may be held stationary between actions, reflexively levitated through force of will. Grabbing anything that resists requires a clinch attack, but opponents who win control of a clinch do not get to grapple the Exalt and may only choose to escape. Moreover, clinches can only be maintained with renewed control rolls as normal, so victims can't be held aloft with merely reflexive effort. Unlike most ranged attacks, telekinesis granted by this Charm may be used defensively to deflect projectiles and weaken blows, as represented by the parry option provided by the Charm's Defense rating.
         Infernals with Essence 3+ add a third attack option, in which they can focus their mental force to scalpel sharpness with which to vivisect those who displease or intrigue them. Repurchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ allows an Infernal to spend one Willpower whenever a telekinetic attack would inflict two or more actual levels of damage. Invoking this power replaces all damage with a Crippling amputation of the Exalt's choice (see Exalted, p. 152, for examples). Such injuries self-seal as though cauterized and do not even bleed. Telekinetically wielded weapons can't amputate victims this way.
         Telekinetic Blow: Speed 5, Accuracy (Willpower + Occult), Damage (Essence)B, Defense (Willpower + Occult), Rate (Essence), Range (Willpower + Essence)
         Telekinetic Clinch: Speed 6, Accuracy (Willpower + Occult), Damage (Essence)B, Rate 1, Range (Willpower + Essence)
         Telekinetic Blade: As Telekinetic Blow, but Damage (Essence)L piercing (aggravated to creatures of the Wyld).

      <description>Malfeas relishes gaudy displays of power, but She Who Lives In Her Name does not need shallow theatrics to justify herself. Unseen Force Application enhances its prerequisite by removing the Obvious keyword at will, allowing the Charm to move objects invisibly without giving away who is responsible. Onlookers can still make educated guesses that the Infernal has attacked through scrutiny of his body language; this requires a difficulty 4 (Wits + Awareness) roll as a miscellaneous action, with success revealing that the Infernal has attacked via some unseen means and allowing the witness to recognize whenever he does so again later in the scene. The tingling surge of Essence that precedes the telekinetic force like an aura still allows Essence-using targets of telekinetic attacks to defend normally, though at an additional -2 DV penalty from lacking a clear sensory impression of the attack. Mortals can't block these attacks and are at -3 DV to dodge them.</description>

         All of existence is a weapon to the opened mind. This Charm can enhance any direct telekinetic attack using Mind-Hand Manipulation. Instead of exerting damage through projected force, a successful hit allows the Infernal to shape any instant-duration, damaging phenomenon into existence to injure the target, even if the phenomenon is wholly imagined and has no natural counterpart in Creation's patterns. It is theorized that truly fantastic and seemingly impossible attacks refract principles lost to the Three Spheres Cataclysm.
         The default attack from this Charm is a pulse of disintegrating white fire, but the Infernal can conjure lightning, grinding earth, boiling acid mist, low-frequency screams that split bowels or new colors of light that erase mass. The nature of the effects can alter stunts, but the actual statistics of the attack follow basic telekinetic attack options. Should the attack kill the target, an appropriate Shaping can transmute her corpse to any other matter with a Resources value less than the Infernal's Essence. Thus, a golden fog that turns flesh to gold may leave alloyed statues of gold glistening with tarnished inclusions of emerald brass. Characters immune to Shaping effects can't be hurt by this Charm.
         This Charm costs one mote and One Willpower to enhance a telekinetic clinch. A grapple augmented this way creates a lingering snare or binding that maintains the clinch using the Exalt's normal traits to do so. Independent Shaping clinches apply successes equal to half their dice pool in lieu of rolling and can only attempt to hold their target immobile. If the clinch is broken or dispelled or the creator wishes, the confinement shatters and its prisoner is free to act immediately. A maximum of (Essence) independent clinches may be maintained at one time.

         The Primordials built Creation from the chaos of the Wyld. Tapping into this legacy, an Infernal with Constructive Convergence of Principles may give form to the inchoate. Except as noted, this Charm duplicates the Solar Charm Wyld-Shaping Technique (see Exalted, p. 216) and is similarly limited to Shaping within a radius of (Essence) miles. Unlike the Lawgivers, the dice pool for this Charm is (Willpower + Essence). This action may be enhanced by the Excellencies of She Who Lives in Her Name as though the dice pool was a combination of (Attribute + Ability). All beings created by this Charm are inherently creatures of darkness in accordance with the Yozi Essence that gave them life. Spending successes equal to a First Circle demon's Essence rating on the "create people" option allows the Exalt to spawn an unbound heroic member of that race that comes into existence with an Intimacy of loyalty to its creator and whatever Motivation he decides to imprint on it. This Charm may be used in the Demon Realm as though the Middlemarches, but the Yozis are very touchy about having their bodies mutilated by Exalted, so one will actively block efforts to Shape any modifications to its terrain unless the changes closely fit the Yozi's nature and aesthetic. The broken Primordials are indifferent to the creation of wealth, people or artifacts within themselves.
         A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 4+ upgrades it with all of the effects bestowed by Wyld Cauldron Technology (see Exalted, p. 217). A third purchase at Essence 5+ allows regions of Creation to be shaped as if the Bordermarches, though demesnes can't be formed within Creation until the Infernal has Essence 7+, and all must have an Infernal aspect. Use of this Charm in Creation is a Blasphemy effect.

      <description>It is the will of the Principle of Hierarchy that she not be attacked. Who can gainsay her? Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal's anima crystallizes into a force construct around her, glowing at the eight to ten mote level of display. Infernals who know Unseen Force Application can create invisible shields if preferred. The Charm provides a shield DV bonus of the Infernal's Essence rating, which is not cumulative with other cover benefits (only the best modifier applies). Even better, direct telekinetic attacks using Mind-Hand Manipulation are DV -0 actions with Force-Suppression Barrier active. Whenever a ranged attack completely misses the Infernal, the projectile slows to a stop as the shield strips all energy and inertia from it and drops harmlessly to the ground as the tick ends.</description>

      <description>By hardening natural law into a tangible force, the Principle of Hierarchy defines her environment to aid allies and hinder enemies. This Charm may only be activated on the Infernal's action tick until he has Essence 5+, at which point he may use it in Step 2 of attack resolution to defensively create constructs in the path of attacks. The Charm can't be used more than once per tick for any reason. Upon activation, the Infernal chooses an origin point no greater than (Essence x 10) yards away. Translucent white light expands from that point, crystallizing into a single-layer construct of solid force whose dimensions can be arrayed as a wall, sphere, ovoid or anything in between of comparable simplicity. No dimension of the construct can exceed (Essence x 20) yards across. If characters do not wish to be trapped on a particular side of the barrier and they have a sufficient move rate to cross to the desired side, they may do so before the light hardens. In addition to being vulnerable to countermagic, constructs made with this Charm are inanimate objects with (Essence x 4) bashing and lethal soak and are destroyed upon suffering any damage. The Infernal can also dismiss them at will. The barriers are equally solid to material and incorporeal objects and provide usual cover, but their creator can move through them as if they were incorporeal whenever he wishes to do so. Attacking through the barrier isn't possible. Once created, constructs are stationary and can't be moved, only destroyed.</description>

      <description>From above She Who Lives In Her Name looks down on the messy chaos of a world desperate for her order. The Infernal's anima crystallizes and cracks, releasing a shard of light that grows into a narrow single-person platform that floats in mid-air, waiting for its creator to step on and claim it. The platform has soak and other traits as per a construct fashioned with Crystal-Fire Barrier Technique. If the Infernal steps on it with Mind-Hand Manipulation active, his feet adhere, and he gains the ability to hover and fly at up to ([Essence rating] x [natural ground speed]). The platform provides 50% cover from below. Should the Exalt suffer any knockback or knockdown while flying (or if the platform is destroyed by damage), this Charm deactivates and must be reactivated prior to hitting the ground to avoid impact. Hitting the platform deliberately requires a called shot at no penalty. If the directed attack hits the Infernal, it hits the platform and applies damage to it instead.</description>

         She Who Lives In Her Name needs no other habitation or external aid to work her genius. Whenever an Infernal has this Charm's prerequisite active, she can Shape her telekinetic force to serve in place of all tools required for Ability-based actions (but not raw materials), though this doesn't quicken task completion. Weapons can't be emulated; the Principle of Hierarchy has other Charms for that. Otherwise, "tool" is a broad term, encompassing musical instruments, writing implements, etc.
         The actual effects of the enhanced action take place via precise alteration of reality, so forging a lump of metal into a sword would involve levitating the raw ore, searing it red-hot and stretching the slag to its desired shape. By default, this Charm only provides the equivalent of a basic workshop. Subsequent purchases of the Charm at higher Essence ratings upgrade the benefits to more sophisticated facilities: master's workshop (Essence 4+, two purchases); flawless workshop (Essence 6+, three purchases); ideal workshop (Essence 7+; four purchases). See The Books of Sorcery Vol. III - Oadenol's Codex, pages 27-28, for more information on workshop types.

      <description>The Principle of Hierarchy does not wait to recheck the perfection of her plans. Implementation is efficiency. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm emulates tools with Tool-Transcending Constructs to enhance or allow an action, that action is accomplished at a speed factor of the Exalt's Essence rating. Thus, Essence 3 means such tasks may be completed three times as fast. Time dilates and warps around the affected target, quickening correct assembly to higher patterns, completion of a surgery, etc.</description>

         There is no difference between physical and mental force. The crushing of opposition must be absolute. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm would inflict two or more levels of damage to a target with direct attacks using Mind-Hand Manipulation, the Exalt knows whether the target has any Willpower points remaining and may choose to forgo all damage to drain one Willpower instead. If this drain reduces a target with lesser Essence to zero Willpower points, her will is broken (see Exalted, p. 174).
         Mortals and natural animals broken in this way become hollowed mockeries of themselves. Such wretches have no Virtues and automatically succeed/fail at Virtue rolls as per an automaton. Their original Motivations disappear, replaced by the Policy of whatever Magnitude 3+ social unit each victim is most closely affiliated with. A victim's player chooses which unit her will subsumes into, subject to Storyteller veto. Acting against the best interests of the unit whose Policy the victim gains becomes an unacceptable order for her. With Essence 4+, breaking a mortal can inculcate her with a Policy as described or impose any logical extrapolation of the Infernal's Urge instead. The only way to escape this altered state is to break the mortal's will anew by means other than this Charm.
         A mortal victim broken by an Essence 5+ Exalt dies as the totality of her being dissolves into white fire. When it dims, the victim appears unburned and completely healthy with the usual modifications to Virtues and Motivation, but this is not the same being. The new entity shares memories with and is a perfect copy of the original down to the last freckle, but the thing that replaces her is a creature of darkness with no soul. If killed, its Essence dissipates back into that of Creation like a person shaped from the Wyld.

         Creation was built to reflect the glorious order embodied by She Who Lives In Her Name, from the movement of the constellations to the closed circle of life and death. Taking up the least expression of the Pyrian Flame's perfect motion, the Infernal becomes a reflection of this truth.
         Upon activating Orbital Impact Storm, the warlock seizes a clattering maelstrom of loose objects from the surrounding environment-stones and chairs, dinner plates, hammers, broken fence-posts, and any other nearby bric-a-brac (objects carried by individuals and all attuned artifacts are exempt from being appropriated in this manner, as are objects too large or heavy for the average adult mortal to lift with one hand). If necessary, the Infernal may even rip cobblestones loose from streets or bricks from walls, inflicting (Essence) levels of unsoakable damage in the process; objects and structures with a soak greater than 8L are immune to such vandalism. This Charm cannot be activated if the Storyteller decrees that the environment lacks appropriate objects to work with, though players are reminded that two-point stunts allow dramatic editing of the scenery.
         The seized objects hang in midair for a moment. Then the newly-formed constellation of debris begins to orbit the Infernal at ever-increasing speeds, pulverizing those foolish enough to attempt to close with the warlock. This constitutes an environmental hazard (Damage 4L/action, Trauma 2) covering a sphere with a radius of (Essence) yards around the character. Even blunt objects inflict lethal damage at the speed generated by Orbital Impact Storm. Opponents may safely navigate the storm if their Dodge DV is higher than the Infernal's (Willpower x 2). Additionally, it becomes difficult to target the Infernal through the whirling maelstrom, as blades are knocked askew and arrows snapped in half before they can reach her flesh; attacks suffer an external penalty of (Infernal's Essence / 2, round up).
         Normally, action-interval environmental hazard exposure resolves after the victim's DV refreshes but before anyone acts on the tick. However, the storm created by this Charm damages victims after resolving all actions taken during the tick, meaning that characters agile enough to avoid the debris must take care not to penalize their Dodge DV to the point that they get hit.
         Unlike most Sorcerous Charms, the warlock may deactivate Orbital Impact Storm voluntarily. This may be done peacefully with a diceless miscellaneous action, freezing the suspended objects in place a split second before dropping them. Alternately, she can reflexively pay 5 motes to hurl shrapnel in all directions as a one-time environmental hazard (Damage 5L, Trauma 3) with a radius of (Willpower x 5) yards. This terminates the Charm and does not count as a Charm activation. Opponents may avoid the debris outright if their Dodge DV is higher than the Infernal's (Willpower + Essence).
         Essence 3+ Infernals can purchase this Charm a second time, extending its duration to one day (or indefinite with Essence 5+).

         She Who Lives In Her Name feels something like pity for humans. They are crippled amputees, incapable of reaching beyond their physical forms. It isn't really pity, of course, but rather an acute and targeted awareness of her superiority and the necessity of upgrading lesser beings to her specifications. The Green Sun Princes who learn this Charm perform a great service, serving as honored prototypes of humaniform transmogrification even as they civilize themselves.
         This Charm permanently upgrades Mind-Hand Method in the following ways:
         • The Charm may be used to protect others with Defend Other actions out to its maximum range rather than the usual (Dexterity rating) yards.
         • The Charm can be used to deliver Touch effects as though the emanated force is part of the Infernal's body.
         • The Infernal adds +2 to his Parry DV using Mind-Hand Method while taking a Guard action. With Essence 4+, this benefit also applies while using Defend Other to protect someone.

         The Whispering Flame embodies the perfection of design and order as does no other. She pities the world for being less perfect than herself, and imposes her nature upon it as an act of mercy.
         This Charm permits the warlock to re-order the land around her to reflect the principle of hierarchy, shifting the position of trees and walls, straightening or bending roads and rivers, reconfiguring the arrangement of buildings or moving them altogether to express the symmetrical perfection of a greater design. The Infernal may reorder the landscape in any manner she chooses, with the following limitations:
         The changes she demands occur gradually, over the course of the next hour, too slowly to inflict damage on any living thing. The Infernal cannot intentionally create new landscape features - she only reconfigures what is already there. The Charm cannot reshape a demesne, the Wyld, or any area within ten miles of the border of another landscape that has been reshaped through Chirality Prohibition Index or Holy Land Infliction. She might reconfigure a small village into a series of staggered circles around a central green, or into a rigid, balanced grid. An orchard could be rewoven into a perfect circular border of trees around a central field whose grass has been ranked into impressed-circles which confer the sacred order of the principle of hierarchy. Even the sky conforms to the symmetry of She Who Lives in Her Name, channeling clouds into a slow spiral around the central point of her design. The imposed changes span a circular area around the Infernal with a radius of (Willpower x 10) yards.
         The changes, when viewed from above, must reflect a greater symmetry with the rest of the world. This symmetry is subject only to the superior perspective of the warlock, who exudes the truth of her Essence into the pattern of existence. Others who look upon the Infernal's design may see only a mystifying sprawl of indecipherable but tantalizing meaning. Such are the limits of their minds that they cannot understand the order the warlock seeks to bring - though they wish to.
         Nearby mortals within one mile become fascinated by the sacred geometry of the Whispering Flame, and will settle in and around the edges of the symmetrical landscape. After each week an individual spends lingering within a mile of the affected area, they are automatically subjected to a social attack with a dice pool of the warlock's (Essence + Occult). Success counts as a scene spent working toward building an Intimacy of loyalty toward a new social unit�a cult dedicated to the study and veneration of the land's sacred design. This unnatural mental influence may be resisted for two Willpower.
         Once a character has gained this loyalty, she must follow the Policy of the cult as an unnatural Servitude effect. The Infernal constructs the group's Policy at the time of this Charm's activation, as follows:
         • Members of the cult loathe all things marked by the touch of the Wyld - they will attempt to drive Wyld mutants, raksha and beastmen out of the community, violently if necessary.
         • Members of the cult dress in a similar, uniform manner as defined by the Infernal. The sacred landscapes created by She Who Lives in Her Name promote conservative black-and-white outfits which cover most of the body and leave little individuality for either men or women, but Infernals may enforce any sort of appearance they desire - or even outlaw clothing altogether.
         • Members of the cult will prefer to speak a language of the Infernal's choice, and will seek to learn the favored language if they do not already know it. They will also refuse to speak any languages the Infernal forbids, or to respond to individuals who address them in forbidden tongues. She Who Lives in Her Name permits only Old Realm to be spoken in her domains, but Infernals may set the parameters of their dominions to their liking.
         • Members of the cult will proscribe certain knowledge as defined by the Infernal. They will not teach forbidden information, nor speak of it, nor tolerate its dissemination among their ranks. This could be anything from Immaculate dogma to histories of a region that differ from a certain tale the Infernal has approved to knowledge of how to grow wheat - the bans included in the group's Policy are entirely up to the warlock.
         • Members of the cult will proscribe certain sorts of action as defined by the Infernal. They will not engage in forbidden acts, nor permit individuals who do to remain within their community. This could be anything from worship of the gods (or of a particular god) to homosexual relationships to leaving the lands controlled by the cult. Again, the bans are whatever suits the Infernal's purpose.
         • Members of the cult have one obligation to the group that they must perform, defined by the Infernal. This could be anything from tithing money to a certain member of the community (or to the Infernal), to providing sexual favors to a certain class of individuals, to promoting immigration to and settlement within the land. They also compulsively reconfigure their habitations to conform to the greater symmetry of the Infernal's design.
         • Members of the cult will spend at least one hour every day attempting to puzzle out the secrets of the land's sacred geometry. The Infernal exists as a persistent blind spot in their awareness - they will not seek to interact with the warlock unless she first interacts with them, and will not turn on her if they observe her acting in violation of the cult's Policy.
         Affected individuals may spend one Willpower to act against the group's Policy for a scene. Only breaking the Intimacy will permanently free a character from the Servitude effect.
         Once the majority of the inhabitants of the region within a mile of the sacred landscape have gained an Intimacy of loyalty toward its cult, the range of the symmetrical landscape expands by a radius of one mile, and its mental influence spreads out to target all mortals within a mile of the new borders, at which point the cycle begins to repeat itself. This expansion causes the newly assimilated land to reconfigure itself to fit the symmetrical pattern of the sacred land. If the land's expanding border pushes into a region tainted by the Wyld, the tides of chaos recede. The land is no longer Sorcerous at this time and may no longer be destroyed by countermagic; only rooting out the cult and engaging in public works to destroy the Infernal's geometric patterns may return the land to normal. When the sacred land spans ten miles or more, it becomes a persistent Blasphemy.
         When the Infernal reaches Essence 3+, hints of the landscape's authorship begin to appear in all lands she has affected and all lands she subsequently reshapes. Trees show a few crystalline leaves mixed in among the normal foliage, chiming softly when the wind stirs them. Inconsequential examples of Malfean wildlife may be found within the altered land - faintly luminous, hair-thin worms float upon the air; puffs of soft white seeds fall from the clouds, sprouting crystalline flowers where they land and take root; the Things Which Lurk in Corners may occasionally be glimpsed at sunrise and sunset.

      <comment>On Chirality Prohibition Index: "Woah, mama, that's a big Charm. I came up with the idea for Chirality Prohibition Index while working on The Broken-Winged Crane, but knew I would not have time nor space to write it. So I placed it in my notes and began to add to it over time, until it turned into a rather massive tree of very interesting effects. She Who Lives in Her Name represents several distinct horror (or just plain horrific) concepts, and Chirality Prohibition Index covers several of them. Particularly: intolerance, genocide, and brainwashing. It is a hellaciously good mix of alien invasion and the Salem Witch Trials. Holden did a great job writing it, and putting up with my repeated returns to formula and reshuffling the idea until we got it right. Incidentally, this Charm is not meant to discourage users of Holy Land Infliction. That Charm's basic area needs a buffing. I'm thinking 2500 square yards, but I'll have to talk to Michael about it." -Ø</comment>

         She Who Lives in Her Name is sometimes benevolent in her schemes against gods and man. More than revenge, she savors the opportunity to prove that her enemies need her. This Charm functions identically to Essence-Lending Method (see Exalted, p. 217) save for the following changes:
         The warlock need not touch her subject. She may simply will the power into a character she can perceive up to a mile away. She may transfer up to (Essence x 5) motes in this fashion. If both she and her target have Overdrive pools, she may transfer motes from her Overdrive pool into her subject's Overdrive pool. She may also transfer Essence from her default personal or peripheral mote pools into her Overdrive pool, or the Overdrive pool of another, at a rate of three regular motes per every one offensive mote. As with Essence-Lending Method, these transfers do not contribute to anima displays. Finally, if the warlock is lending Essence to a hierarchical superior in an organization to which she belongs (such as the Whispering Flame to the Primordial King), she may Lease the Flame without spending Willpower.
      </description>
      <comment>On Lease The Flame: "Dear Defiler players: if your character's coven suddenly decides she is low lass on the totem pole, it may have to do with your recent purchase of Lease the Flame. I suggest having your character start collecting blackmail on her fellow warlocks well in advance of this purchase. Nobody can really claim to be your hierarchical superior if they're paying you to keep your mouth shut." -Ø</comment>

         In order to impose her perfection upon the world, the Whispering Flame must first teach it how to act. When the warlock learns this Charm, she gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, she may fill it by targeting a single opponent and outlawing certain actions. Valid bans include specific combat actions (such as Move, Dash, Jump, Attack, Defend Other, Aim, Cast Sorcery, or specific Miscellaneous Actions such as Draw/Ready Weapon or stanching bleeding), using Charms of a particular type (Extra Action, Simple, Supplemental and Reflexive are valid; Permanent Charms are not), or activating Charms with a particular Keyword (such as Poison, Knockback, Emotion, or Counterattack).
         The warlock signals the banned action to her target, or commands him to desist in a particular behavior, making this Charm unmistakably Obvious. Characters need not interact with the mechanical details of Exalted on the same level that players do; the warlock may relate banned actions to her opponents without being specific. "No moving!" would suffice to communicate that she has banned the Move Action, whereas, "You will cease in such petty behavior!" would allow her to communicate, in an Obvious fashion, the fact that she has banned a certain type of Charm. The outlawed action should be communicated between players using the technical language of Exalted. Players are the final arbiters of how their characters translate these details to one another.
         The Infernal gains a single offensive mote the first time during a particular target's action that they engage in the forbidden action. She may target up to her (Essence rating) different individuals with Follow the Leader, but none may share the same ban. The warlock may change the nature of an individual's ban once per action, on her action tick.
         However, the warlock must also abide by the full index of actions she has banned. If she has forbidden one individual from taking Dash actions and another from using Counterattacks, she is banned from Dashing and Counterattacking. The first time during each action that she violates a particular ban, the Infernal loses a number of offensive motes equal to the number of actions she has currently banned. Outlawed actions disappear from her index at the end of the scene. She may also lift the ban on all or some of the actions she has banned by using this Charm on her action tick.
      </description>

         The Whispering Flame knows that the power and problem of the Exalted are one and the same. Upon learning this Charm, the character gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, she may fill it by enacting the following procedure: First, she must use Essence-Dissecting Stare (or a relative effect) to witness an opponent using an Overdrive Charm. She must then analyze the Charm. If it is unknown to her, roll the warlock's Intelligence + Occult against difficulty 5. If successful, the Infernal intuits the nature of how her target's Overdrive Charm functions. She also perceives each time the analyzed Charm delivers offensive motes to her target, and may use this information to form a rough idea of how full her target's Overdrive pool is.
         Whenever an Infernal with this Charm uses Mind-Hand Manipulation to inflict at least one health level of damage to an opponent whose Overdrive she has analyzed, the Exalt automatically drains one offensive mote from her victim's Overdrive pool, adding it to her own. In addition, the warlock may reflexively modify her attack, diverting health levels of damage in step 10. For each health level of damage she withdraws from the attack, she instead siphons off three of the victim's offensive motes, adding these motes to her own Overdrive pool.
         Force-Draining Exigence and Will-Crushing Force may not be used to enhance the same attack.

      <description>She Who Lives in Her Name is as she does. In each moment she defines her might, embodying hierarchy through obedience to her mutilated king. In this, she is mighty. The Infernal gains a 10-mote Peripheral Essence pool, to which she adds one mote of Essence at the end of every hour she spends actively obeying the imperative of her Urge.</description>

         To comprehend the principle of hierarchy takes a greater understanding than is available to most. Those who taste the secret fruit may find it foul, while those who fail to comprehend a sacred truth may wind up broken. Whenever another character successfully reads the warlock's motive or intent, or discerns her Motivation or any of her Intimacies, they must make a reflexive (Intelligence + Occult) roll at a difficulty of (Infernal's Essence / 2) to comprehend the Infernal's desires and agenda. Success permits the Infernal to be safely understood, while failure renders the information incomprehensible, alien and disturbing. Moreover, failure inflicts a -1 internal penalty for the rest of the scene as the character's mind is wounded by contemplation of the unnatural universe glimpsed in the Infernal's psyche. A botch twists the information as with a failure, and also inflicts (Infernal's Essence) levels of unsoakable bashing damage as the character's mind is assaulted with impossible logic constructs other minds were not designed to comprehend. This Charm has no effect when the Infernal offers information about herself freely, only when it is gleaned against her will.
         Additionally, by paying three motes and one Willpower, the Infernal may occlude her motives, Motivation and Intimacies for one action. Characters who attempt to discern information about the warlock see nothing where these essential traits and characteristics should be. This does not cause their attempts at discernment to fail precisely, but rather gives back a sense that the Infernal does not exist or is not human, and that she possesses no Motivations or Intimacies whatsoever. Otherwise, this use of Tidings of a Bitter Season inflicts no harm.

         The Whispering Flame finds it bitterly amusing that her peers saw fit to instate free will upon existence, while their jailers have done much work to reverse this decision. Upon touching a manse containing a material intelligence (MI) and activating this Charm, the warlock's mind races through the Essence lines of the construct to penetrate the MI's Integrity and overcome it with the force of her will. Roll the character's (Wits + Presence + Essence) against a difficulty of (Manse rating); add +2 to the difficulty if the manse was constructed by a being of Essence 6+, and another +2 if the manse was built by a Lawgiver. As the Solars were well aware of the powers of She Who Lives in Her Name, this Charm is unable to overcome the defenses of manses rated N/A.
         If successful, the warlock gains possession of the material intelligence and may glean all the information it has memorized or which its owner has otherwise stored in it. The Infernal also gains access to all the manse's controls, including its security systems, monitoring abilities, and integrated weaponry, and may use these advantages as she wishes. However, so long as the Infernal is in possession of the MI, she is obligated to obey any commands its controller gives to it, so long as they are within its scope. Orders given directly to the warlock may be ignored.
         The Infernal may also possess automatons, warstriders with animating intelligences, hellstriders and other hellforged wonders, and the flickering, half-dead embers of existence which gutter in the husks of victims hollowed out by the Fair Folk, as these are also a sort of hollow mind. In the case of all but the last, use the rules for invading a manse's MI, but replace Manse with Artifact to determine difficulty. The Infernal automatically succeeds in possessing the dream-eaten. Hollow Mind Possession may never be used to control the animated dead, for the Whispering Flame makes no place for the aberrations of the Underworld in the perfect hierarchy.When the character controls a being via this Charm, she gains access to its full faculties and powers and may mentally order it to do as she wishes. She may only control one such being at a time. While doing so she suffers a -3 internal penalty to all physical actions taken by her own body.
         Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 4+ allows the Infernal to possess a valid target she can perceive by standing on the same paved road as that target, or by touching a man-made wall that the target is also touching. In this case, her psychic filter catches the current of the dragon lines moving through the construction and uses it as a vector to infect her target. A third purchase of this Charm at Essence 5+ allows a warlock standing in a demesne or manse to use this Charm on any manse within (Essence x 20) miles of her.
         After relinquishing possession, this Charm automatically leaves a backdoor which allows the warlock to possess her target remotely with no roll. This backdoor is Sorcerous and can be removed accordingly, but will not exorcise the Infernal if she is sitting in possession at the time.
         Finally, targets possessed with this Charm are always improved by the experience. The dreameaten begin to heal, developing Motivations, and Intimacies and personalities matching the possessing character, while material intelligences may become self-aware as a result of being inhabited by the warlock's illimitable mind. Occasionally She Who Lives in Her Name is able to see out through holes in her prison. Once or twice she has sent her will up the dragon lines into the material intelligences of Creation. Though she was never able to penetrate I AM's defenses, she was given to converse with that being on frequent occasions by use of a backdoor. More recently she came into possession of a material intelligence which plays a tremendous game of Gateway.

         During the First Age, the Lawgivers stacked their towers high along the dragon lines. The Whispering Flame regrets that she may never have the chance to show them how easily their petty infrastructure might be toppled. A character using Hollow Mind Possession to control the material intelligence of a manse he stands within may activate Noumena-Seizing Assimilation in order to emit a mimetic virus of will, which races through the dragon lines in every direction, striking every manse-based material intelligence within (Essence x 30) miles with a psychic attack.
         This attack is slightly weaker than the prerequisite, omitting the warlock's Essence from its attack roll, but otherwise functions as Hollow Mind Possession. This does not allow the warlock to possess all targets at once; if successful, it establishes Sorcerous backdoors which the Infernal may then possess using this Charm's prerequisite.
         While Noumena-Seizing Assimilation is not able to independently infect automatons, warstriders, and other material intelligences not grounded directly into the dragon lines, if any such constructs happen to be plugged into manses, hard-docked or otherwise directly connected to a manse when it is attacked, or otherwise junctioned directly into the dragon lines, they also suffer this attack and may have a backdoor Sorcerously appended by which the Infernal may arrest control of them.
         This Charm may never be used across realms of existence.

         Free will is a work of the imagination, no more valuable to the Whispering Flame than the princes of make-believe who dance in gossamer halls, and equally worthy of eradication. A warlock must be inside a manse and in possession of its material intelligence to use this Charm. The Infernal transmits a psychic pulse for (Essence x 100) yards around the manse. Roll the character's Willpower + Essence and compare it to the Dodge MDV of all mortals within the area of the pulse.
         Those affected by Mind Spider Curse have their free will stripped immediately and painlessly. They stand frozen, staring vacantly out at a world they no longer recognize, their minds blanked and waiting for the Infernal's commands. Victims will not respond to anyone or anything if the Infernal does not permit it. Not even a lover's heartbroken pleas will reach the ears of one who has been broken by Mind Spider Curse. The effects of Mind Spider Curse may be resisted for one month by paying five Willpower. This price may not be paid after the victim has succumbed to the curse.
         Targets aged 12 or younger are particularly susceptible to Mind Spider Curse, as their minds have not yet fully formed. Such targets are at -2 Dodge MDV to resist this Charm. She Who Lives in Her Name is aware of this fact, and is certain the intransigent Chosen will sue for peace if she takes their children away.
         Those who resist Mind Spider Curse experience a moment of agony in which they feel insectile fingers rooting through their psyche. This soon passes, and may be followed by watery eyes or a nosebleed, but no penalties are incurred. Should they resist, targets intuitively know the direction from which the psychic attack originated and will associate it with the manse used to amplify the Charm.
         Mind Spider Curse has no effect on Exalts, raksha or spirits; rather, it specifically targets the ants from which the Exalted emerge. The Whispering Flame knows that by cauterizing those traits which make humans special, she will prevent the emergence of future Chosen.

         She Who Lives in Her Name need not manifest in order to make her will known. A character who invokes this Charm is able to communicate over long distances with all characters to whom she is superior within a hierarchical organization. Victims broken by Will-Crushing Force, infected by Mind Spider Curse or affected by Unshattered Tongue Perfection are always considered valid targets for this Charm, regardless of the warlock's hierarchical position.
         Characters subject to this communication hear a voice like dozens of crystal chimes which conveys the wishes of a supreme and alien intellect. The Infernal may selectively address as many or as few valid targets as she wishes. Only valid targets of Disembodied Voice Tintinnabula actually hear the warlock's words. If the character attempts to address a target in another realm of existence, this Charm gains the Blasphemy keyword. This Blasphemy is centered on the Infernal if she is in Creation. Otherwise it is centered on everyone to whom she is speaking.
         Targets treat social attacks made by the voice as unnatural mental influence costing two Willpower to resist. They do not instinctively know the source of this speech, or to whom the voice belongs. Those familiar with the Infernal must make a (Wits + Socialize) roll at a difficulty of the warlock's Essence in order to recognize her behind the tinkling, chiming voice they are hearing.

         The sound of the Whispering Flame's voice is as beautiful as it is alien. A character who learns this Charm permanently splits her voice into many elegant fragments. Whenever she speaks, she is heard not as one voice but as several cool, modular voices tinged by the sound of a thousand tiny crystals pouring through a sieve.
         A character with this Charm may spend one Willpower to split her dialogue between two characters for one scene. She does not seem to speak in two voices at once; rather each target hears a customized dialogue, allowing the warlock to deny certain members of an audience the chance to hear her arguments. Characters who are not specifically targeted by the Infernal hear a pleasant humming of diamond sighs and glass whispers rather than what she is actually saying. Furthermore, the Infernal may pay up to (Essence) Willpower to split her arguments amongst (Essence) targets, making customized social attacks against multiple individuals, further reducing their power to aid one another in contradicting her.
         In essence, the Infernal may roll Performance-based social attacks and ascribe different meaning to these attacks for different listening characters, while filtering other listeners out entirely. Listeners may spend one Willpower to take a miscellaneous action to try to unthread the Exalt's words, enabling them to hear all she says, by rolling Perception + Socialize against a difficulty of the warlock's Essence, with an external penalty equal to the number of Willpower she has paid into this Charm for the scene. Failure subjects listeners to an incomprehensible jumble of all the Infernal's words at once.
         This Charm allows the warlock to choose (Essence) target languages when activating Interlocution Metamorphosis Prophecy at no extra cost. A repurchase of this Charm at Essence 5+ allows her to subsume up to (Essence x 2) languages when activating this Charm's prerequisite. A final repurchase at Essence 7+ allows her to be understood in any language, but increases the activation cost of Interlocution Metamorphosis Prophecy to 10 motes, one Willpower.

         She Who Lives in Her Name may simulcast her will to the broken-tongued traitors who stole Creation. A character may activate this Charm while in possession of the material intelligence of a manse, though she need not be inside the manse. The warlock opens an Essence channel in all constructs bearing a backdoor created by Hollow Mind Possession or Noumena-Seizing Assimilation, through which she may broadcast her voice clearly enough to be heard for (Essence x 100) yards. The character may choose to broadcast from as many or as few valid targets as she wishes, and may broadcast or omit dialogue as she chooses while this Charm is active. Furthermore, the Infernal has the option of disguising her voice with the same chiming, tinkling suspire of crystals created by Disembodied Voice Tintinnabula at no extra cost.
         A warlock need not broadcast her voice to make her presence known. While the channel is open, the Infernal may choose to activate Mind Spider Curse for 10 motes, one Willpower, unleashing it from all manses she is currently broadcasting from simultaneously. Even though the Charm is Essence 5, this use of Mind Spider Curse is an Essence 7 Blasphemy effect which immediately reveals the location of all manses from which the attack was unleashed. Broadcast Announcement Prana may not be used from other realms of existence.
         When using Heuristic Logos Shintai, the Infernal may activate Broadcast Announcement Prana for zero motes, allowing her to broadcast her voice through her transformed self. She may also personally inflict Mind Spider Curse on her victims without the use of a manse, using her Shintai as the vector to unleash the mimetic virus of will. Both of the aforementioned Charms as well as Space Monster Scream and World-Whale Keening have their ranges increased to (Essence x 300) yards while under the effects of Heuristic Logos Shintai.

         Once, the Whispering Flame placed her ear against the conceptual Without of Oramus and heard a terrifying scream. In her secret heart it excited her, and she remembered every detail: tone, pitch, and length. Through practice she tuned her perfectly fragmented voice to produce this one sound: a Primordial scream which may rend the traitor gods asunder.
         An Infernal who unleashes this Charm pierces the conceptual fabric of existence to visit the landscape with the very essence of horror made sound, shredding through spirits, torturing Fair Folk and shattering mortal souls. As the warlock searches for the perfect tone to create this monstrosity, she makes an undodgeable attack which cannot be blocked without the aid of magic, rolling (Intelligence + Performance) and adding (Essence) automatic successes. Space Monster Scream targets all beings within (Essence x 100) yards of the Infernal, but may be heard up to (Essence) miles with no consequence. Its base damage is (Intelligence + Occult + Essence)L. This damage is aggravated against gods, raksha, and the sheridans of Adorjan. Targets incapacitated by Space Monster Scream without a Shaping defense active immediately lose their dying health levels and are shaped into solid crystal statues frozen in the agony of their final death throes.
         Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 6+ allows an Infernal using Broadcast Announcement Prana to unleash Space Monster Scream from all manses she is broadcasting from for an activation cost of 20 motes, two willpower, and one aggravated health level. She may not do so again until her DV has refreshed 10 times.

      <description>Caught in the wake of the Primordial scream, the Whispering Flame heard its refrain: an echo of misery from a wound deep within the world. She trapped this harmony in her crystalline spheres. Now it echoes in her mind, waiting for release. Invoking this Charm unleashes a mournful, sonic lowing which detonates the crystallized victims of Space Monster Scream, showering the area with deadly shrapnel. World-Whale Keening has a range of (Essence x 100 yards) from the warlock, or from any place from which her voice is being broadcast using Broadcast Announcement Prana. This keening lamentation rips through the battlefield, setting off explosions twenty yards in diameter, doing one-time environmental damage (Damage 6L, Trauma 3) to all targets riddled by the fragments of shattered crystal.</description>

         Each syllable of the name in which the Principle of Hierarchy dwells encodes the birth or unraveling of the universe, a weapon of sublime perfection. By superimposing a syllable of that word over the pattern of her body, an Infernal with this Charm unravels herself into perfect crystal geometries of force and motion resembling the Pyrian Source in miniature. She may embrace this form or choose another, rebuilding her component constellations into any imagined shape that fits within a (Essence x 100) yard radius - most commonly herself surrounded by a storm of spheres. Ultimately, all permutations provide the following:
         • Myriad crystal orbs and semi-tangible light constructs comprise her reimagined body, leaving her without means of parrying, physically manipulating her environment, or physically attacking by most means. She can dodge normally. Her natural soak and hardness increases to 10L/B (if lower) and she can't suffer more than minimum damage from each attack or other injurious event (this cap is applied to levels suffered in step 10).
         • Her constellations levitate and fly as though using Ascendant Objectivity Stance.
         • She can use Principle-Invoking Onslaught as an innate power rather than a Charm activation, paying nothing to do so. She has no limit on the number of independent clinches she can maintain.
         • Her effective Strength with Mind-Hand Manipulation triples, the range of her telekinesis increases to (Essence x 300) yards and the rate of telekinetic striking attacks rises to 10. She can choose for telekinetic attacks to encompass an entire complementary unit in mass combat, systematically sweeping through the ranks with cold efficiency. This doubles the raw damage of the attack and ensures that all casualties lost to it can be killed, permitted to desert or maimed as the Infernal dictates.
         • She isn't required to inflict damage to substitute Willpower drain for damage via Will-Crushing Force. Instead, she can make this swap any time she hits. Further, she can attack complementary units this way, in which case Willpower drain applies separately to all members and is simultaneously tracked as an aggregate total against the unit. Once the total reaches the highest Willpower rating for all mortal members, these characters dissolve in white flame and are replaced with soulless copies. If the majority of the unit is converted, it ejects unconverted members and must reorganize its ranks accordingly.

         <errText>Heuristic Logos Shintai does not reduce damage in Step 10; instead, the Infernal's crystalline form adds +20B/20L soak. She does not need to eat, drink, or breathe while in this form.</errText>
