        <description>Touched by the endless hunger of Oblivion, Abyssal Exalted can learn to extend their animas through their mastery of a particular Ability, drinking Essence from the suffering they inflict. Whenever the deathknight takes an action or activates a Charm using the chosen Ability, he regains one mote for every level of damage the action or Charm inflicts to sentient beings as if he had bitten the victims directly. If multiple Ravening Mouth of (Ability) Charms could apply in a situation, the Abyssal may use only one. Indirect damage to that target also awards motes, such as health levels paid as part of the costs of defensive Charms. Ravening Mouth Charms exist for Archery, Martial Arts, Melee and Thrown. Abyssals cannot use this Charm to feed through the effects of spells.
   Note that ongoing damage after the initial action or Charm (such as from poison) do not award further motes. In addition, the Abyssal can never gain more than 20 motes during a single one of her actions from any combination of Charms including Ravening Mouth of (Ability).</description>

            <errText>Any motes granted by this Charm are attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Abyssal's Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Abyssal may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</errText>

        <description>When the arrows of Oblivion taste blood can they be blamed for drinking deeper of the wound? This Charm enhances any Archery-based attack that inflicts lethal (or aggravated) damage. If the attack inflicts any damage to an animate being, the projectile burrows deeper into the wound and cannot be removed without a difficulty 3 (Strength + [Athletics or Medicine]) roll as a miscellaneous action. Energy-based attacks instead cover the target in an agonizing nimbus of the appropriate energy (so firewands set victims aflame), but the action to extinguish this nimbus is the same. Until the effect is stopped, the victim suffers an number of dice of lethal damage equal to the Abyssal's Essence on each tick when the victim acts (or once every five seconds out of combat). This damage bypasses soak and Hardness from armor.Victims suffering from multiple activations of this Charm use the highest Essence among the archers to determine damage, adding one die to the damage and one to the difficulty of removal for each activation after the first.</description>

        <description>Nothing can save those whom an Abyssal archer has chosen for death. As the arrow leaves her bow, a shrieking spectral aura guides her shaft inexorably to its target. As with the Solar Charm, the player rolls the attack but only to see if there are sufficient successes to add to damage.</description>

        <description>This Charm transforms the archer's projectile into a ripple of moaning, ghostly Essence with no substance outside the dreams of the Neverborn. This pulse passes through all corporeal and incorporeal objects without effect except for the attack's designated target(s). If it hits its mark, the attack shifts back to full reality to inflict its usual injury. If it misses, it ceases to exist. Mechanically, this effect negates all penalties from cover, bypasses all soak except innate soak, and makes the attack unblockable except to unarmed parries.</description>

        <description>When an Abyssal archer draws his weapon, panic ensues. Death is coming, its cold fist tight on the hearts of those who might be prey. Activating this Charm instantly draws and loads an Archery weapon the deathknight has available, either on his person or banished Elsewhere via Banished Bow Arsenal (see p. 124). More importantly, if this Charm is used during a Join Battle action, all other combatants who beat the Abyssal's player's roll feel overwhelming dread at the thought of initiating hostilities against the suddenly armed deathknight. As a result, they suffer an internal penalty equal to the Abyssal's Archery rating on all attacks directed against the deathknight until he takes his first action. Any attacker willing to reflexively spend three Willpower can end the Charm's unnatural mental influence over her (gaining Limit or Resonance if appropriate), allowing her to attack the Abyssal without penalty.</description>

        <description>Some Abyssals find ranged weapons distasteful because they do not afford an opportunity to stare into a victim's eyes as she dies. Unfortunately, archers who fire weapons close enough to savor each kill lose the primary advantage of using ranged weapons in the first place. This Charm reconciles the paradox of sadism and practicality, invoking the proximate certainty of Oblivion to aid point-blank shots. Upon activating Elegant Executioner Stance, the Abyssal may draw and load any Archery weapons available to him as part of the action needed to use this Charm. For the rest of the Charm's duration, whenever the Abyssal makes an Archery based attack on a target within five yards, extra successes on attack rolls count twice for purposes of determining raw damage.</description>

        <description>The deathknight imbues a ranged attack with the Essence of Oblivion, making every arrow a talon of the Neverborn and every firewand blast a shrieking exhalation of Primordial doom. This Charm adds the Abyssal's Essence to the raw damage of an Archery-based attack. Learning the Charm also gives the Abyssal one of the following effects. Additional effects cost one experience point for each or one bonus point for two. Abyssals may apply as many known effects to each attack as desired, but each costs two motes to use.
    Bloodthirsty Arrow: The necrotic Essence infusing the arrow brings certain death. The archer adds two dice to post-soak damage or reduces the target's DV against the attack by one, as he chooses. The character can stack these effects by spending additional motes, but cannot increase damage or reduce the target's DV by an amount greater than his permanent Essence.
   Dream-Shattering Spite: The attack unravels the illusions of life and hope. It inflicts aggravated damage to creatures of the Wyld. The attack inflicts normal damage to all other targets.
   Hundred Paces Bite: Imbued with necrotic power, the attack disrupts and devours Essence. If the attack hits a being with an Essence pool (regardless of whether it inflicts any damage), the victim loses a number of motes equal to the Abyssal's Essence rating. Beings with Personal Essence lose motes from this pool first. Abyssals who know Ravening Mouth of Archery absorb the drained motes. Otherwise, the energy simply fades into Oblivion.
   Imposition of Agony: The Neverborn suffer without the release of death. An attack blessed with this effect carries a brief taste of this cold torture. If the attack hits an animate target (regardless of whether it inflicts any damage), the victim convulses and falls prone from psychic shock, unless her player successfully rolls to resist knockdown (Exalted, p. 153). If the Abyssal chooses, this effect can also remove all physical damage from the attack, transforming the projectile into a writhing corona of red and black lightning on impact.</description>

        <description>The Deathknight's arrows carry the chill of the Void. Not only does this Charm add the Abyssal's Essence rating to her attack's raw damage, her target loses one dot of Dexterity if the attack inflicts any damage. Creatures reduced to zero Dexterity can only huddle in helpless misery. Lost Dexterity returns at a rate of one dot per minute. Iron Sleet Attack does not affect automata, the living dead, ghosts and other creatures immune to extreme cold.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal lopes and scuttles along surfaces in violation of natural law. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm does allow the Exalt to stop while inverted or standing on a vertical surface, but the Charm automatically deactivates whenever he moves normally along a horizontal surface. Abyssals with Essence 4+ may reflexively pay one mote per action to move along a horizontal surface without terminating the Charm.</description>

        <description>Lesser Abyssals might steady themselves with essence for a time, only to fall flat on their faces at a key moment in combat when they cannot afford to waste a Charm activation on the effect. With this Charm, however, activating Raiton's Nimble Perch no longer counts as Charm use. More importantly, whenever the Abyssal has Raiton's Nimble Perch active, she can spend one mote to negate all damage from falling and automatically succeeds on any attempt to arrest a fall by grabbing onto something (unless there is absolutely nothing available to grab).</description>

        <description>This Charm greatly enhances an Abyssal's ability to hurl large objects to destructive effect (Exalted, p. 127):
• Add +5 to the character's (Strength + Athletics) total for the purposes of determining what he can throw as a weapon.
• Multiply the attack's base Range by 10.
• Increase the attack's Accuracy to +3 instead of -3.
   If such an attack hits a character who is no larger than the size of the projectile, the target automatically falls prone beneath the object. She must lift the object off her with a feat of strength as a miscellaneous action or use some other means to free herself before she can rise from prone or move from the spot to which she was pinned. (As a dubious compensation, she receives full cover until she escapes).
   Despite being an Athletics Charm because of its feat-of-strength focus, Headstones Flung Like Pebbles may supplement only Thrown attacks using appropriate improvised projectiles.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal throws himself into the dark space between and outside the strands of fate, daring a shortcut that physically traverses the normally abstract and intangible nightmares of the Neverborn. Upon activating this Charm, the deathknight leaps and vanishes into a vortex of darkness. For five minutes, he exists only as a remembrance in the Whispers of the Neverborn and risks true annihilation if the Neverborn should cease to dream. Lost in total sensory deprivation, he experiences the journey as a Storyteller-controlled Whispers vision showing him something he would rather not have seen. When the harrowing detour ends, the Abyssal reappears at any desired destination that he has previously observed that is within (Essence x 5) miles of where he started.
   This Charm will not teleport the Abyssal into a solid object, but rather spits him out at the closest permitted point to his intended destination. Activating this Charm during the day does nothing but waste Essence.</description>

        <description>The Neverborn gaze into Creation even in their sleep, compounding their hatred of all that was stolen from them. While this Charm is active, the Exalt's eyes glow with unholy power. He may view any location within (Essence) miles by looking directly at it, seeing that place as clearly as if he stood there, bypassing intervening objects. Only areas warded from scrying remain impenetrably darkened to his sight.
   Anyone upon whom the Abyssal spies using this Charm gains a vague feeling of being watched by something malevolent if her player makes a reflexive (Perception + Occult) roll at difficulty 5. Only those with appropriate forms of Essence-based perception, however, can actually recognize and understand the Charm at work.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's pupils ooze outward to stain iris and white alike with featureless and pitiless darkness. Enemies who stare into this darkness sometimes see their own death reflected within, the death they fear or perhaps the death the Neverborn wish for them (though such visions carry no true prophetic power). More practically, the deathknight can see perfectly in the dark without any penalties or reduction in visibility. He is no better able to see through fog or other visual obstructions.
   The Taint drawback to this Charm is that the Abyssal's eyes become painfully sensitive to direct sunlight within Creation, imposing a -1 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions while so illuminated unless he closes his eyes completely. His eyes also immediately betray his supernatural nature if he cannot somehow hide their stain. The Taint costs one bonus point or two experience points.</description>

        <description>Having died once, few Abyssals want to make another attempt. Knowledge of this Charm expands an Abyssal's contact with the Whispers of the Neverborn, filling her mind with a gloating hiss whenever she faces immediate mortal peril. This momentary warning identifies the threat and suffices to warn her of an incoming unexpected attack, to avoid sipping from a poisoned goblet or to otherwise circumvent death by taking a single critical action. She must have some remote possibility of detecting the threat on her own or she fails to understand the warning in time for it to help her. Moreover, this Charm does not function while the Abyssal has more points of accumulated Resonance than (10 - Essence rating).</description>

        <description>Nothing stimulates productivity like pervasive mortal terror. To use this Charm, the Abyssal executes a subordinate member of a Magnitude 3+ organization she leads. Her player rolls (Manipulation + Bureaucracy + Essence) at a difficulty equal to the organization's Magnitude. Killing a high-ranking or popular subordinate or performing the execution in a particularly brutal or innovative manner can provide stunt dice.
   Success increases the speed of all projects the organization undertakes by a factor equal to the Abyssal's Bureaucracy rating for a number of days equal to the threshold successes rolled (minimum one day). It also counts as a scene of building an Intimacy of fear toward the deathknight for all members. Failure decreases the Magnitude of the organization by one from demoralized desertions.
       Repeated use of this Charm weakens the emotional impact of the execution, imposing a cumulative -1 internal penalty to subsequent activations targeting the same organization. Each month that goes by without use of this Charm removes one die of this penalty.</description>

        <description>As the heralds of Oblivion and the Chosen weapons of the Neverborn, Abyssal Exalted may command lesser horrors and expect obedience. Accursed Overlord Authority enables the Exalt to make social attacks upon unintelligent creatures of Death such as walking dead and hungry ghosts. The creatures respond as if they had Intelligence 1 and shared a common language with the Abyssal. This capacity to follow directives of greater complexity does not actually increase their Intelligence outside of the exact wording of ordered behavior or give them greater facility to understand language in other contexts. Even without commands, such monsters will not attack the deathknight unless another magical being directly commands them to do so.</description>

This Charm targets any organization containing a member with whom the Abyssal has spent at least one scene interacting in the past month, provided the unit's Magnitude does not exceed the Abyssal's (Bureaucracy x 2).</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's words eat away at organizations like acid permanently damaging their functionality. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm uses Manipulation in place of Charisma or Intelligence for all rolls and limits. It also has lower trait minimums and activation costs: Social destruction comes easily to Abyssals.</description>

        <description>Empires fall when the Abyssal wills it so, and they die by suicide. Through a week of interaction with selected members of an organization, the Abyssal curses that social group to sloth, corruption and ineptitude. The Abyssal's player rolls (Wits + Bureaucracy) at a difficulty equal to its leader's Dodge MDV plus half of the group's Magnitude.
   If the roll succeeds, the time the organization takes to complete any project increases every week thereafter. It doubles on the first week, triples on the second, and so on. At the same time, every project of the organization whose success could be represented through a dice roll suffers an internal penalty that increases by one per week (-1, -2, -3, etc.). The time multiplier and internal penalty increase until they match the Bureaucracy rating the Abyssal had when she laid the curse. At that point, the time required to complete even the simplest task - one that people in the organization would normally finish in minutes - increases to a number of hours equal to the Abyssal's Bureaucracy rating. A military unit cursed by this Charm loses Drill instead of taking an internal penalty, to a minimum Drill of 0.
   The level of corruption instilled by this Charm is brazenly obvious to everyone who interacts with the afflicted organization. How individuals and other organizations respond to this vice depends on their personality or policy as normal, though a backlash of some kind is almost inevitable.
   The organization's leader can force the organization to work faster on one specific project by spending Loyalty: one point to counter one increment of time delay and internal penalty. Only after spending a number of Loyalty points equal to the Abyssal's (Wits + Bureaucracy + Essence) and the organization's Magnitude can the leader restore the organization to its previous efficiency... whatever that was. Fortunately, effects of Regime-Toppling Lord of Misrule do not stack.</description>

        <description>Fear of darkness empowers it. All characters with an intimacy of fear toward the Abyssal cannot knowingly take any actions that would harm the deathknight or lessen their fear of him unless they pay one Willpower point to overcome this Charm's unnatural mental influence for a scene. This Compulsion also forces characters to resist social attacks with their best mental defenses if those attacks would make them take prohibited actions. Even if wretches who live in fear of the Abyssal dare to face their terror, prohibited actions still suffer an internal penalty equal to the deathknight's Essence rating.</description>

        <description>It is the ordained function of all Abyssal Exalted to kill the world one piece at a time. The character need only touch a non-magical, inanimate object and this Charm marks it for destruction. Items on an individual's person benefit from their bearer's defenses to avoid this attack. It can affect objects as large as a suit of armor or a sledge.
   Upon contact, cracks rapidly spread across the target, through which the unholy glow of entropic Essence spills out in bright beams. In seconds, nothing remains but a fine residue of acrid dust and a few wisps of foul smoke.</description>

        <description>the Abyssal's eyes flash with incandescent malice, unmaking whatever offends his sight. This Charm enhances its prerequisite, allowing the Abyssal to "touch" any valid target within (Essence x 100) yards with a (Perception + Craft) roll for the attack. The Abyssal must use the Craft Ability that best corresponds to the creation or composition of the object. Items on an in-dividual's person benefit from their bearer's defenses to avoid this attack.
   In addition, the Abyssal can change the duration of his All-Consuming Entropy Attack to Indefinite by committing the Essence he spends on the attack. He delays the Charm's effects until he withdraws the commitment. Upon reflexively ending the Charm, the deathknight may either destroy the object or spare it.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal feels entropy's presence within inanimate objects. This Charm enhances one attack and is explicitly permitted to supplement actions using other Abilities. The attack ignores the soak of non-magical objects or makes the attack piercing against a magical target (though this avails nothing against most artifacts, which are nearly indestructible and lack a listed soak rating). If the attack already inflicts piercing damage, halve the already-reduced soak instead. When the deathknight uses this Charm to supplement an attack against an attack that already inflicts piercing damage, the foe's armor provides only one quarter of its listed soak bonus.</description>

        <description>Although entropy is inevitable it is also sometimes inconvenient. An Abyssal with this Charm infuses an inanimate object or necromantic creation with the unnatural stasis of the Underworld. Targets of this Charm become immune to non-magical sources of corrosion, rust, rot, weathering and any other manifestation of entropy (as decided by the Storyteller). The target also gains a Hardness equal to its soak against magical sources of entropy, such as pyre flame or the destructive energies unleashed by various Abyssal Charms. This enchantment is permanent for inanimate objects. For walking dead and necromantically animated war machines, the effects last five maintenance cycles. (See the discussion of necrotech maintenance on pp. 205-207). If the necrotech creation stays inactive, it multiplies the time between maintenance by 10. The Charm cannot affect the living.</description>

        <description>Spurred by mad genius and inspired by the desolation of the Underworld, Abyssal artisans construct and repair weapons almost as fast as they imagine them. This Charm enhances a Craft action, which can be an extended or dramatic action. Until the Exalt completes the project or ends the Charm by taking another action, he may accomplish (Essence x 5) hours worth of work to build or repair a destructive item per hour. He also works without the need for tools as if he had access to a basic workshop (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. III Oadenol's Codex, p. 28). When repairing items, broken pieces may be joined together seamlessly as if the object were new again.
   For the purposes of this Charm, a destructive item is defined as anything with a function that is overtly harmful, with weapons as an obvious example. Strictly utilitarian items do not qualify, let alone anything actually intended to help others outside of making them more effective killers (for instance, armor made for an army bent on massacre). The Storyteller remains final arbiter of what qualifies as a destructive item but should be strict in judgment. The Abyssal Exalted exist to destroy the world, not add to its wonders.</description>

        <description>Of all the myriad horrors an Abyssal can impose on a ghost, dooming it to an eternity of impotent agony within soulsteel is easily the worst. The deathknight touches a ghostly victim and commits three motes to poison its corpus with the Essence of the Neverborn until the smelting into soulsteel is complete. Next, the Abyssal or a designated subordinate spends a dramatic action brutally beating the ghost into malleable hopelessness, taking a number of minutes equal to the ghost's (Willpower + Essence). The Charm ends and must be reactivated if interrupted for any reason, so the victim must be restrained to prevent it from initiating combat or escaping. Once the ghost breaks down, the Abyssal strikes a final clanging blow heard for a mile, hammering the victim's corpus into a whimpering mass of raw soulsteel. Obviously, ghosts must be material with respect to the Abyssal through-out their forging, effectively limiting this Charm's use to the Underworld or a shadowland at night. Note that soulsteel artifacts need one soul for every 10 accumulated successes required for their design (rounded up).
   Abyssals with Essence 5+ may use this Charm within the Underworld to forge captive gods with Essence 3 or less into starmetal, but they cannot use subordinates, and the initial torture takes a number of hours equal to the god's (Willpower + Essence). The wasteful inefficiency of this process means that the same number of gods must be forged to make a starmetal artifact as the ghosts needed for soulsteel devices. Deathlords primarily use this starmetal as bribes for the Five-Score Fellowship (not accepted as often as they'd like), though they keep some for their own depraved use.</description>

        <description>Inspired by the alien and genocidal genius of the Neverborn, the most depraved Abyssal engineers invent weapons that would take lesser Exalted centuries to conceive. Once a deathknight purchases this Charm, the Craft, Lore, Medicine and Occult minimums required to design, build and repair destructive artifacts decrease by one (to a minimum of 1). The Exalt receives the same benefits toward creating Abyssal manses. For the purposes of this Charm, a destructive artifact must meet the same criteria as a destructive item defined by Frenzied Forge Within. An Abyssal may buy this Charm no more than twice.</description>

He reappears all too quickly, his perfect dodge completed by reforming him somewhere within (Essence) yards that he could have reached through conventional evasive action. This Charm can dodge undodgeable attacks, but it cannot dodge unexpected attacks. This Charm carries one of the Four Flaws of Abyssal Invulnerability.</description>

        <description>When faced with an unexpected attack an Abyssal who knows this Charm can let her supernatural instincts to take over. She moves before she knows why she moves, forestalling the immediacy of her ruin with the inevitability of suffering to come. Tapping into these instincts adds a point of Resonance to the deathknight's total but allows her to defend normally with her Dodge DV or (in a Combo) other Dodge-based defenses.</description>

            <errText>Uncanny Impulse Evasion costs zero motes against ghosts, mortals, and raksha. However, the Abyssal gains one point of Resonance the first time in a scene that he activates it to defend against an unexpected attack made by a servant of Oblivion - including spectres, nephwracks, hekatonkires, Deathlords, and his fellow Abyssal Exalted.
   Abyssals who know the Charm Flickering Wisp Technique may pay two experience points to permanently upgrade its capabilities so that it and Flitting Shadow Form are considered to be the same Charm for the purpose of Charm activations and Combos.</errText>

        <description>The Abyssal toys with an enemy by sidestepping her attack at the last moment, forcing her to embarrassingly overreach. This Charm offers a special unblockable "counterattack" to Melee or Martial Arts-based attacks using a pool of the death-knight's (Dexterity + Dodge + Essence). If this "attack" hits, the opponent takes no damage but is automatically stunned or prone (Abyssal's choice) without a roll. (See Exalted, p. 153 for the effects of being stunned or prone).
   Foe-Shaming Defense is even more effective in response to attacks within a flurry, as a successful counterattack makes all subsequent attacks in the flurry automatically fail to hit the Abyssal.</description>

        <description>The hatred of an Abyssal is more relentless even than the deathknight who carries it. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm reinforces an Intimacy of hatred toward an organization, an idea or a widespread social group. Any mental influence that works against the Abyssal's desire to extinguish the target of his hatred becomes an unacceptable order. As an additional side effect, whenever an Abyssal with this Charm dies, her next incarnation gains the Intimacy along with Exaltation, though this hatred is no longer magically empowered.</description>

        <description>Unlike the cowardly Yozis the Primordials who became the Neverborn chose death before submission. Emulating such nihilistic heroism, an Abyssal with this Charm may pay levels of lethal damage as if they were Willpower to resist mental influence or Virtue compulsions. For effects requiring more than one Willpower point to resist, the Abyssal may mix-and-match between health levels and actual Willpower when paying the cost. The deathknight gains no Resonance for resisting unnatural mental influence solely with health rather than actual Willpower. Damage from this Charm can manifest as proud and obvious wounds or the ravages of disease, but the injuries take the form of imperceptible weakness by default.</description>

        <description>The world is filled with those who think themselves fearsome and awe-inspiring, but they are as posturing children before the ultimate darkness of Oblivion. Deathknights can use this Charm in response to any mental influence, perfectly negating the attempt as the Abyssal's anima momentarily flashes with power.
   This Charm has a more vicious effect when defending against direct unnatural mental influence from a character who is solely targeting and currently interacting with the Abyssal (rather than doing so indirectly through a written text, delayed-effect Social Charm, etc).. In such cases, the thread of Essence connecting the attacker to the Abyssal's psyche also momentarily touches the sleeping minds of the Neverborn through the conduit of the deathknight's Whispers. The attacker suffers a Resonance eruption with Resonance points equal to half the deathknight's Essence rating (rounded down). The points allocated to particular Resonance effects are limited by the attacker's Essence rating as normal.
   Note that this backlash is not an optional part of the Charm, even if the Abyssal would rather defend in a more subtle fashion. Perfect mental defenses can disconnect the attacker's Essence from the Abyssal's mind in time to avoid a Resonance backlash.</description>

        <description>Abyssal exalted belong to the Neverborn. However hard they struggle against the chains of their enslavement, Dark Fate always drags them back down into damnation and horror. Therefore, lesser slavery cannot hold them. The Abyssal may reflexively pay one level of unsoakable aggravated damage and lose all remaining Willpower points from sudden incontrovertible certainty of her doom. This certainty shatters all long-term Compulsion, Illusion and Servitude effects on her. The Exalt can ignore mental influence that would prevent her from using this Charm to free herself. A character can use this Charm at any time, but an occasion when she uses Whispers would be dramatically appropriate.</description>

        <description>The Neverborn do not reward their thralls for a job well done. The closest they come is to hate favored slaves a little less. Whenever the Abyssal would regain one or more Willpower points from sleep, he may forfeit that Willpower to reduce his Resonance total by one point. He may also forgo all other awards for a three-die stunt that directly furthers the cause of Oblivion in order to reduce Resonance by one point. Eclipse Castes cannot learn this Charm, since they do not have Resonance to make it meaningful.</description>

        <description>All Abyssals serve the Neverborn whether they intend to or not, but some embrace their destiny as world-killing weapons with a fervor that unnerves even the Deathlords. This Charm may be learned by only those deathknights who journey to the temple-tombs of their undead masters and prostrate themselves without interrupting their vigil for the time necessary to learn the Charm with a teacher. At the conclusion of this training period, the Neverborn judge the deathknight's heart. If any positive Intimacies remain, the Exalt suffers a 10-Resonance eruption and finds herself violently expelled from the unhallowed caverns in rebuke for troubling her sleeping masters.
   Abyssals who come with truly desolate hearts watch as a new Monstrance of Celestial Portion grows out of her own flesh and forges a link to her Exaltation. Meanwhile, her old Monstrance implodes with a thunderclap, informing her liege that the death-knight no longer requires an intermediary to command her. The Deathlords dare not gainsay the revealed will of their masters, but the Exalt does lose the substantial benefits of any Liege dots she possessed. In exchange, she exists entirely outside Fate as a direct agent of the Neverborn and gains limited immortality.
   Unless slain with an attack that can permanently destroy spirits, any lesser demise does not actually kill her. Instead, her body dissolves into tarry smoke that hisses one final retort. Following these parting comments, her Exaltation instantly returns to its Monstrance in the temple-tomb, leaving all possessions behind at the site of her death. Her body requires a day to regenerate within its cage, after which she awakens screaming in agony and with one less dot of Essence. The character temporarily loses access to all Charms whose minimum Essence exceeds her new rating until she spends the experience to regain her former Essence rating. (Immortal Malevolence Enslavement is an explicit exception to this rule). Abyssals reduced to Essence 0 by this Charm fall into Oblivion.
   In case it isn't obvious, this Charm disqualifies an Abyssal from ever redeeming herself and becoming a Solar again. From this decision, there is no return.</description>

        <description>Within every Abyssal lies a dim and flickering hope, a shining spark of Solar glory that no necromancy or unholy darkness can entirely suppress. Tapping into this legacy, a deathknight with this Charm may learn Solar Charms as if she were a member of the Moonshadow Caste. In addition, she may accept a point of Resonance to activate a Solar Mirror of a known Abyssal Charm as if she knew the Mirror. It is not possible to use an Abyssal Charm while its Mirror remains active or vice versa, nor may an Abyssal copy a Mirror if either Charm is permanent. As a final side effect, deathknights who know this Charm automatically pass into Lethe upon their demise rather than Oblivion.
   It is not yet known if a Solar analogue is possible that enables a Lawgiver to learn Abyssal Charms and delivers her to Oblivion upon death.</description>

        <description>This Charm works like its Solar counterpart, except that rather than acting as a god-king, the Abyssal must play out her part as a world-killing weapon. Stunts are upgraded only when the Abyssal seeks to slay either the living or the dead, inflict needless cruelty upon another (mentally, emotionally or physically), inspire fear, or ruin Creation (salting fields, burning homes, poison-ing rivers, orchestrating massacres to expand shadowlands, and so forth). Additionally, embracing this Charm raises the Abyssal's value in the eyes of the Neverborn above all other servants of Oblivion; hope is kindled in their dead hearts that the Abyssal may finally be the one to end even the Underworld, setting them free. As a result, the Exalt no longer accumulates Resonance for fighting spectres, Nephwracks, Deathlords or any other creatures of death. This Charm cannot be learned by the Deathlords.</description>

        <description>Embracing the doom the Neverborn have crafted them to inflict on the world, Abyssals gain the following benefits:
• Dusk: Like Dawns, the malicious shadows of the Dusk anima deepen until Valor becomes irrelevant, with the same benefits. Additionally, to facilitate the slaying of multitudes, weapons wielded by the Abyssal (including natural weapons) add one to their Defense and two to their Rate.
• Midnight: Zombies raised with the anima power no longer automatically decay.
• Daybreak: As the Twilight benefit, but ap-plicable only to necromancy, not sorcery.
• Day: The Abyssal crawls with concealing shadows, making her difficult to target. When at the (11+)-mote level of display, all attacks against the Abyssal suffer a -1 external penalty.
• Moonshadow: As the Eclipse benefit, save that rather than specifying the circumstances of botches, the Moonshadow may instead choose to immediately inflict a Dark Fate manifestation on the oathbreaker constructed with a number of successes equal to the number of botches that would have been otherwise inflicted.</description>

        <description>This Charm renders the Abyssal's anima into a comforting shroud of necrotic energy. While shining at the eight-mote level of display, the Abyssal is not subject to any penalties due to being rejected by Creation (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Abyssals, p. 95). Nothing within the radius of the anima (identical to that of the Solar version) is affected by the light of the sun unless that light is produced by a magical source carrying the Holy keyword.</description>

        <description>Wielding the power of soulsteel, a deathknight may draw Essence from his victims. This Charm enhances that proclivity. If the Exalt has an Overdrive pool, he may select to divert soulsteel-drained motes to his Overdrive pool. If the deathknight selects to place all the motes reaped from a single attack into his Overdrive pool, he gains an additional offensive mote.</description>

        <description>When the Dragon-Blooded stormed the Calibration Banquet, unleashing blood and burning hell upon the stunned Lawgivers, the Sidereals thought they were saving Creation. But they may have created their worst enemy. The beast of the Usurpation stalks Creation, twisted by the murder that was done to him. All his memories of those halcyon days have been rent by the savage claws of a rough beast, transforming him into a living nightmare of Creation's past. This Charm grants the character an Overdrive pool with a capacity of fifteen motes. Initially empty, it may be filled under the following circumstances:
• If the Abyssal encounters the reincarnation of a Sidereal who participated in the Usurpation -
• If the Abyssal encounters a Sidereal who participated in the Usurpation -
• If the Abyssal encounters a Lunar who survived the Usurpation -
• If the Abyssal encounters his Lunar mate -
• If the Abyssal encounters a Solar or Infernal who was a member of his circle in a past life -
    - if any of these chance meetings should occur, roll the Abyssal's Willpower, regardless of whether the Exalt is aware of his past relationships to any of these characters. For every success on this roll, the Abyssal gains two offensive motes. For a gain of four motes or less, the Abyssal feels a welling up of terrible forces urging him to kill the character that has triggered his Overdrive. This may be accompanied by flashes of his death at the Usurpation braced by images of happier times, bloodstained and darkened by contrast.
   This compulsion is not strong enough to force the deathknight's hand. However, if he gains six or more motes from this roll, the Abyssal's player must immediately roll Join Battle, as the Abyssal goes into a frenzy of relentless attack against the character that triggered his Overdrive. He may not retreat, nor may he resist attacking the target character. Once he has accepted six or more offensive motes from this Charm, either the deathknight or his victim's fate is sealed. The Abyssal gains one offensive mote per action under the effects of this Overdrive, and will not cease attacking until his target is dead or has fled the scene beyond his ability to follow. If the target escapes the Abyssal, the deathknight's murderous trance terminates at the end of the scene.
   The roll for this Charm occurs the first time in any scene where the Exalt encounters a valid target. It may not be rolled more than once per scene. It will, however, trigger each and every time the Abyssal encounters the same valid target across multiple scenes.
   The only way for the Abyssal to resist this Charm is to pay two Willpower before rolling. Doing so prevents the player from making the Willpower roll against a single trigger character for one week. However, if that character is present when the Abyssal's player rolls Join Battle for any reason, the Abyssal's player must also make the roll for this Overdrive, and if he accrues eight or more motes, the beast of the Usurpation is reborn, and the onslaught begins. During this time, the Abyssal may attack any other character but the one he wishes to spare, until all other opponents are incapacitated. For lack of any other targets, the Abyssal will invariably turn his attack upon the target of his Overdrive.</description>
        <comment>On Bright Days Painted Black: "The beast of the Usurpation is one of my personal Abyssal concepts. He is the avatar of judgment created by the greatest act of murder ever perpetrated. But his vengeance is not only for the Sidereals who betrayed him. It is for the gods who made him, the Unconquered Sun who created him, the Yozis that necessitated him. It is for the Lunars who stood by while the knives fell on the back of an Age, and for the Lawgivers who remind him of what he once was. I particularly enjoy the feeling of graduated crisis that comes from using this Charm. The horror of a dark power taking over. Just in time for Halloween." -Ø</comment>

        <description>With each sunset the Abyssal is renewed, catalyzed by the symbolic dying of the Unconquered Sun. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it gains five motes whenever the sun sets while the Abyssal is in the engagement range of one or more enemy, regardless of whether he is rolled into battle. This power is conferred by more than just the actual dying of the light; each time a non-extra opponent incurs a larger wound penalty as a direct result of the deathknight's actions, the Abyssal gains a number of offensive motes equal to twice the wound penalty's value. For example, a character being driven down to a -4 wound penalty would grant eight offensive motes.</description>

        <description>Filling her heart and mind with the glories of death, the Abyssal becomes briefly inured to the beauty of the world around her. The red lips of a paramour, the divine authority of a shining Exalt - how could such trifles compare to the black majesty of the grave and what lies beyond? Activating this Charm in response to a social attack, the Abyssal becomes immune to any penalties that might be imposed by the attacker's Appearance rating. At Essence 3+ this Charm's duration becomes one action.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal knows that all of life is pain and revels in the joy of knowing that Oblivion will end it all. The first time in any story the Abyssal is brought to a new wound penalty, he gains a number of Willpower points equal to that penalty. This effect cannot increase his Willpower points above his permanent rating, and he cannot gain this benefit again until a new story begins. Charms that increase a character's wound penalties do not grant the Abyssal more temporary Willpower points. Only by suffering levels of damage that genuinely injure him does he gain the Willpower, though such damage may be self-inflicted.</description>

        <description>The first step to breaking an enemy is understanding what he cares about. An Abyssal can use this Charm against anyone he can see. His player rolls (Perception + Investigation) against the target's Dodge MDV. If the roll succeeds, the Abyssal learns the target's Motivation. Each threshold success adds knowledge of the target's current intentions in the scene (which can change as circumstances warrant), the target's Intimacies and the target's Virtue ratings. The Abyssal can also seek knowledge of a ghost's fetters. The Abyssal can select how to "spend" these threshold successes and can specify whether he wants positive or negative Intimacies. He can also filter out Intimacies that he already know or feels sure about, though the player must make note beforehand of what Intimacies to filter. The Spectral keyword represents that the Charm costs an additional Willpower point when used against anyone but the dead.
   The target immediately feels that a malevolent presence is trying to invade her mind, but she cannot identify the source of the intrusion. The target may spend two Willpower points to resist the unnatural mental influence. If she does so, the Abyssal may not target her with this Charm for the rest of the day.
   Afterward, Soul-Invading Glance erases the target's memory of the intrusion as an Illusion effect. Only if the target resists through Willpower (or escapes the Charm through a perfect defense against mental influence) does she remember that something attempted to violate her mind.</description>

        <description>The inevitability of entropy is predicated on the hypocrisies of the righteous. Even the Unconquered Sun, supposed shining paragon of virtue, could be bribed to forsake Creation for the bliss of eternal victory in the Games of Divinity. The Abyssal may activate this Charm during any social interaction with a target character, requiring a (Perception + Investigation) roll. Unlike its Solar Mirror, however, the difficulty is equal to the target's Temperance or Essence (whichever is highest). On a success, the target's player reveals her character's price. If the Abyssal meets this price, the target feels a sense of incalculable dread and hears the distant mocking laughter of the Neverborn at the back of her mind as they claim ownership of her.</description>

        <description>Even after death, some knowledge lingers in the Essence of a corpse. Cadavers imbued with the deathknight's Essence open their mouths and speak in feeble gasps but have no real personality and no further animation. The corpse understands the languages the person knew in life.
   Corpses cannot lie or hide the truth, but the (former) person's effective Intelligence drops by one for each week after death, to a minimum of 1. Ancient, unearthed skulls can barely comprehend anything more than the simplest yes-or-no questions. Magic that forestalls decay also preserves the corpse's Intelligence, while the best Sijanese embalming stabilizes a corpse at Intelligence 2.
   A headless corpse offers no impediment to this Charm. In that case, the Abyssal simply eats a handful of the cadaver's flesh or gnaws on a bone for a while. The answer to his question appears in his mind.</description>

        <description>While the Abyssal activates this charm he promises to destroy what his victim loves. For the rest of the scene, whenever the deathknight follows through on his threats by killing or otherwise destroying the subject of any positive Intimacy the victim holds and the victim can perceive the loss, the victim automatically loses three points of Willpower. (Deathknight victims gain two points of Resonance as well, while other Exalted victims gain two points of Limit). Revealing incontrovertible evidence that the Abyssal previously destroyed an Intimacy subject that the victim did not know had been destroyed achieves the same effect. The Intimacy itself does not fade, though it might shift context slightly toward remembering the loss if the victim wishes.
   Only a perfect defense against mental influence can block the effects of this trauma. If a victim of lesser Essence than the Abyssal falls to zero Willpower points in the same scene as she loses the subject of an Intimacy, her will instantly breaks from the anguish of the loss (Exalted, p. 174). Mortals broken thus may be given normally unacceptable orders, such as killing themselves. Celestial Exalted are explicitly immune to being broken by this Charm, but only the most heartless sociopaths have nothing to fear from Heart-Rending Cruelty Technique.</description>

        <description>The laws of fate make sure that objects do not change locations except by physically traversing the intervening space. It gives comfort to the natives of Creation that the world works this way, and therefore greater joy to Abyssals to flout this law and shatter the illusion of security. This Charm enhances any Larceny-based action to steal objects small enough to carry with one hand or to perform feats of prestidigitation such as card tricks or shell games. The target objects can be taken or moved anywhere within (Larceny + Essence) yards away through subtle teleportation as if they were immediately at hand. Taking an object in active use is beyond the scope of this Charm, though deathknights can steal objects out of locked safes or behind walls if they have some way of accurately perceiving them.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances an Abyssal's innate bite attack (see p. 95), allowing her to absorb a victim's visage with the stolen Essence. The Abyssal gains no motes from the attack but must have been able to do so for this Charm to function.
   As Face-Drinking Bite activates, the Abyssal's outward appearance shimmers and warps into an exact likeness of the victim. Current clothing may be copied as part of the ruse, though an actual disguise is more versatile since it may be removed without disappearing. For as long as the mask remains intact, the Abyssal replaces her Appearance rating with the victim's at the time of the bite. This perfect unnatural Illusion fools all senses, even those with superhuman acuity, though anyone with reason to suspect a ruse may spend four Willpower points to see past it and perceive the Abyssal as she truly is for one day. (This stricter scrutiny costs only one Willpower point if the skeptic has seen through the specific illusion before). Onlookers with any form of Essence-based perception (such as Measure the Wind or All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight) also see through this Charm automatically without effort on their part.
       Keep in mind that most people do not immediately leap to the conclusion that a person who acts strangely is actually a doppelganger unless they have experience with such tricks.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances its prerequisite, expanding the scope and effectiveness of the disguise. Each feature added to Face-Drinking Bite raises the Charm's cost by an additional Willpower point.
    Essence: The illusion can now fool Essence-based perception, though only with a usual opposed roll for the Charms. Magical senses fooled thus register the Abyssal as having whatever properties and traits the victim had at the time of feeding, such as Essence rating, type of being and so on.
   Intuition: While hiding in another's face, the Abyssal knows whenever she is in the presence of an Intimacy that belonged to that victim at the time of feeding. She also knows the emotional context of that Intimacy in order to guide her expected response. She knows Intimacies only upon encountering them, not up front as part of activating the disguise.
       Kiss: The Abyssal does not actually need to inflict damage to take a face; it is enough to kiss her prey as a harmless bite. A deathknight can emulate another Abyssal by touching her lips to his Monstrance of Celestial Portion.
       Recall: The Abyssal may pay one experience point to memorize a particular disguise so that it is not lost when she deactivates Face-Drinking Bite. She may thereafter don that illusion as if she had the victim on hand to feed from, but the illusion is dated to the point when it was memorized and does not reflect any changes the victim might have undergone since then.</description>

        <description>This twisted Charm helps Abyssals reinforce Immaculate propaganda and undermine Solar heroism by fooling onlookers into believing deathknights are actually Lawgivers. An Abyssal who used this Charm along with Face-Drinking Bite could pose as a particular Solar. Renegades sometimes use this Charm more nobly or pathetically, draping themselves in the trappings of light as if repeating the lie might somehow make it true.
   This Charm makes the character appear to belong to the corollary Caste (Day to Night, etc.), altering her anima banner and caste mark accordingly. It also reverses any blatantly inhuman changes to appearance wrought by the Black Exaltation, so a withered, disease-ravaged or rotted deathknight can again look like a living human. Most importantly, deceived onlookers rationalize all Abyssal Charms the character uses as if they were actually Solar Charms, perceiving them as Mirror Charms where such exist.
   Solar Impersonation Style's Illusion automatically fools all mundane senses, but Essence-based perceptions see through the fraud. The Exalt's Lunar mate and anyone with higher Essence rating than the Abyssal can also see through the trickery for a day if their players make a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll against a difficulty equal to the Abyssal's Larceny rating. Otherwise, the illusion is absolute and continues to alter perception even if the observer conclusively knows the truth.</description>

        <description>Sometimes the most instructive perspectives in life come from outside one's self. A deathknight may demonstrate the folly of a person's ways by showing her target the way in which the world sees him. The Abyssal must have a head-sized object carved with an effigy-face, such as a gourd or a pumpkin, and must have it to hand (prepared with a miscellaneous Draw/Ready weapon action) in order to use this Charm. The character makes a (Dexterity + Larceny) roll, opposed by the target's highest DV (Essence-users impose a -3 external penalty on this roll); should this attack succeed, the Abyssal quickly steals the target's head, replacing it with the prepared replacement. This does not kill the target. Instead, the victim may now see himself as the Abyssal does.
   The effigy head of the victim becomes animate, capable of the simplest phrases and mannerisms. It knows all of the victim's Intimacies and has full control of the victim's body. Its Motivation is to subtly murder the target's positive Intimacies, starting with family and friends, by means of baroque betrayals, staged accidents, and the like, typically beginning with helpless loyalties such as pets. It does these things through seemingly oblique acts of cruelty extending from parodies of the victim's own shortcomings, like leaving a dangerous object at the top of the stairs where someone will likely trip and fall, or by placing sharp bones in a beloved pet's repast. Should the effigy work through all of the victim's Intimacies, or should the victim have no positive Intimacies to begin with, the thing moves off into the world to seek victims at random, with a preference for the weak and the unwitting. If confronted, the effigy attempts to flee rather than fight. The effigy is unable to make use of any of the victim's Essence-based powers, but uses their dice pools otherwise. Destroying the effigy-head renders the body comatose until its head is returned.
   While in this condition, the victim's head may witness all the actions the effigy takes, and even speak to and be answered by the Abyssal, but no one else may hear him. The victim's severed head may use any Charms that might be beneficial in his reduced state (generally meaning social magic, Awareness Charms, and soak-boosting effects), and may make social attacks against the Abyssal, but can take no other actions of real consequence. Meanwhile, the effigy controlling his body appears to all who see it to be the victim. This unnatural Illusion is treated as a social attack accumulating ten automatic successes, which costs three points of Willpower to see through.
   Unlike most Charms, the Abyssal may not voluntarily drop the mote commitment that sustains Malicious Parody Imposter so long as the victim's head is separated from his body. The Charm may end only when the Abyssal returns the victim's head to his body, or when the victim dies. Other characters may not return the victim's head to his body while the Abyssal lives; they must coerce or convince the deathknight to end his cruel lesson. If the Abyssal is dead, the victim's head may be reattached by any character who puts it back in its proper place.</description>

        <description>This Charm allows the Abyssal to disguise his subject as a ghost. This disguise includes a forged identity with Underworld-based Influence equal to the Abyssal's Essence. Characters using Charms to examine a subject under the effect of Death Dealer's Chance conclude that he is a ghost (add the Abyssal's Larceny in extra dice to the roll-off). For most intents and purposes, the subject is a ghost: he respires Essence as a creature of death, is immaterial in Creation, tangible at night in shadowlands, and so forth. The target does not become a creature of darkness, nor are they subject to any effects that specifically act upon ghosts, such as the necromancy spell “Summon Ghost.” The subject gains no Arcanoi and may continue to use his own Essence-based powers, should he have any.
   The subject must freely agree to have this Charm used upon him and may not be magically coerced into giving consent. Upon activation, the Abyssal begins a signature game of chance with the subject. Sometimes this Charm takes the form of a card game; other Abyssals prefer a series of riddles; others still roll dice, draw stones, or engage in challenges stranger still. The process varies from Exalt to Exalt, but always concludes in three stages. The subject rolls (Wits + a relevant Ability determined by the Storyteller) against a climbing difficulty in each game: difficulty 1 for the first game, 2 for the second, and 3 for the third. The Abyssal may not aid or hinder these rolls in any way. With each successive victory, the target feels himself changing. First his body grows numb and cold. Second, he begins to see the shadowy vapors of the dead (if ghosts are present) and hears the whispers of the Neverborn. Finally he is remade as a ghost and, if in Creation, dematerializes instantly. If, however, the target fails at any of these rolls, the results may be tragic: Exalts take (Abyssal's Essence) levels of unsoakable lethal damage, while mortals immediately perish. If the subject's nerve breaks and he abandons the games before the third roll is complete, he merely forfeits all Willpower. Should the Abyssal depart with the games unfinished, he instead suffers this fate.
   The subject may end this disguise at any time by spending a point of Willpower and using a Speed 5, DV -2 miscellaneous action to tear away the gauzy Essence enshrouding him. The disguise otherwise dissipates at the rising of the next full moon, when Luna smiles to uncover the ruses of ghost and shadow. This occurs wherever the character may be.</description>

        <description>The deathknight may borrow the hideous fluency of the Neverborn, facilitating communication with other creatures of darkness. While this Charm is active, the Abyssal mentally hears a rasping and eerie "overdubbing" in her native language whenever a creature of darkness speaks to her. This Charm provides no translation when the speaker does not intend to address the deathknight. Nor can it translate any positive emotional concepts such as professions of love or respect, since the Neverborn no longer understand such ideas in any meaningful capacity. Hollow or ironic honorifics do translate, however. The slain Primordials understand pettiness and spite with a vocabulary beyond imagination.
   In addition to translation, Infinite Blasphemy Glossolalia also gives Abyssals the ability to speak in a guttural rasping hiss that is understood by any creature of darkness who hears it, provided the Abyssal does not try to convey a positive emotional concept. Everyone else hears the language as disturbing gibberish. (Charms that translate unknown languages can do so normally).
   The Taint drawback to this Charm renders the Abyssal incapable of speaking any other language without spending one Willpower per scene, and he can never make any positive emotional statement. The Taint costs four bonus points or eight experience points.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal no longer needs to waste her breath on words and may hold telepathic conversations without worrying about eavesdroppers. Upon activating this Charm, the deathknight chooses a target she can perceive within (Linguistics x 100) yards. That target instantly understands who proposes telepathic contact.
   If the target resists this intrusion, the Abyssal's player can roll (Manipulation + Linguistics + Essence) against the target's Dodge MDV. Success forces the target to either consent or spend three Willpower points to deny the unnatural mental influence for the rest of the scene.
   Once the Abyssal establishes contact, she and the target may telepathically speak to one another for the rest of the scene as long as the target remains within range. The two actually "speak" their thoughts using any languages they know and wish to use, so this Charm cannot overcome language barriers. This Charm may be activated multiple times to create links with different targets, but doing so does not create a network for the targets to communicate with each other.
   Any use of this Charm on an Abyssal's Monstrance of Celestial Portion results in immediate telepathic contact with the Abyssal. The deathknight cannot resist.</description>

Doing so adds the Social keyword and changes the Charm's type to Simple (Speed 6 in long ticks), though.</description>

If she has used Screaming in Silence on a particular creature of Death before, she does not even need to perceive that target to initiate contact, though her player must roll as described for that Charm. Contact fails if that target is outside range or the roll fails. The Abyssal may still use Screaming in Silence normally to contact beings who are not creatures of Death.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances an Abyssal's innate bite attack (see p. 95), allowing him to steal a victim's fluency in a language. If the Exalt gains any motes from the attack, he also knows what languages the victim speaks and may choose one of them. The victim forgets how to understand, read, write or speak the chosen language until she spends three Willpower points to heal the mental damage, though doing so does not reduce her actual Linguistics rating.
       Meanwhile, the Abyssal gains total fluency in the chosen language for as long as he commits motes to this Charm, including a specialty in the victim's dialect. This effect does not increase his actual Linguistics rating. If the victim cannot read, the Abyssal does not gain written fluency in the language.
   This Charm may be separately activated any number of times to take multiple languages, provided the Abyssal commits Essence for each tongue. An Abyssal with experience to spend can also permanently digest a stolen language as a diceless miscellaneous action, terminating the Charm to instantly raise the Abyssal's Linguistics rating and/or purchase the appropriate dialect specialty as a Training effect. Doing so returns the victim's language fluency.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal speaks one word that is not merely incomprehensible, but aggressively antithetical to understanding. Roll the Exalt's (Manipulation + Linguistics + Essence). Every non-deaf being within a radius of (Linguistics x 100) yards who has a Dodge MDV less than the number of successes rolled falls victim to the Charm's unnatural mental influence. Those afflicted find themselves unable to parse meaning from any form of communication, whether written, spoken, body language or something more exotic. Social interactions and coordinated tactics become impossible. Affected units cannot take on new orders, though they can still follow existing orders, respond to stimuli or attack units with which they are engaged. Ultimately, the Storyteller remains final arbiter of what is and isn't possible while victims are denied comprehension, though the effects are generally quite brutal and farreaching.
   Note that the Abyssal is not automatically immune to the unholy word. His player compares the successes to the character's own Dodge MDV to see if he is affected. Overcoming the vicious Illusion of this Charm costs three Willpower points. The cost may be paid in installments, but the confusion lasts until the character pays the final point. Once a unit leader pays this cost - which usually happens within a scene - the rest of his unit may be assumed to have done so and the unit functions normally, though this weakens individual unit members normally if it becomes necessary to deal with them as individuals.</description>

        <description>This Charm draws upon the cold inevitability of the Underworld as a weapon against Chaos. The Abyssal can target a single Fair Folk he can perceive. His player rolls (Willpower + [Essence or Whispers]) against the raksha's Dodge MDV. Success means that the raksha cannot use Shaping effects for the rest of the story unless its Essence equals or exceeds that of the Abyssal. Even then, the Fair Folk's player must beat the Abyssal's activation successes with a reflexive (Willpower + Essence) roll for each Shaping action.
   At Lore 5, Essence 4, an Abyssal can attack an entire waypoint of the Wyld with this Charm. He must occupy the waypoint. This attack alters the waypoint's geography and environmental conditions for one scene into any terrain that can be made with Nightmare-Carving Murmur (q.v).. The tainted waypoint also negates all Shaping effects taken on it by other characters with an Essence rating less than the Abyssal. Shaping effects from equal or higher Essence beings similarly fail unless their player beats the Abyssal's activation successes with a reflexive (Willpower + Essence) roll for each action. After the scene ends, warped terrain dissolves back into its original state.</description>

        <description>This Charm enables a deathknight to feed at a distance without breaking her victim's skin. The deathknight can target creatures up to (Essence x 10) yards away with an unexpected attack using a (Perception + Lore) roll. The victim suffers lethal damage equal to the number of successes, soakable only with Stamina, while the deathknight gains one mote per level of damage inflicted. A victim feels the attack only as a sudden weakness or twinge of pain.
   Without magical perception, a victim can recognize the source of this attack through a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll at difficulty 5, rolled with each attack. Success means the victim recognizes the Abyssal as the source of his sudden weakness, allowing him to dodge attacks that are no longer unexpected. Otherwise, the victim remains clueless as to what is wounding his soul.
   Alternatively, the deathknight can target another creature's Essence pool and directly steal one mote per success on the attack roll. The Charm becomes Obvious, however, as stolen energies glimmer in faint contrails from the victim to the Abyssal's mouth.</description>

            <errText>Any motes granted by this Charm are attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Abyssal's Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Abyssal may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</errText>

        <description>This Charm expands the utility of its prerequisite, enabling the Abyssal to drain any of a victim's remaining channels from selected Virtues as if they were Willpower points. The deathknight can consume drained channels for one Willpower point each or use them to replenish spent channels of the same Virtue. The character can mix-and-match, draining Willpower and channels with the same attack, though the Abyssal always has the option of attacking another Virtue or Willpower if one pool runs dry before the attack has consumed its maximum capacity.</description>

        <description>The Chosen Of the Void generously impart their own dark enlightenment. The Abyssal can open a willing pupil's mind to the chthonic glory of the Neverborn, teaching him one dot of Whispers as a Training effect. This psychic onslaught incidentally strips the student of all his remaining Willpower points. If the student has experience to spend, he can permanently gain one dot of Whispers for three experience points. If not, he has Whispers for as long as the deathknight chooses to continue paying one Willpower per day. Students need not understand what they are about to receive, provided they do not resist when they feel the skittering murmur caress the back of their mind.</description>

        <description>Abyssals bloat themselves with stolen motes to sustain them on extended forays into Creation, feeding on the terror and death they cause. The secondary pool of Peripheral Essence can be filled using the Abyssal's innate bite attack or by terrorizing and harming a town, army, organization or other social or military unit. Every hour actively spent ravaging the populace - from murders in the night to burning the crops or shaking down peasants for taxes they cannot pay - enables the Abyssal to recover motes equal to the unit's Magnitude.</description>

        <description>As Lawgivers give form to the chaos of the Wyld, so may Abyssals impose the horrors of their imagination on the Under-world. This Charm is an extended dramatic action using a dice pool of the Abyssal's (Intelligence + Lore). Each roll requires five hours of work, and the character must pay the Charm's cost with each roll. The base difficulty is 3 in the Labyrinth and 10 in the Underworld. Accumulated successes may be spent at any time in increments up to five successes on any of the following effects, shaping an area no farther than a number of miles equal to the Abyssal's Essence from the epicenter of the Exalt:
   Demesne: The deathknight drills into the deepest inchoate madness of the Neverborn, allowing their Essence to bleed up from beneath and coagulate into an Abyssal demesne with a rating equal to the successes spent.
   Land: The Exalt alters the Underworld's geography as desired, provided that the changes make the area more inherently desolate, inhospitable, frightening or dangerous. The number of successes required depends on the Resources value of the new land. Ore rich volcanoes bubbling with the smoldering quicksilver blood of the Neverborn, for example, would cost more successes to create than barren fog-shrouded plains.
   Magical Things: The Abyssal applies successes from this Charm directly to the creation rolls for Abyssal manses or destructive artifacts as defined by World-Slaying Arsenal Epiphany (see p. 153) and is explicitly permitted to supplement this process with Craft Charms such as Soul-Forging Fury.
   Wealth: The deathknight cracks open fissures revealing long-forgotten grave goods conforming to his desires with a Resources value equal to the successes spent.
   Objects created with this Charm crumble into Oblivion upon their destruction and follow the same material state as ghosts if removed from the Underworld. Such items also disintegrate into oily, putrid smoke when touched by the light of Creation's sun.
   Any use of this Charm offends the Neverborn, who object to their destroyers creating anything. The Abyssal gains one Resonance point for every dice roll in the extended action. If the character's Resonance total reaches 10, he suffers an immediate Resonance eruption.</description>

        <description>With greater depravity and force of will Abyssals may impose permanent changes to the realms of the dead. This Charm improves its prerequisite with additional capabilities:
   Wealth: Unearthed grave goods may be given full solidity and immunity to sunlight by feeding slain beings into a fissure before disturbing its treasures. Such sacrifices conform to the Resources equivalent for prayer offerings as defined on p. 132 of Exalted and must have a value equal to or greater than the value of the goods the Abyssal wishes to take into Creation.
   Artifacts: If the Abyssal creates an artifact with Nightmare-Carving Murmur using materials imported from the shadowlands, it is fully solid and immune to sunlight. Such wonders are more difficult to create and cannot have their construction speeded by more than tenfold, though appropriate Craft Charms may supplement and speed the process as normal.
   People: The Exalt may alter a person or social unit in range with Nightmare-Carving Murmur, applying an external penalty equal to the target's Essence rating (for an individual creature of Death) or Dodge MDV (for all other targets). Success allows the Abyssal to change the target's Motivation to anything involving harm and impose a number of mutation points on all affected characters equal to the deathknight's Essence rating. These muta-tions must increase the target's suffering or its capacity to inflict suffering on others. A target may resist this change outright at a cost of four Willpower points, or two points to limit the possible scope of the change with a single condition approved by the Storyteller. If the Abyssal tries to shape social units, add the unit's Magnitude to the Essence or Dodge MDV of its leader, and the leader spends Loyalty to resist the changes.
   Vision: If the Abyssal has Whispers 1+, he may shape areas of the Labyrinth at difficulty 1 whenever he alters it in fulfillment of the revealed will of the Neverborn shown to him in a Whispers vision.
   Shaping the Labyrinth in response to the Whispers is the only use of this Charm that the Neverborn do not count as a grievous sin against Oblivion. The Abyssal gains two Resonance for every dice roll in the extended action, and suffers an immediate Resonance eruption when the act of creation ends, using all the accumulated Resonance.</description>

        <description>With a touch an Abyssal imparts some of his own monstrous hunger and consumptive Essence into a patient. For the duration of the Charm, the patient smells all other members of her own species as if they were the finest delicacies and idly imagines biting into them. This faint sensory distortion does not compel her to act on the impulses, but if she gives in to this hunger, she finds that the fresh blood or meat of her own kind sates her on a level that normal food cannot. Every three lethal health levels consumed heals one level of lethal damage or two levels of bashing damage. After the Charm ends, her senses return to normal. Exalted are considered humans for the purposes of this Charm and Abyssals may enchant themselves with Cannibalistic Renewal Incitement, though deathknights regain no motes from health levels consumed for healing purposes. Once a character heals a total of (her Stamina + Essence) health levels with all activations of this Charm, she must wait a full day to digest before this limit resets and she can feed again.</description>

        <description>When the Abyssal bites a victim, she can pay one Willpower whenever she consumes one or more health levels from him. Doing so sucks out all Sickness effects from a patient's body. The Abyssal must check for normal exposure to all communicable illnesses removed thus. Fortunately, deathknights' inherent immunities to non-magical diseases minimize this danger, making this Charm an excellent way to stock up on plagues to spread to others. Purchasing this Charm also allows the Abyssal to suppress her autonomic immune response to any Sickness effect she carries so that her Essence-infused body does not cleanse it out before she has a chance to use it. Unlike the Sickness effects created by Pestilence-Bearing Touch, these are true infections: The Abyssal can spread them using only their normal vectors.</description>

        <description>One Disease, the Great Contagion killed more people than all of Creation's wars put together. The Chosen of the Void can use the lethal power of disease. If the Abyssal can touch a living creature, she can expose that person or animal to any natural disease that she has ever imbibed through Plague-Eating Kiss. Doing so requires an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll at a difficulty one lower than the disease's Virulence. The target's player then rolls (Stamina + Resistance) against the disease's Virulence. The supernaturally induced disease behaves like the natural disease in every way, except it is not contagious.
   When a character learns this Charm, she selects one natural disease (see Exalted, pp. 351-353) that she can induce. Characters can induce one additional disease at a cost of one experience point each, or two per bonus point spent on this Charm.
   At Essence 4, Abyssals can learn to induce supernatural diseases such as Green Rage, White Sun Sickness (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Lunars, pp. 212-213), Drunken Moth Sickness or Broken-Tile Organ Condition (see Scroll of the Monk, p. 125). These diseases all come from the first two circles of supernatural disease (defined in Scroll of the Monk, p. 154). At Essence 5, Abyssals can learn to induce Third Circle supernatural diseases, including a comparatively mild strain of the Great Contagion -it's actually treatable. Finding most supernatural diseases is left as a challenge to the deathknight. Some Death-lords, however, keep samples of the Great Contagion for their servants.</description>

        <description>Although it is often quicker to animate a new zombie than bother stitching a damaged thrall back together, some Abyssals take a frugal approach to their hordes. This Charm can repair a number of bashing or lethal health levels up to the Exalt's Medicine rating to any corpse or cadaverous automaton (such as walking dead or necromantic war machines). The Abyssal must have immediate access to sufficient body parts to replace all damaged components, though the magic of the Charm fuses these pieces together without need for stitches or tools. Depending on the Abyssal's intent, a fully mended cadaver may appear as a grotesque patchwork of mismatched organs or look so lively and fresh that it could pass for one of the living.</description>

        <description>Although Abyssal surgeons lack the power or inclination to actually heal Crippling injuries, this Charm enables them to surgically implant undead prosthetics that exactly match the functionality of the organs they replace. This operation is an hour-long dramatic action for which the Abyssal's player rolls (Intelligence + Medicine) at difficulty 5. If successful, the surgery "cures" any one Crippling effect by fusing an implant with the adjoining tissue, though the replacement remains non-functional for the first day until the patient's body acclimates to it. Abyssals may use this Charm to repair themselves, but doing so increases the difficulty to 7.
   Depending on the surgeon's style and preference, implants created with this Charm may follow any permutation of undead physiology, be they half-rotted zombie organs, elegant clock-work assemblages of articulated bone or even beautifully pallid simulacra barely distinguishable from life. Note that mortals become creatures of Death and creatures of darkness if they ever have more undead tissue than living tissue.</description>

        <description>With knowledge of life comes the power to build its parody. The Abyssal touches a corpse and infuses the decaying remnants of its chakras with Essence, animating it as a non-extra zombie (see Exalted, p. 314). This monster obeys its creator to the limits of its meager Intelligence, understanding simple commands phrased in the native language of the person it once was. The creature suffers one unsoakable level of bashing damage per day from accelerated putrefaction, though this decay may be repaired with Charnel Chirurgeon Deftness or arrested with Eternal Embalming Preparation (see pp. 151-152).</description>

        <description>The Abyssal transcends vulnerability to maiming injuries. As long as the deathknight has sufficient cadaverous material anywhere within (Essence x 100) yards, this Charm violently rips assorted body parts into the air and pulls their shredded pieces into the Abyssal's wounds, assembling a prosthetic "cure" for a Crippling effect like one created with Bone Graft Technique. This implant requires no roll to build, however, and may be used immediately without a day of convalescence.
       More gruesomely, this Charm can replace any number of existing implants or undamaged tissue in a single activation, in which case the rejected organs shred themselves into a cloud of gore and bone fragments before reassembling to fit the Abyssal's vision. A total redesign of a character's body adds an amount equal to his Essence rating to the difficulty of any rolls to recognize him as the person he used to look like. This does not aide in impersonation attempts and cannot alter a person's sex or other core structural aspects of his physiological identity. (For instance, the Abyssal can't make a sharkman look like a true human). Height, weight and apparent age are fair game, allowing deathknights Exalted as children to overcome their inherent stasis when they feel they have outgrown their current body. The Appearance Attribute may be increased with appropriate alterations, bypassing the need for training time but costing normal experience.</description>

        <description>Death lurks in all mortal beings like a seed waiting to germinate. An Abyssal master of disease who does not wish to inadvertently slay useful pawns or valued allies with the horrors he unleashes may spare them with this Charm. Leaning close, the Abyssal breathes in a small fraction of the potential for death within a living being; this requires mouth-to-body contact, and is generally accomplished either through a bite or a kiss. So long as the Abyssal commits Essence to this Charm, the target becomes fully immune to one disease the Abyssal is capable of bestowing with Pestilence-Bearing Touch. An individual may be targeted by multiple activations of this Charm to immunize her to different diseases, and the Abyssal may also sustain the Charm's effects on multiple individuals at once, if he desires. Using this Charm on any living individual whose continued existence is not of direct material benefit to the Abyssal inflicts one point of Resonance.
   Alternately, the Abyssal may activate this Charm on a character already harboring a disease he has inflicted with Pestilence-Bearing Touch. This immunizes the target against the disease's symptoms'they will not suffer or die from the ailment�but leaves them fully infected and contagious, capable of spreading their disease to the living while appearing hale and healthy. Attempts to diagnose a target whose symptoms have been devoured in this manner suffer a -3 external penalty. When the Abyssal releases the motes to committed to the Charm, the victim's symptoms will return in full. Using the Charm in this manner never grants Resonance.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits the Abyssal to pay a two-mote surcharge when animating a zombie with Life-Mocking Assembly. The walking dead enhanced in this fashion are infectious and possessed of a great hunger for the flesh of the living (though they still obey the Abyssal's orders, including orders not to indulge this craving). Any living individual slain by the zombie will rise again within 1-10 minutes as a non-infectious zombie extra. These extras are also possessed of the risen hunger, but are neither infectious nor under the Abyssal's control. Extras lose their animation after one day has passed during which they are unable to consume the flesh of the living.
   At Essence 4+ and again at each subsequent Essence rating, the Abyssal may enhance the Charm with one of the following options:
• Zombie extras rise under the Abyssal's control, obeying orders as though created through Life-Mocking Assembly
• Zombie extras are infectious, as though enhanced with The Risen Hunger. All of their victims, and the victims of their victims, and so on, also rise as infectious undead if the Abyssal has Essence 6+; otherwise, the victims of the second wave of zombies are not infectious.
• Zombie extras may persist for an additional day without feeding before they lose their animation. This option may be selected multiple times as the Abyssal rises in Essence.</description>
        <comment>On The Risen Hunger: "I love zombies. They're easily my favorite monsters of all time.

Moreover, Abyssals and necromancers are sort of built around them - 'have lots of zombies' is supposed to be one of the big perks. So it was important to me to inject a bit of fear back into the undead, and to make them a perk worth having. So... now you can create zombies that kill with a bite. Then their victims get up and kill. The people they kill get up and kill. They still may not be much of a threat to a Solar with daiklave in hand, but an Abyssal zombie specialist can certainly threaten everything in the world that a Solar holds dear." -H</comment>

        <description>Drawing upon his refined understanding of poisons and the destruction they may wreak upon the living body, the Abyssal transforms himself into a font of lethal venom. His heart pumps out blood in a shade closer to black than red, which is slightly sticky and tends to coat surfaces it strikes rather than dripping off - and this blood is lethally toxic. The Abyssal's blood becomes a poison with the following traits: (7L/hour, 3, -/-, -2), which must be ingested or introduced into an open wound or other vulnerable portions of the body (such as the eyes) to take effect. Due to its viscosity, the Abyssal may open a small wound upon his body (inflicting one level of lethal damage) and use his blood to coat one weapon, or up to his Stamina rating in arrows or tiny throwing weapons such as shuriken. Any living being slain with this poison in his system rises one hour later as a zombie identical to those created through Life-Mocking Assembly.
   Alternately, the Abyssal may learn this Charm as a Taint. This makes all of his bodily fluids permanently poisonous - paramours beware.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's heart-venom overflows into all his works as a reanimator. Every zombie the Abyssal personally raises (whether through Life-Mocking Assembly, Vermillion Plague Conscription, necromancy, or any other means) gains a poisonous bite. The bite of the walking dead delivers a toxin identical to that of Black Heart Venom, save that it does not automatically reanimate those slain by it; that final horror is left to other Charms, such as The Risen Hunger or Vermillion Plague Conscription.
   The traits given for a zombie's punch on page 314 of Exalted are also used to model its bite.</description>

        <description>Pain is an art for Abyssal weapon-masters, who wield this Charm to deftly maul and disable specific limbs and organs of their enemies. Enhancing a Melee attack with this Charm imposes an additional external penalty on the attack equal to the target's Essence rating. If the attack inflicts two or more levels of damage, though, the Exalt may reflexively pay an additional +1wp to pull and focus the blow. Doing so inflicts one amputation disability on the victim (see Exalted, p. 152).
   Unless the deathknight has a higher Essence rating than the victim, the worst she can do is crush joints, break bones and sever nerves or tendons - enough to impose all the penalties of amputation without literally lopping off limbs. Exalted victims with higher Essence can heal the Crippling effect by spending a full day resting (during which they cannot heal any other wounds). Abyssals with higher Essence ratings than their victims may carve with impunity, fully amputating and thus requiring more drastic healing magic to repair.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's attack fades to intangibility at the moment of contact, inflicting spiritual injuries instead of physical damage. Provided that the augmented Melee attack inflicts one or more levels of damage, this Charm replaces all levels with a Crippling effect that wounds a trait chosen by the Abyssal. Multiple injuries from this Charm do stack. Possible options include:
    Essence: The victim loses one dot of Essence, recalculating the size of derived traits and bleeding off any motes in excess of the new Essence pool size. Characters cannot activate Charms that require a higher Essence rating than their diminished souls can provide, though they regain access to these Charms as soon as they restore their Essence to appropriate levels. Beings who are reduced to Essence 0 instantly die, their life force snuffed out by Oblivion's touch.
       Virtues: The victim loses one dot from each Virtue (minimum rating of 1), wasting any channels remaining in excess of her new ratings and altering her behavior appropriately. The Virtue used for an Exalt's current Limit Break condition cannot be drained this way.
   Willpower: The victim loses two dots of Willpower, as well as all Willpower points in excess of her new rating. Beings reduced to Willpower 0 shuffle through life like the spent husks left by the Fair Folk, entirely without identity or volition.
   For mortals and creatures of the Wyld, the damage inflicted by this Charm is permanent without powerful magical treatment or normal experience expenditure. Essence-wielders who are not creatures of the Wyld require a day of rest to overcome each use of this Charm on them, during which time they cannot respire Essence or heal in other ways. Activating Transcendent Hero's Meditation (Exalted, p. 201) instantly ignites a Solar back to full power and flares her anima to its iconic level of display.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal learns to strike with impossible speed, fulfilling the Charm's name with blurs of violence that leave bewildered victims covered in countless shallow cuts or bruises. Only a handful of blows have any real force to them, but these are usually sufficient.
   In addition, a character who uses this Charm with a successful flurry may incidentally arrange the wounds inflicted into artful designs or calligraphy to add literal insult to injury. At the Storyteller's option, Solars can do the same with Invincible Fury of the Dawn. If the player can think of something particularly witty or obnoxious for the character to inscribe in blood, the Storyteller might consider granting a stunt bonus.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal conjures a weapon formed of Essence-hardened shadows adorned or intertwined with corpse-elements. Unlike its Solar mirror, Resplendent Shadow Blade is not Holy but imposes an Emotion effect of despair or horror whenever it inflicts any damage, draining one Willpower unless the target spends motes equal to the Abyssal's Essence rating. Mortal extras who somehow survive being hit with this weapon drop prone and curl up in a fetal position for the rest of the scene, too spiritually broken even to defend themselves.</description>

            <description>The Essence of the Abyssal manifests in a weapon formed of Essence-hardened shadows adorned or intertwined with corpse-elements. This blade inflicts aggravated damage to creatures of the Wyld and slightly dims any light brought near it. The Exalt can summon this weapon to her hand from anywhere it has fallen, as a diceless, miscellaneous action.
   The character defines the form of her weapon upon purchasing this Charm. Statistically, the weapon has traits equal to single or paired basic 1, 2 or 3-dot close-range soulsteel artifact weapon (such as a daiklave, grimcleaver, or direlance) of the player's choice. Paired 1-dot weapons or a singular 2-dot weapon costs 3m. Paired 2-dot weapons or a single 3-dot weapon costs 5m. "Brawling aides" such as smashfists are not valid forms.
   Players wishing to have multiple options may purchase this Charm a number of times equal to their character's Melee score, creating a different weapon with each purchase. If the character possesses an Overdrive pool, she gains one offensive mote to that pool each action while she is wielding Resplendent Shadow Blade. The character must be in battle to benefit from the one mote drip. She may only benefit from one drip from weaponry at a time.
   Additionally, this Charm may be purchased a second time to upgrade all weapons that may be created through Resplendent Shadow Blade, granting them the benefits detailed on page 130 of Manual of Exalted Power: Abyssals.</description>

        <description>Even as they steal lives for Oblivion, deathknights may steal weapons from their foes and turn them against their owners. An Abyssal may use this Charm against any weapon within (Essence x 8) yards. Items not wielded by their owner obey without hesitation and fly into the Abyssal's outstretched hand. Seizing a weapon from its owner's hand or a sheath on his person is more difficult, requiring an opposed reflexive roll of the Abyssal's (Manipulation + Melee) against the wielder's (Strength + Melee). If the deathknight wins, the weapon betrays its owner to join its new master, who becomes its new owner (Exalted, p. 238). If the owner wins, the weapon remains where it is and cannot be targeted by Thieving Raiton Claws for the rest of the scene. Thieving Raiton Claws cannot target attuned artifact weapons or weapons made entirely of Essence.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal lunges toward and past her opponent in a single perfect motion, striking so quickly that her opponent's corpse still stands when she glances back over her shoulder to watch him fall in half. Ebon Lightning Prana enables the deathknight to close the distance to any one target within (Essence x 10) yards and strike them with one Melee attack using a pool of (Dexterity + Melee + Essence). The attack is always unexpected and deals piercing damage.
   What's more, the Abyssal does not need to have a weapon in hand to use this Charm, provided she has a weapon available to draw as a reflexive action. If combat has not yet begun, the Abyssal automatically strikes first regardless of Join Battle rolls. If more than one character has such "go first" magic, their players roll Join Battle among themselves or all act simultaneously, at the Storyteller's option.
   A character cannot use Ebon Lightning Prana simply as an easy way to move a long way quickly. The Abyssal must strike at a foe, though she can continue moving past him.</description>

Ebon Lightning Prana allows the Abyssal to move up to (Essence x 8) yards and then make a single Melee attack against an opponent. The Deathknight must have a valid target in range to use this Charm.
   With Essence 3+, the Abyssal can reflexively roll (Dexterity + Stealth) to establish surprise as part of the movement granted by this Charm, paying an additional five motes to do so.</description>

        <description>The Void strikes down weapons that dare to assault its champions. An Abyssal may use this Charm (also called the Corrosive Parry) only when he defends against attack using his Parry DV; his own weapon flares with necrotic Essence. If the parry succeeds, his opponent's weapon crumbles to dust. Weapons made of the magical materials or otherwise enchanted survive the Corrosive Parry but are ripped from their wielder's grasp and hurled a number of yards away equal to the Abyssal' Essence.
   The Essence cost of this Charm is one mote greater than the Damage bonus of the parried weapon. Therefore, disintegrating a knife costs only three motes, while corroding a mace costs nine motes. Wrenching a starmetal grand grimscythe out of a Sidereal foe's hand with a parry would cost 18 motes.</description>

        <description>The deathknight's weapon traces the air like a flame-entranced moth, unerringly darting into the path of incoming attacks as if the weapon's destruction might offer a release from its master's evil. Abyssals with this Charm commonly prepare Death-Deflecting Technique in the realms of the dead before a mission, rather than paying the Willpower surcharge to ready that defense in Creation. Abyssals with Essence 6+ who know Fluttering Moth Defense reduce the cost to activate Death-Deflecting Technique to two motes (+1wp outside the realms of the dead), and may prepare up to their Melee score in invocations of that Charm.</description>

            <description>The deathknight's weapon traces the air like a flame-entranced moth, unerringly darting into the path of incoming attacks as if the weapon's destruction might bring a release from its master's evil. As the Abyssal activates this Charm, a single Melee weapon he wields takes on an eerie life ofits own, writhing and moving in his grip as if seeking some escape. He takes no DV penalties from attacks made with the chosen weapon, and adds +1 to Damage and Defense ratings.
   The Abyssal may also use the enchanted weapon to perfectly parry any attack against him in Step 2, even if that attack is unblockable. Doing so ends this Charm prematurely, as the enchanted weapon finds no release even in the most devastating and destructive of attacks. Once the Abyssal has done so, he cannot reactivate this Charm for the rest of the scene, a limitation that counts as this defense's Flaw of Invulnerability. With Melee 5+, Essence 5+, the deathknight may invoke this defense up to (Essence / 2) times in one scene before this Charm ends.</description>

        <description>Where the chosen of the Void walk they cut down all who stand against them. The deathknight sends her weapon and dozens of shadowy copies spinning through a lightning-fast pattern around herself. As long as she maintains the Hundred Razor Circle, the Abyssal makes one reflexive Melee attack against everyone who comes within three yards of her location. The Abyssal cannot exempt anyone within range. Nor can she move farther than one yard, make any other attacks while the Charm is active or flurry her attacks (even with extra-action Charms) in hopes of striking an enemy more than once. The Abyssal can use her Parry DV against ranged attacks for the Charm's duration, though.</description>

        <description>The controlled, elegant blows of the Abyssal Exalted bring forth great sheets of blood from their victims, transforming battlefields into impromptu artistic performances. This Charm acts as a permanent upgrade to its prerequisite, allowing the Abyssal's player to count extra successes on the attack roll three times rather than twice for the purpose of determining raw damage. A second purchase, at Melee 6+, allows extra successes to be counted four times rather than three, while a third purchase at Melee 8+ allows extra successes to be counted five times. A fourth and final purchase at Melee 9+ causes each extra success to be counted ten times for the purpose of determining raw damage.</description>

        <description>An Abyssal who has learned this Charm fills her hands with a constant cold yearning for life. Any weapon she wields using her Melee Ability enjoys a +2 bonus to its Accuracy, and drains a number of motes equal to the Abyssal's Essence whenever it hits a target and inflicts at least one health level of damage. The Abyssal does not gain these motes; they simply vanish from the world. This Charm's Accuracy bonus stacks with standard magical material bonuses, save that its mote-drain does not double the yield granted by soulsteel weapons; instead it adds one to the number of motes drained.</description>

        <description>This Charm functions identically to its Solar Mirror, save that it permits invocations of Death-Deflecting Technique rather than Heavenly Guardian Defense. The Deathlords are currently Charnel Emperor Stance's only users, and it is worth noting that, like all sets of Mirror Charms, they are only capable of wielding the Abyssal version of this Charm. For all their unholy might or long centuries of practice, the Deathlords have never devised a more efficient or effective form of perfect defense.</description>

            <description>Black Essence spills over the Abyssal's weapon, darkening it until it seems he wields a fragment of Oblivion itself. His blade becomes a manifest eschatology, an unholy incarnation of all his dark majesty and fatal prowess. This Charm is identical to its Solar counterpart, except that it does not add stunt or Virtue dice to damage rolls. Instead, the Abyssal's blade dissolves and unmakes whatever it touches, dealing aggravated damage to everything.</description>

        <description>Some Abyssals are amused when their prey attempts to flee, and savor the chase. Others find such exertions tedious, and use this Charm accordingly. This Charm enhances an attack made with a weapon that inflicts lethal or aggravated damage; if the attack successfully inflicts even a single level of damage, the Abyssal's weapon skewers the victim's body, pinning them to the ground, a wall, a headstone or some other piece of immobile scenery. The Abyssal may withdraw their weapon if they wish; their anima leaves behind an Essence-forged duplicate, holding the victim in place, which vanishes once they are freed by any means.
   When pinned in this fashion, the victim is trapped in place and may not take any action to move away. Pulling free requires a miscellaneous (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of the Abyssal's (Strength + 2). The successes gained on multiple attempts to pull free are added together cumulatively, but the target may only make one such attempt per action, and each attempt inflicts one automatic level of lethal damage. If the victim is subjected to a knockback attack while rooted, this tears them free of the pinning shadow, but inflicts an automatic three levels of lethal damage as the weapon rips through their flesh. All secondary damage inflicted by Pinned Moth Tactic ignores armor-based Hardness.</description>
        <comment>On Pinned Moth Tactic: "This one's a bit unusual. One could, perhaps, call it a 'semi-symmetrical Mirror', except that it's in a completely different Ability than its Solar counterpart. Pinned Moth Tactic isn't quite as easy to land as Shadow Foot Trap, but hurts worse if you can stick it." -H</comment>

        <description>The Ash Child hones his blade into the vector of a thousand little deaths. The skill of his attacks may hold his victims in thrall. This Charm allows the Abyssal to create a flurry of attacks at his full dice pool directed at multiple opponents, with a total Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest values for any one attack. This attack ignores Rate. To activate this Charm, there must be one target within (Essence x 5) yards of the Abyssal, and a second target within that same distance from the first. The Abyssal vanishes into a black blur, scything through the body of his first target before moving on to the next. He may attack up to (Dexterity + 3) times in this fashion, moving up to (Essence x 5) yards between each attack to reach a new victim. Each attack must be directed at a separate target.
   Whenever the Abyssal inflicts at least one health level of damage with one of these attacks, the target's soul is caught in an icy vacuum of relentless death, their life held in abeyance for the duration of the attack. The victim becomes temporarily Inactive for the duration of the tick on which he was struck, during which time he is completely helpless to defend himself. (This Inactive state has no Speed value and does not hasten or delay the victim's next action tick).
   The victim experiences a sensation much like dying; he sees only darkness, and feels nothing but the terror of an impending doom. This "moment of death" is reversed on the next tick: the character regains his consciousness and may resume acting. Note that his recovery is not a predestined byproduct of this Charm; his return to consciousness is fully dependent on him not being slaughtered on the tick in which he goes inactive.
   Instant Murder Flash holds victims on the precipice of death by exposing them to the limitless scope of the deathknight's talent for killing. This thrall lasts only as long as the attack continues. If the Abyssal ends this attack prematurely, each victim immediately recovers from Inactive status. The Abyssal may not re-apply his damage via Charms or use free reflexive attacks on opponents made Inactive by Instant Murder Flash. Interrupting Instant Murder Flash for any reason terminates all suspension of its victims. This does not, however, prevent the Abyssal's allies from annihilating Inactive victims.</description>
        <comment>On Instant Murder Flash: "These two are a bit of a Second Edition re-imagining of one of our favorite First Edition Charms, Glorious Carnage Typhoon. While the Typhoon has moved on and become a holy terror in the War tree, it left Melee feeling a bit sad to have lost the most visually impressive trick in its repertoire. Now the death-storm returns, and brings with it a new example of jeopardy offense technology. These two were John's design, and I'm really pleased with how they turned out." -H</comment>

        <description>The deathknight's killing arts are such that he may bring on death little by little, or all at once. When the Abyssal has set three or more opponents to Inactive with Instant Murder Flash, he may pay two motes, one Willpower at the end of the flurry to unleash the Blood Press Guillotine. There is a momentary surge of nightmare forces, a flash like white lightning, and the deathknight vanishes, surging across the field in all directions to make a horrific simultaneous attack against each Inactive opponent. This attack is made at the deathknight's full dice pool and applied to all Inactive targets. It ignores range and carries (Essence) automatic successes. The Abyssal may enhance Blood Press Guillotine with offensive Charms fueled by Overdrive.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal may cast a slain spirit into Oblivion. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm does not instantly consume its target. Instead, the slain spirit lingers as a manifested but dematerialized presence for a number of ticks equal to its Essence rating. During this time, it remains inactive, but aware enough to speak a few final words or futilely beg for help as it fades away to nothingness.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal touches a spirit and blasts it with the Essence of this Charm. Successful contact throws the target back a number of yards equal to (Abyssal's Essence x 10) and knocks it prone. In addition, the Charm forces the spirit into its natural state, terminating the effects of any Materialize or Dematerialize Charms. Abyssals with Essence 5+ may "touch" spirits up to 100 yards away using an unblockable (but dodgeable) attack pool of (Charisma + Occult).</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances its prerequisite, allowing the Abyssal to steal motes with attacks against the Fair Folk and annihilate their bodies and Essence on a fatal attack, as per a spirit. Against humans, this effect only steals motes from those who have them (such as an Exalt), but obliterates their higher souls with a fatal attack, leaving flesh for reanimation and lower souls that automatically rise as hungry ghosts.
   If the Abyssal has Essence 5+, whenever a valid target dies within (Essence x 10) yards, the deathknight may activate God-Slaying Torment as an innate power rather than requiring a Charm activation in order to annihilate that being. Doing so does not provide Essence unless the Abyssal actually struck the deathblow.</description>

        <description>The Neverborn may forgo the immediate pleasure of annihilating one of the treacherous gods in order to enslave it to the cause of Oblivion. This Charm expands the capabilities of God-Slaying Torment, giving the Abyssal the option to bind a slain spirit with an unnatural Servitude effect rather than unmake it. At the moment when the spirit would fade away completely, it instead heals back to its lowest -4 health level with no Willpower points remaining and must obey its killer's orders without the possibility of resistance for a year and a day. Beings enslaved thus must obey normally unacceptable orders, but they need follow only the wording of commands and not their spirit. Storytellers should keep this clause firmly in mind as a legitimate and intended means of reigning in abuses of this Charm.
   Actual sorcerous or necromantic binding trumps this Charm and prematurely ends its effects. Enslaving a god thus violates Celestial law, though that's part of the fun for most Abyssals. Deathknights who know Oblivion Triumphant may bind slain Fair Folk as well as spirits, but they cannot bind spirits or raksha that they did not personally kill.</description>

        <description>As dead things locked in a perpetual stasis of eternal torment, the Neverborn cannot truly be said to enjoy anything. It does, however, almost please them when their servants emulate the greatest trick of the Solar Exalted on their behalf'slaying that which believed itself too mighty to be destroyed.
   Whenever the Abyssal permanently slays a living being with Essence 4+, she loses one point of Resonance (since many spirits normally reconstitute themselves after death, this generally requires execution with God-Slaying Torment). If the being possessed Essence 6+, the Abyssal loses an additional point of Resonance. If the being was a non-Abyssal Exalt, an additional point is lost. Sorcerously bound spirits grant no Resonance loss when executed.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal Exalted stand as gatekeepers between Creation and the Underworld. The deathknight can call upon this authority to make the living witnesses to the plight of the dead. To use this Charm on a character, the Abyssal must touch them. Cursed characters become attuned to the spiritual reality of the Underworld as a Shaping effect. They are capable of perceiving and interacting with dematerialized ghosts as though the dead were material - but by the same token, ghosts need not materialize to physically interact with them. In effect, the victim is simultaneously materialized and dematerialized, but only dematerialized with regard to ghosts and other things native to the Underworld (such as relic walls and weapons). Repeated activations of this Charm can tag multiple targets, costing three motes per target (one mote per extra).
   Ghosts can perceive the curse on the pariah as an Obvious aura, realizing that he is capable of interacting with them. Whether they seek him out to beg favors, demand offerings or torment him ruthlessly depends on their temperament. Ghosts with an Intimacy towards the cursed character sense the curse going into effect and remain aware that the effects is in place on the specific target across all distance and realms of existence. This gives them a chance to plan a reunion with a lost love or vendetta on an old enemy. The Abyssal can use this Charm on himself if he wishes; it is only a curse for those he wishes to torment.
       Repurchasing this Charm at Essence 4+ allows the deathknight to tag ghosts and other plasmic creatures of the Underworld for an increased cost of six motes. This doesn't function on ghosts with higher Essence than the Abyssal, such as the Deathlords. Touching the space such entities occupy is sufficient to deliver the curse when actual physical interaction is impossible (usually due to the ghost being incorporeal). Tagged ghosts exist simultaneously as materialized and dematerialized in all realms of existence, allowing them to perceive and physically interact with everything regardless of its material state. Ghosts matter less to the universe, and so they do not broadcast the curse's presence via the Intimacies of others. However, anyone who perceives them can sense the tag's effects as an Obvious effect.</description>

        <description>This Charm expands Haunting Apparition Trick. The maximum radius for evoking unnatural effects extends to (Essence x 100) yards, or (Essence - 5) miles if the Abyssal has Essence 6+. More importantly, the Exalt may use these effects to cause physical injury to living, mortal creatures within (Essence x 10) yards. The Charm causes harm through blatantly supernatural and suitably Abyssal effects. Chill winds freeze, frightful keening causes the victim to bleed from the ears and so on.
   Withering Phantasmagoria inflicts harm in three ways. The Abyssal chooses between them each time she uses the Charm. Two methods last as long as the Abyssal continues to sing, play, orate or the like, and spends Essence each action to maintain the Charm. The third is an instant attack. For each form, however, the Abyssal's player must roll (Charisma + Performance) to initiate the attack. A character gains one attack form when she learns the Charm. Additional applications cost an additional experience point each, or all three attack forms for one bonus point. A character can use only one attack form at a time. Activating the Charm costs Willpower. Continuing it merely costs Essence (for the two continuing effects).
   Area, Continuing: The Abyssal inflicts one level of lethal damage per two motes spent each action, to a maximum of (Essence) damage. Targets can soak this damage only with Stamina or soak-enhancing Charms. The Abyssal’s lethal performance affects everyone whose Dodge MDV is less than the number of successes from the attack roll. Continuing the attack counts as the character’s Charm use for each action.
   Single Target, Continuing: The Abyssal’s chosen victim suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage per action that the Abyssal continues the Charm. This effect costs three motes per action. The initial attack roll must exceed the victim’s Dodge MDV. Continuing the attack counts as the character’s Charm use for each action.
   Single Target, Instant: The Abyssal spends up to her (Stamina + Essence) in motes and inflicts that many dice of lethal damage, plus extra successes from the attack roll. The target can resist this damage only with Stamina or soak-enhancing Charms. The attack cannot be parried without a Charm or stunt, but it can be dodged like a normal ranged attack.</description>

        <description>When Abyssals come to kill you, they will find you and they will kill you. Why prolong the inevitable? Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt's player rolls (Charisma + Performance), adding the character's Essence in bonus successes. For the rest of the scene, everyone with a Dodge MDV lower than the successes rolled suffers an unnatural compulsion to remain whenever they attempt to leave or avoid any combat, mass combat or social combat in which the deathknight visibly participates. Falling back to make ranged attacks is not retreating. Resisting this compulsion for the rest of the scene costs three Willpower. Like moths to the flame, afflicted Fair Folk cannot resist. Conversely, afflicted individuals compelled to flee by a botched Morale check or some other fear-based effect must spend Willpower to escape if they have it available, but otherwise collapse in helpless terror for the duration of the effect.</description>

        <description>While terror and madness are the primary social weapons of the Abyssal Exalted, some prefer the subtler horror of unwanted desire. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm builds only Intimacies of lust toward the Abyssal and cannot build love or loyalty to the Exalt or a cause, but this Charm ignores a victim's usual sexual orientation. In addition, the first time a deathknight makes a (Manipulation + Presence)-based social attack to seduce a character with a lower Essence rating in the same scene that he gained an Intimacy of lust toward her, the attempt becomes unnatural mental influence costing three Willpower to resist. Note that a seduced character may still defend against attacks and can spend Willpower normally to shrug off a successful seduction as circumstances require, but that doesn't make an Abyssal any less desirable to those inflamed with lust toward her.</description>

        <description>Abyssal Exalted who preach the holiness of death and the veneration of the dead may lead by example, invoking ghosts with their prayers. Less scrupulous deathknights terrorize the restless dead with threatening prayers or call upon spectres from the deepest Labyrinth. This Charm enhances a standard prayer action (Exalted, p. 132) directed toward a ghost whose Essence does not exceed the Abyssal's, adding 10 successes to the roll. This bonus stacks with Excellencies without limits, though this Charm alone ensures automatic success in most cases. If the Abyssal does not know the ghost's name, she may use a descriptive stunt to make the target clear. The target not only hears a successful prayer from anywhere in existence, the Abyssal may command her to appear. Resisting this unnatural Compulsion costs one Willpower. If the ghost fails to resist, the Abyssal can spend an additional 17 motes to summon the target to her side through a vortex of moaning shadows.
   An Abyssal can also use this Charm with prayers to the Deathlords or the Neverborn, but only to ensure that the target receives the deathknight's message. How the target responds is beyond the Abyssal's control.</description>

        <description>Given their perch on the edge of the Well of Oblivion, the Neverborn spend more time anticipating the plunge into dark holes than anyone. Like any prisoner, an Abyssal trapped within a Monstrance desires freedom. For some, sexual degradation is preferable to imprisonment and slavery.
   This Performance Charm requires the Abyssal to use it within her Monstrance, whether during her initial Exaltation or by way of reentrance. She performs a dance so erotic that it ignites the deadly desires of her master's Neverborn, who tears her from the cage, slakes its sexual desires upon her and releases her for a time while it slumbers in satiation. The player of the Abyssal rolls a number of dice equal to the character's (Stamina + Performance) with a number of automatic successes equal to her Appearance. Each success inflicts one point of Resonance upon the Abyssal, with results above 10 resulting in instant venting of 10-point effects until the total is less than 10. However, each success also grants the user one single perfect resistance to a single social attack from the sex-partner Neverborn or any Deathlord or Abyssal whose allegiance is to that Neverborn. A perfect resistance allows the defender to automatically block or dodge a mental attack even if it is unblockable or undodgeable. Additional uses of the Charm do not stack; indeed trying to use this Charm before the defenses it offers are expended results in the Exalt losing all such defenses and being raped by the Neverborn target.</description>

        <description>Midnight philosophers debate whether it is more effective to destroy what someone loves or destroy the love itself. This Charm enhances any Presence based social attack aimed at eroding a positive Intimacy. If the attempt succeeds, it becomes unnatural mental influence that requires two Willpower to resist; the target's spending the Willpower prevents any further use of the Charm on that target during the scene. Absent resistance to the Charm, the Intimacy remains, but its emotional context shifts to resentment or outright hatred as chosen by the Abyssal.
   If an Abyssal has Essence 4+, he may use this Charm to attack a mortal's Motivation rather than an Intimacy. If successful, the victim's player must spend Willpower to resist (if possible) or else choose a new un-heroic Motivation for the character, though not necessarily one that is harmful. Thus might an idealistic rebel be dissuaded from his crusade into returning home and spending his days tending his farm. A heroic mortal diminished in this way becomes an extra, which also ends any hope he will attain Solar or Lunar Exaltation. The Motivations of mortals destined to become Sidereal Exalted cannot be diminished with this Charm.</description>

        <description>Those who dare refuse an Abyssal's commands suffer terribly for their impudence. Whenever a deathknight with this Charm makes a written or spoken social attack or uses a Charm that imposes unnatural mental influence, he may reflexively spend one Willpower to enhance the effect. By doing so, anyone who would spend Willpower points to resist the effect must instead pay an equivalent number of lethal health levels. Because this is a cost, this damage cannot be prevented by any effect that does not also result in the victim consenting to the attack. The Abyssal may choose whether the effect's damage occurs subtly as life-draining weakness or spectacularly in the form of unnatural stigmata.</description>

        <description>The dead know their masters, the Chosen of the Neverborn. When the Abyssal wants to seize control of zombies or other mindless creatures of death, her player rolls (Manipulation + Presence). The difficulty is the Essence of the mindless undead or the Dodge MDV of a necromancer or Abyssal who already controls the creatures. If targeting multiple entities, use the highest difficulty in the group of targets. If the roll succeeds, the targets must obey the Abyssal until the sun next rises. Being mindless, they treat all orders as acceptable though their comprehension is sadly limited. A controlled zombie, hungry ghost or the like has an effective Intelligence of 1 for understanding an Abyssal's commands.</description>

Emptying the heart carries its own dangers, however, for desolate or hate-poisoned souls open themselves to the Neverborn and their thralls.

        <description>Sometimes Abyssals don't really want to persuade anyone of anything. They just want to tear an enemy's mind into broken, gibbering shards of pain. The Abyssal makes a social attack in which her player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence) against the target's Dodge MDV. If the target can gain Limit or Resonance, every three threshold successes increase her Limit or Resonance total by one, though the target may spend two Willpower each rather than gain the points. Other targets instead lose one Willpower for every three threshold successes. Any victims reduced to zero Willpower by this Charm even those who spend their last Willpower points resisting Limit or Resonance gains suffer the effects of a Solar Limit Break selected by the Storyteller from those associated with the target's highest rated Virtue (see Exalted pp. 103-105). Mortals cannot partially control induced Limit Breaks, though other victims can.
   No matter what sort of being an Exalted or mortal victim of this Charm is, he suffers a Solar-style Limit Break if this Charm's effects (or resistance thereto) run him out of Willpower. If the victim is Exalted, this Charm's induced Limit Break wipes out any points of Limit he had before the Limit Break. Deathknights retain any points of Resonance they had, however.</description>

        <description>Abyssals are the rightful kings of the dead and masters of the realm below. Those that recognize this fact may shelter in the deathknight's shadow, protected by his fell majesty. Any ghost with an Intimacy of loyalty toward an Abyssal who knows this Charm is immune to being summoned and bound through necromancy or sorcery by any individual other than the Abyssal himself. Furthermore, any attempts to mentally influence such a ghost to betray the Abyssal or abandon her Intimacy suffer a -1 external penalty.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's presence devours light. Drawing in the very light of day, her Essence bleeds out into the world, smothering all illumination. Flames gutter, animas dim, and even sunlight dwindles within (Essence x 100) yards of the deathknight. All visibility within this range is reduced to “No moon, grass or leafless forest.” (See Exalted, p. 135) It is cold within this field of darkness; living visitors are assaulted with the chill of the grave (treat as an environmental hazard with damage 1B/minute, trauma 1). A susurrus of ghostly prayer may be faintly heard, carried on winds from the Underworld. Individuals within the Abyssal's shroud of darkness suffer a -1 external penalty on all hearing-based Awareness rolls due to this distraction. Finally, this blighted zone is considered to count as being surrounded by the trappings of death for the purpose of protecting the Abyssal from exposure to Creation. The Abyssal is immune to all negative effects of her Charm. Sunlight originating from a Holy source cuts cleanly through Hungry Darkness Prana.</description>

        <description>This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. The Abyssal's black shroud confuses the senses of those within; insubstantial touches propel visitors inward. No matter what direction a character seems to be heading in, he will find himself moving toward the center of the field of darkness-the Abyssal herself. Attempting to move away from the Abyssal or leave the shroud of darkness requires a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll once per action, at a difficulty of the Abyssal's Essence; success permits a character to move as he wills, while failure confuses him and draws him toward the Abyssal. Alternately, the victim may spend two points of Willpower to ignore this Charm's unnatural mental influence for one day.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal shapes essence into powerful armor. Depending on preference, he might grow an exoskeleton of articulated bone that tears out through his skin, he might extrude and freeze blood from every orifice into a scarlet carapace, or he might summon "normal" armor out of darkness itself. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm can also create a long flowing cape of blood or shadows in place of a shield, which moves of its own volition to entangle and deflect attacks. Although this effect allows the Abyssal to use two-handed weapons, the cape offers only +1 DV (close)/+1 DV (ranged) protection and is not cumulative with other cover, including conventional shields. Abyssal sometimes call the bone armor the Ivory Blossom Carapace, while the blood-wrought panoply is Crimson Petal Armor.</description>

        <description>Death has no power over those who have cheated its clutches. The Abyssal activates this Charm immediately before damage is rolled against her. All damage appears to apply normally, seemingly wounding or even slaying the Abyssal - which is appropriately spectacular when he falls from a great height or stands in the path of Solar Circle sorcery. His injuries are a lie, however, as the Abyssal heals back all of this "damage" in less than a second. The net result is that the Abyssal perfectly defends against all damage from the attack.
   This Charm carries one of the Four Flaws of Abyssal Invulnerability.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal transcends the need for sleep and experiences reality as a particularly lucid nightmare. While this Charm is active, he suffers no adverse effects from sleep deprivation besides the lost opportunity for Willpower recovery. A character can use this Charm to go without sleep for (Stamina + Resistance) days. After that, he suffers one level of unsoakable bashing damage per day without sleep, which he must heal through rest before he can activate the Charm again.
   An Abyssal can also make the Charm permanent as a Taint and never sleep again. He won't take damage, but he forever cuts himself off from the benefits of sleep. Doing so costs one bonus point or two experience points.</description>

        <description>The deathknight feels hunger as mild discomfort rather than a debilitating and ultimately fatal condition. While this Charm is active, the total penalty for starvation and/or thirst never exceeds -1. The Taint drawback to making this Charm permanent is that the Abyssal becomes incapable of eating except when he devours others for Essence. After eating any other food, his player rolls (Stamina + Resistance) each minute with the difficulty equal to the minutes that passed since the character's first bite. Failure causes the deathknight to vomit the contents of his stomach. The Taint costs two bonus points or four experience points.</description>

        <description>Is a defeated Abyssal actually dead? The Exalt gains a number of extra Incapacitated health levels equal to his current Stamina. In addition, his vital signs all but stop while he's Incapacitated, giving him benefits comparable to Plague Knows Its Master (see p. 149), Corpse Needs No Food and Breathless Ghost Emulation and making him appear dead to all examination. If a Charm opposes this effect, add the Abyssal's Essence rating in bonus successes to the contested roll. Deathknights cannot purchase this Charm more times than they have dots of Resistance.
   Abyssals with Essence 3+ may suspend their vitals as a diceless miscellaneous action without actually reducing themselves to Incapacitated, though they become equally immobile and insensate. When entering this state, the Abyssal's player must specify what conditions will reflexively awaken the character, but any triggers other than a fixed passage of time must be events that the Abyssal could sense if he were awake.</description>

        <description>Although their Exaltation protects them from non-magical diseases, magical ailments or poison can still fell Abyssals. Not so for those who wield this Charm. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm may either block Sickness effects or render the Abyssal immune to their negative effects, as selected by the Exalt's player. Choosing the latter helps the deathknight catch and spread plagues without risk to herself. This Charm always negates poison completely.</description>

        <description>The invincibility of the Abyssal Exalted is sufficient to drive heroes to despair. While this Charm is active, whenever an opponent strikes the Abyssal but fails to successfully roll any damage against him they are automatically subjected to an unnatural Emotion effect which fills them with a sense of utter hopelessness. This lassitude inflicts a -3 internal penalty to all aggressive actions directed against the Abyssal for the rest of the scene. Opponents may resist this despair for a scene by paying three points of Willpower.
   As a point of clarification, in order for this Charm to trigger, opponents must roll at least one die of damage and gain no successes - this Charm will not trigger if the Abyssal uses a Charm to reduce damage to 0 or to ensure that no damage could possibly be inflicted, such as with Wounds Mean Nothing.
   If the Abyssal has Essence 4+, opponents who fail to damage her a second time while already suffering from despair inflicted by Hope-Slaying Resilience automatically gain an Intimacy of fear against the deathknight. This unnatural mental influence may be resisted by paying one point of Willpower.</description>

            <description>Necrotic Essence permeates throughout the Abyssal's body, stripping away the weaknesses of living flesh. His skin hardens to living ivory, and his bones are as unbreakable steel. All attacks against the Abyssal have their minimum damage reduced by one die for the duration of this Charm unless they deal aggravated damage.
   Against any attack that would reduce him to Incapacitated or worse while Hideous Husk Technique is active, it prevents all damage that would go past his -4 health level, allowing him to shrug off even the most gruesomely fatal wounds. This desperate defense is Obvious, and ends the duration of this Charm prematurely. It can only trigger once per scene; subsequent incapacitating attacks will affect the Abyssal normally.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's body goes horrifically limp as he is struck, bending and distorting under the force of the blow far more than any flesh or bone should be able to. His foes can only gape in shocked silence as they witness him laughing off his unbleeding wounds, or popping dislocated limbs back into place. Every mote spent on this Charm removes one die from the post-soak damage of an attack against the Abyssal, to a minimum of one die.
   The attacking character gains an Intimacy of fear towards the Abyssal if they have a Dodge MDV lower than the number of motes spent on this defense, as they realize the true nature of the undying horror they face. Resisting this unnatural Emotion effect costs one Willpower.</description>

        <description>The Deathknight physically and mentally tames a natural or undead animal large enough to bear her, supernaturally breaking its will to better suit her needs. If the Exalt is already riding the animal when he activates this Charm, it requires no activation roll. If, however, the Abyssal wishes to leap astride an animal that does not wish to be ridden and the Abyssal is within a number of yards of the target equal to her Ride score, her player must roll a special physical "attack" first. This "attack" uses (Dexterity + Ride) at a difficulty equal to the animal's natural Control Rating (see Exalted, p. 154). A successful hit inflicts no damage but grants dominion over the new mount.
   A beast enchanted by Soul Reins becomes a creature of darkness and ceases to need Virtues as per the walking dead. It is Control 1 when ridden by its master and moves as an extension of her will, preventing her from falling off unintentionally. Within the realms of the dead, the steed always knows its master's location relative to its own (unless the master is in an area warded from scrying) and must make its way to her side at best possible speed whenever the master wishes it to do so. Each use of this Charm on a natural animal permanently increases its Control rating by one (maximum 6). This effect does not affect the Charm's difficulty. Each month of care and gentle retraining reduces the rating by one until the animal's behavior returns to normal.</description>

On the other hand, they are not loyal beyond the degree to which their rider can control them.</description>

Wretched Ridden Nightmare grants one blight, one affliction and two poxes selected by the Abyssal when he activates the Charm, as well making the steed a creature of darkness. All of these mutations must directly improve the animal's utility as a mount or increase its physical combat power. The Storyteller may veto any mutations that do not conform to the strictures and intent of this Charm.

        <description>The Abyssal captain invokes and journeys on secret currents created by the Primordials for their own use. A Deathknight may activate this Charm only aboard a ship he owns. Its effects last until he leaves the ship or the light of Creation's sun touches the hull.
   A vessel enchanted with Dark Water Odyssey travels at twice its maximum speed without any need for usual propulsion methods, carried along by unnatural currents that leave no wake or sign of the ship's passage. The total absence of a trail results in automatic failure for would-be trackers and adds a number of automatic successes equal to the Abyssal's Essence rating if another Charm contests this effect. Finally, the ship and all aboard are also outside fate while journeying thus. Used aboard an aerial vessel, this Charm does not replace the need for propulsion, but doubles the speed of the craft and obscures its passage.</description>

        <description>Once an Abyssal masters this Charm, ships he command function at full efficiency and with no penalties, even with crew complements as low as a skeleton crew. In addition, each scene the deathknight spends commanding his crew counts as a scene of building an Intimacy of submissive fear in them unless they have an Essence rating equal to or greater than his own. Those who develop such Intimacies cannot take any actions that would knowingly result in harm to their captain or remove him from his position while aboard a ship he owns, unless they spend two Willpower points per day to overcome the unnatural mental influence of this Charm.</description>

        <description>The sea holds many dangers, especially for champions of Oblivion. Prudent captains keep a close eye on the waves and horizon, watching for any trace of an enemy's approach. An Abyssal can activate this Charm only aboard a ship he owns; it ends when he leaves the ship for any reason. While active, the Exalt ignores all visibility limitations or other penalties that would inhibit his ability to navigate. He also becomes preternaturally aware of his environment out to a distance of (Sail x 10) miles.
   Through this Charm's awareness, the Exalt perfectly understands all weather conditions and mentally maps all terrain that is not magically obscured from scrying. He can spot reefs and other hazards long before they threaten his ship, not to mention noticing distant coasts before his lookouts do. His awareness lets him pinpoint other ships of seaworthy size. He also senses comparably large animals such as whales and siaka unless they are magically hidden in some way, though the Charm alone only reveals the size, speed and bearing of these objects. Used aboard an aerial vessel, this Charm maps terrain and tracks other aerial vehicles or animals of suitable size.</description>

        <description>Tendrils of dense fog swirl around the Abyssal's ship, rapidly thickening and spreading into a windless cloud with a radius in miles equal to the Abyssal's Sail rating. The deathknight can center the cloud anywhere as long as her ship stays somewhere inside. Clouds created by this Charm last for one scene before they disperse. Their maker cannot prematurely dismiss the clouds since they are not sustained by committed Essence. Although multiple clouds can join together to blanket a larger area, their effects do not stack with overlap; only the greatest penalties apply.
   No one could mistake the magical fog for natural weather. The fog imposes a variety of effects on all within it, including its creator:
• Visibility drops to five yards for clear vision and 15 yards for murky vision, providing plenty of concealment to hide naval units.
• Navigation rolls within the cloud suffer a -3 external penalty on top of penalties for poor visibility. Failure always leads the navigator deeper into the cloud rather than out of it.
• The fog magically filters sunlight to protect creatures and effects harmed by this illumination.
• No wind naturally blows in the cloud, leaving wind-powered vessels dead in the water unless they can break out oars. Magical wind trumps this aspect of the Charm but does not dissolve the cloud unless the source has a higher Essence rating than the Abyssal.</description>

        <description>This terrifying Charm blurs the barrier between the worlds of the living and the dead, enabling powerful death-knights to sail between the two. At night, either in Creation or the Underworld, the Abyssal evokes a fogbank with all the properties of Mist-Veiled Doldrums Technique, though only (Essence x 100) yards in radius. The focused fog simultane-ously appears in the analogous location in the other world. Anyone can recognize its spectral character with a difficulty 3 (Intelligence + [Occult or Sail] + Essence) roll. Anything that enters the fog from the Underworld leaves the fog in Creation, and vice versa. Those who do not make their way out of the cloud before it evaporates remain in the world from which they entered.
   Although the effects of this Charm resemble a shadowland, the fog is not actually considered such. While rifts created by Shroud-Crossing Miasma set off detection alarms at the Bureau of Destiny and the central controls of the Realm Defense Grid, Heaven lacks the resources or inclination to investigate most incursions outside of a few favored locations.</description>

        <description>Abyssal captains brutalize their ships worse than they do their crew. This Charm grants ownership of any Sail-based vehicle that is not currently owned by another Essence user, infecting it with unholy Essence. As Unhallowed Ghost Ship activates, the ship's least god manifests on deck and screams in confused agony before the Charm permanently destroys her. Thereafter, the godless ship looks substantially more weathered and damaged than it really is. The ship imposes a -1 external penalty to all non-reflexive actions taken onboard by anyone who is not a creature of death. A ship cursed thus must always remain so. Without a god, it cannot have its ownership transferred. Wise enemies sink these vessels rather than invite catastrophe by attempting to capture them.</description>

        <description>While active, the Abyssal intuitively knows the location of all ships he's personally claimed with Unhallowed Ghost Ship within (Essence rating) miles and can issue reflexive telepathic orders to any or all of them, though this communication is still language dependent. All onboard the vessel hear the words in their mind as if the Abyssal were speaking from just behind them, allowing the ship to carry out orders from afar without distracting the captain from other tasks. Additionally, no relays are needed to prevent communication failure for units composed of crewmembers listening to these orders, leaving room for additional special characters.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal poisons a speaker's words with Essence, inducing her to commit a critical faux pas or shameful lapse of expected social graces. A deathknight can use this Charm to target any social attack she witnesses, inflicting a -1 external penalty for every three motes spent. Whenever a social attack targeted by this Charm fails, the targeted attacker suffers a -1 external penalty on all subsequent social attacks for the rest of the scene against anyone who observed his failure. No combination of instant or lingering effects from this Charm can penalize a social attack by more successes than the Abyssal has dots of Socialize.
   Without some way of detecting this Charm at work, no observer can discern any connection between the Abyssal and the effects of this Charm, though suspicion might grow if the deathknight is always present when his political rivals just happen to slip up. Proving such suspicions is another matter altogether.</description>

        <description>Moonshadows liken the act of murder to a night with a cheap whore. It will do, but it lacks romance or mean-ing. The destruction of an enemy should involve the slow seduction of shattered dreams and broken hopes as foreplay to the final release of the killing blow. The Abyssal spends a scene interacting with the target or someone toward whom the target has a positive Intimacy. The deathknight's player rolls (Manipulation + Socialize), adding a number of bonus successes equal to the character's Essence rating and applying an external penalty equal to the target's Essence rating.
   For as long as this Charm remains active, the target carries an unnatural Compulsion effect that reaches out to infect those toward whom he holds a positive Intimacy whenever he interacts with them. If the number of successes rolled for this Charm exceeds such a loved one's Dodge MDV, that character must betray the target at the first opportunity.
   Upon using this Charm, the Abyssal specifies whether it induces violent or nonviolent betrayal. In the former case, the betrayal takes the form of combat initiated with the best unexpected attack available to the character. The betrayer uses the most deadly attacks available to her and attacks without mercy. Nonviolent betrayal involves whatever course of action the target would find most emotionally hurtful and damaging to the target's Intimacy toward the attacker. In either case, loved ones may abort their treachery at any point and come to their senses by paying one Willpower point. The Illusion effect of this Charm, however, makes them believe their betrayal was entirely their own mad impulse unless they pay three Willpower points instead.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances any Manipulation-based social attack against a social unit aimed at stirring up infighting and chaos within the organization. It is explicitly permitted to supplement actions using other Abilities. Through the power of Cancerous Dissent Technique, the Abyssal's attack does not require any direct contact with the organization's leader. Instead, the deathknight conveys the attack to any unit member and waits for the seeds of dissatisfaction and unrest to work their way up through the social structure. Step Two of attack resolution does not occur until a number of days pass equal to the unit's Magnitude, preventing anyone from connecting the attack to the Abyssal without a thorough investigation that has a base difficulty equal to the Abyssal's (Socialize + Essence). Rather than attempt to change the unit's Policy, the unnatural Emotion effect of this attack tears the organization apart from within, draining one Loyalty point for every two successes by which it exceeds the unit leader's Dodge MDV.</description>

        <description>The Deathknight taps into the hate and resentment that compelled him to accept Abyssal Exaltation, infusing his words with supernatural malice. While he keeps this Charm active, any attempt he makes to build a negative Intimacy or tear down a positive Intimacy with a natural social attack becomes unnatural mental influence that costs one Willpower point to resist. Once a character spends five Willpower points in a scene from resisting such attacks, that character becomes immune to all further attacks for the rest of the day. Failure to resist means the Intimacy forms or dissolves immediately as an Emotion effect rather than requiring the usual repeated effort.
       Mortals who gain a negative Intimacy thus also suffer an unnatural Compulsion effect that lasts past the duration of the Charm until the Intimacy erodes completely. This effect comes into play whenever anyone attempts to weaken the Intimacy with a social attack. The mortal must immediately retaliate against the speaker with physical violence unless she pays one Willpower point to resist the violent urge. Mortals maddened by such passions will even attack the Abyssal if he tries to douse the flames of hate his Charm ignited.</description>

        <description>Acting with the authority of the murdered architects of the universe, the Abyssal hands down binding commandments that a society must follow. These are the Old Laws, small excerpts of an infinite litany of denial which rolls through the black dreams of the Neverborn. This Charm is similar to Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe (see Exalted, p. 238), save that it does not create a taboo or fad, but a law. The Abyssal's Socialize roll suffers a -1 external penalty if the majority of the targeted social group's members are alive, and a separate -3 external penalty if the Old Law he hands down has nothing to do with death or the dead.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal becomes a warden of the Old Laws, gaining an infallible sense that informs him when an individual breaks an Old Law he has laid down with this Charm's prerequisite. He knows when and where the law has been broken, but not by whom. He enjoys one automatic success on all attempts to investigate the violation and determine the identity of the lawbreaker.
   Should the Abyssal successfully uncover the lawbreaker and punish her, he loses one point of Resonance. Fitting punishment includes execution, destruction of a ghost's Fetters or the subject of one of its Passions, or sacrifice of a living individual's property to the dead sufficient to drop the individual a Resources dot (for example, if a wealthy merchant worth Resources 4 violated one of the Old Laws, the Abyssal might turn his fine home into a burnt offering to the merchant's ancestors, reducing the lawbreaker to Resources 3 and setting him off on the road with only his wagon and goods to attempt to rebuild his fortune).</description>

        <description>It is not merely the judgment of the Unconquered Sun that makes Abyssals creatures of darkness. Shadows are their element, hiding them from their prey until it's too late. Purchasing this Charm gives Abyssals an artificial +3 specialty "In Darkness" for Stealth, though this bonus is not cumulative with normal specialties. Furthermore, whenever this artificial specialty applies to an action, Shadow Cloak Technique also doubles all bonus dice and/or successes received from stunts or Stealth Excellencies, although Excellency use remains capped by the usual limits for bonuses added by Charms.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal blurs and fades into the darkness between the strands of the Tapestry, outside fate and completely invisible except to those who share her insight into the Neverborn's madness (i.e., those with a Whispers rating). This invisibility imposes a -2 external penalty to any attempt to notice or attack her. Ranged attacks against her become impossible (she is not a valid target) without the aid of magic or a stunt. The bonus adds two successes to contested Stealth rolls to avoid notice instead of adding to the onlooker's difficulty (such as when reestablishing surprise).
   As an additional benefit, the Abyssal is outside fate for purposes of Sidereal astrology. While the Charm lasts, the deathknight cannot be found on the Loom of Fate, astrological blessings and curses do not affect her, and she sees through the false identities created through resplendent destinies.
   It is still possible for the Abyssal to be detected, making effective Stealth rolls as important as ever. The fact that the Abyssal may use that Stealth even in the absence of cover or concealment, however, provides a significant tactical opportunity for repeatedly setting up unexpected attacks.</description>

        <description>An Abyssal veiled by this Charm is a walking nightmare. He should not exist, so he does not exist. No screams or pleas for help from nameless strangers can convince bystanders otherwise. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt's player rolls (Manipulation + Stealth), adding successes equal to his Essence rating. Observers with a Dodge MDV less than the number of rolled successes feel an unnatural compulsion to ignore the Abyssal and any combat in which he participates. Resisting this compulsion for the rest of the scene costs two Willpower, but if a witness does so while the Abyssal can perceive her, he immediately knows that she has chosen to involve herself. (The Willpower cost drops to one point if someone else calls a witness's attention to the Abyssal). The compulsion also immediately ends without alerting the deathknight if he directly interacts with a bystander in any way or if the events of a battle physically affect that witness.
    Bystanders compelled by this Charm to ignore events bury the real memories deep in their psyche and do not attempt to correct their recollection without external prompting and a personally compelling reason. Even then, they must spend four Willpower points to confront the sickening truth that they could have done something and chose not to.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal Exalted almost pity those who huddle in the light, believing themselves safe while failing to notice the darkness always trailing at their heels. This Charm may only be activated while the Abyssal is concealed from the notice of all present beings. Unseen, he steps onto the shadow of another character and spend four motes to sink into its depths.
   So long as the Abyssal commits motes to this Charm, he may ride along inside of a character's shadow, watching the world while remaining utterly unseen. In this manner a deathknight may infiltrate the most secure fortresses in Creation, or even breach Heaven itself, carried in the shadow of those who have every right to be there. If the Abyssal chooses to terminate his concealment by launching an unexpected attack at the character whose shadow he is riding, he adds three automatic successes to his attack roll. If the Abyssal is spotted hiding within a shadow by some means, he may be targeted normally by striking at the shadow.
   A second purchase of this Charm permits the Abyssal to take small, surreptitious actions while riding in a shadow. Directly attacking other characters or doing anything so loud or overtly obvious as to draw notice breaks the Charm, but Larceny actions to pick pockets or steal small objects are usually valid, as might be other stealthy actions at the Storyteller's discretion (such as tipping a drop of poison into a drinking cup). The Abyssal temporarily hijacks his host's shadow while performing such actions; all characters present may make a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll against a difficulty of the Abyssal's Stealth rating to notice the unnatural movements of the ridden shadow.</description>

        <description>Following an Abyssal can become an exercise in futility, or a lethal mistake. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm cannot conceal a group's passage, but it costs only five motes to activate and has the Spectral keyword. In addition, if use of this Charm allows the Abyssal to slip away, he may instead double back to ambush his pursuers. Doing so adds a number of bonus successes equal to his Survival rating to any Stealth roll against the trackers until the end of the scene or until they notice him, whichever comes first.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal's presence terrifies natural animals, evoking ancestral fear of the Primordials who once walked Creation. This Charm projects an unnatural Compulsion within a radius of (Essence x 2) yards, forcing natural animals to flee the zone of terror. Resistance is not possible, but animals that are cornered or otherwise cannot flee attack the Abyssal out of instinctual desperation. Superior Predator Style has no effect on animals that are magically compelled by other effects or supernaturally loyal, such as familiars. This Charm may be activated while the character is inactive. The Taint drawback to this Charm is its own effects, since a constant fear aura does not differentiate between hostile and useful animals. The Taint costs six bonus points or 12 experience points.</description>

        <description>The ghostly familiars of the Abyssal Exalted make excellent spies in Creation, but their incorporeal state severely limits the tasks they can perform. By touching his familiar and reflexively spending 10 motes, a deathknight can force it into a materialized state for a day. She can return the creature to its natural state with another touch. It is possible to "touch" currently incorporeal beings with this Charm by reaching into the space they inhabit.
   In addition to these effects, an Abyssal with this Charm who lacks a familiar may claim one whenever he kills a natural animal by reflexively paying a number of experience points equal to the number of dots the slain animal would be worth as a familiar. Doing so rips the animal's soul out and binds it to the Abyssal, after which it regenerates within his shadow as normal.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal lies down in some traditional posture of burial, and sinks into the ground without disturbing the surface. She sleeps either for as long as she chooses or until the sun next rises. While buried, she does not need to breathe. When the time she chose is up, she rises from the ground as tracelessly as she interred herself. If the Abyssal is somehow injured or disturbed in her self-imposed burial, she erupts from the surface in a shower of earth, instantly awake.</description>

        <description>Though some of their brethren might find such practices distasteful, practical Abyssals may learn to renew themselves from even the crudest aspects of death. This Charm permanently alters the Abyssal's feeding capabilities (see The Manual of Exalted Power-The Abyssals, p. 95), permitting the deathknight to gain Essence by devouring inanimate human corpses. Devouring a single mote's worth of flesh requires a Speed 5, DV -2 miscellaneous action; only one such action may be placed in a flurry. Once the character has gained her (Stamina + Essence) motes in this manner she must wait a full day to digest before this limit resets and she may feed again. A relatively intact, adult cadaver is worth three motes of Essence, and usually runs dry of Essence long before the deathknight has consumed all of its flesh; as a result, most cadavers are still suitable for reanimation even after serving as fodder through this Charm.</description>

        <description>The viands of the dead and the meat of spectral beasts do little to sustain living mortals, though the Abyssal Exalted and other Essence-users have no difficulty surviving on such pale repast. Still, it is unseemly for a deathknight's guests to starve to death because of their host's ill-preparedness. This Charm constitutes an attempt to forage for food in the Underworld, automatically accumulating enough food to sustain a unit with a magnitude no greater than the Abyssal's Essence for a day. Alternately, it may be activated to prepare a meal of already-located food, in which case the Charm's type becomes Simple (One dramatic action), encompassing the meal's preparation time. This Charm may only be used in the Underworld and in shadowlands; it will not function in Creation, nor on food originating in Creation.
   Food located or prepared with this Charm is fully nourishing to both the living and the dead. Moreover, each meal of such food counts as a scene spent building an Intimacy of fascination toward the Underworld and a second Intimacy toward the Abyssal who provided the repast. This Intimacy may be of awe, fear, or respect - whichever is most appropriate to the situation. Should characters who partake of a meal possess conflicting Intimacies, the meal counts as a scene of work toward eroding those Intimacies. Should the Abyssal consume his own prepared meals, he gains no Intimacies; the food is simply more enjoyable, flavored with a bittersweet mixture of life and death in perfect equilibrium.
   With Essence 3+, the Abyssal's repast becomes more potent. This enhancement is non-optional. Mortals who spend a fortnight eating nothing but the food of the dead enchanted by this Charm become permanently able to consume the fare of the Underworld… and just as permanently unable to draw sustenance from any food originating in the living world, save for human flesh (food originating in shadowlands counts as food of the underworld for this purpose). This change is a Shaping effect, and attempts to reverse the condition treat it as a Wyld mutation.</description>

        <description>The cold fires of the Underworld fascinate even as they terrify. Flaring his anima into a vast constellation of cold, winking blue flames that surges a mile into the air, the light of the Abyssal's display shines through all obstructions and may be dimly glimpsed from up to (Essence) miles away, or up to (Essence x 5) miles away by a certain class of individuals the Abyssal defines at the time of this Charm's activation. Possible examples might include "Tya", "Yozi cultists", "citizens of Nexus", "Lookshy helots", or "the wealthy", with the last example being articulated by the Abyssal in those terms, and by the Abyssal's player as "characters with Resources rated four or higher".
   The Abyssal's player rolls (Manipulation + Survival + Essence). Those who see the Abyssal's beacon and whose Dodge MDVs are lower than her successes suffer an unnatural Compulsion to seek out the source of the light, which may be resisted by paying two points of Willpower. Those who see the lights and attempt to navigate toward them automatically succeed, regardless of whether they are compelled to do so.
   At Survival 6+, Essence 6+ the Charm may be activated for a cost of ten motes to send the beacon burning even higher into the sky, extending the range of its visibility for those specified to (Essence x 50) miles.
   Astrology used within the range of the lights returns only the message "THE VOID HUNGERS".</description>

        <description>Once released the Abyssal's weapon scythes from target to target in a path of destruction. This Charm is a magical flurry of up to (Thrown) attacks with no multiple-action penalties, all of which must be aimed at targets within the weapon's range. Because the attacks all use a single Thrown weapon, the flurry ignores the weapon's Rate and has a DV penalty of the highest penalty for any attack. This Charm is particularly spectacular in conjunction with Crypt Bolt Attack (see p. 134), firing chain lightning or summoning tentacles of obscene energy that twist and arc from victim to victim.</description>

        <description>Once an Abyssal with this charm picks up a small object, it becomes a deadly weapon ready to serve her murderous will. Common improvised projectiles include playing cards, pebbles, coins, origami animals, flowers and prayer strips. Improvised projectiles have Speed 5, Accuracy -2, Damage +0L, Rate 3 and Range 10. Besides making sure the Abyssal is nearly always armed, this Charm grants another benefit. Throwing a weapon provided by this Charm negates the usual +2 difficulty for making a surprise attack in plain view unless a target stays on guard because he already knows the Abyssal can turn anything into a weapon.</description>

        <description>The momentary pleasure of murder is nothing compared to a lifetime of savoring a victim's terror and agony. An Abyssal who knows this Charm can reflexively enhance any Thrown attack that inflicted at least one level of damage by committing two motes to the attack. Doing so dissolves the Essence of the deathknight's weapon into the point of impact so it appears to physically crawl through the skin the process does not wake sleeping victims, though. The dissolved attack does not inflict any damage or other effects during Step Ten of attack resolution. Instead, the doom waits in abeyance for the deathknight to terminate the commitment from anywhere in existence with a diceless miscellaneous action In so doing, he can either harmlessly give pardon or apply the delayed effects in full. Wounds inflicted this way manifest in whatever gruesome manner the Abyssal finds instructive and/or poetically appropriate, using the damage the player rolled at the time of attack.
    Even the Abyssal's death does not end the curse, leaving it to the Neverborn to decide when they wish to inflict the damage. Multiple uses of this Charm on the same victim track separately, and only the last attack in a flurry may be deferred. Mundane medicine cannot cure the Crippling curse of a Burrowing Bone Maggot.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances any Thrown attack so that it appears to graze its target with only superficial injury. If the attack hits, however, it applies one or more of the effects and all associated keywords listed here regardless of damage. The Abyssal learns one of these powers along with the initial purchase of Wicked Darts of Suffering and may broaden his repertoire by spending one experience point per power (or two for a bonus point).
   Corrosion: Eating into a target like acid, the attack inflicts double its raw damage against inanimate objects and inflicts minimum damage even if it fails to penetrate an object's Hardness. This power also unravels the Essence of Wyld creatures with similarly caustic and brutal results.
   Destruction: The attack kills any mortal or natural animal extra it hits as a Shaping and Avatar (1) effect, typically inflicting death in a horrific manner incongruous to the attack itself. If the Abyssal has Essence 4+, the attack slays non-extras and spiritually wounds Essence-users by consuming a selected Virtue channel in addition to inflicting usual physical injuries.
   Infection: The attack automatically infects a living target as a Sickness effect rather than inflicting any actual damage, as if the target failed a Virulence check. The infection's Morbidity (treated and untreated) also starts at the Abyssal's Essence rating and increases normally. Mortal extras infected thus immediately succumb to fever and begin dying, though they can be saved normally with magical treatment.
       Pain: The attack inflicts excruciating pain to animate victims as a Crippling effect, doubling the raw damage of the attack and making that damage bashing. Victims add their Essence rating to their soak against this pain and cannot be reduced below Incapacitated from such an attack.</description>

        <description>The abyssal makes one thrown based attack as part of activating this Charm, infusing the projectile with the life-draining chill of Oblivion for a cost of three motes and one Willpower. A target hit by this attack suffers no damage. Instead, the glittering Essence of the attack spreads over the target to encase her in unnatural ice with bashing and lethal soak equal to the attack's raw damage. This structure can cover any target that could fit in a sphere with a radius equal to the deathknight's Essence rating in yards. The ice is treated as an inanimate object, instantly shattering if any raw damage exceeds its soak and inflicting the attack's minimum damage on the victim in the process. Breaking out with a feat of strength requires a miscellaneous action and a (Strength + Athletics) total of the encasement's soak rating.
       Victims frozen by this Charm suffer the same impairment as characters held in a grapple but remain conscious and can take actions within these limits. The magic of the Charm prevents victims from suffocating, but the lifedraining ice injures them on initial exposure and thereafter as an environmental hazard with a trauma equal to the Abyssal's Essence rating and a damage of one bashing health level per action. Victims also lose one mote for every level of damage suffered. Unconscious victims fall into a nightmare-wracked coma and do not suffer any further damage, so the Charm is a reasonably safe way of freezing someone to Incapacitated and keeping him there for capture or transport. Whether as a result of damage or the Abyssal terminating its effects, ending this Charm restores the victim to immediate consciousness and defensive readiness.
   Separate activations of Frozen Prayer Entombment can simultaneously freeze different victims, but the Charm cannot trap an opponent in multiple layers of ice. A character can also use the freezing energy at a reduced cost of three motes to create blocks of ice up to the permitted radius. The Abyssal can use the ice for utilitarian purposes such as raw materials for Craft (Earth) actions, cover in combat, sealing off a doorway or making a crude raft.</description>

        <description>With this charm an abyssal can swat incoming projectiles out of the air like harmless insects. Lightning Clutch of the Raptor perfectly parries any ranged attack regardless of whether it is blockable, provided the Abyssal has a hand free to catch the projectile. Parrying an area attack thus stops the attack from hitting the Abyssal, but not any other targets caught in the path of destruction. If the projectile has physical substance (such as an arrow or thrown weapon), the Abyssal catches it and may reflexively toss it aside or wield it for her own attacks. Energy-based attacks or those lacking actual substance (such as a firewand blast) dissolve as the Abyssal closes her fist to smother them on impact.
   Whenever an Abyssal with Essence 4+ uses this Charm to catch and hold a Thrown weapon, she also gains a normal Thrown counterattack with the stolen weapon in Step Nine of attack resolution.</description>

        <description>Unnatural entropic and corpse-element energies crackle like ball lightning around one or both hands of the Abyssal's hands. Like an iconic anima, each user of this Charm creates a unique and easily recognizable manifestation of Essence. If an Abyssal makes an unarmed punch with a hand wreathed in Crypt Bolt Attack, the punch inflicts lethal damage. It is far more effective for him to throw part of this energy as a blast or beam, using the nimbus as a source of infinite ammunition while the Charm lasts.
   These blasts have the following traits: Speed 5, Accuracy +0, Rate 2 (one per hand), Range (Thrown x 10 yards) and inflict a base damage of (Essence x 2)L without adding Strength. This Charm inflicts damage through accelerated decay, corrosion or some other consumptive principle. There is no mistaking these wounds for natural injuries.
   Using a hand holding a Crypt Bolt Attack for anything other than throwing blasts, punching or making unarmed parries dissipates the energies, requiring the Abyssal to activate the Charm again.</description>

        <description>This Charm taps into the limitless necrotic Essence of the Neverborn's malevolence, adding the Abyssal's Whispers rating to the Accuracy and Damage of blasts from her Crypt Bolt Attack. These attacks also inflict aggravated damage to any target the Abyssal individually hates as an Intimacy. As a final benefit, the deathknight can ignite her eyes in addition to or in place of her hands, allowing her to wield other weapons. Abyssals throw murderous stares with Manipulation instead of Dexterity, but the attacks otherwise use the same rules.</description>

Failing to throw a Crypt Bolt Attack blast with the Abyssal's next action wastes the benefits of this Charm.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal speaks to the corpses around her with calm and unquestionable authority, commanding them to awaken and make war upon the living. This Charm rips out a fragment of the Abyssal's own life force as part of its cost, distributing this animating energy among the nearest corpses within a radius of (War x 100) yards. These bodies claw their way out of the earth to form an unordered unit of zombie extras under the Abyssal's command, like a unit provided by purchasing an Abyssal Command with a rating equal to the Exalt's Essence (maximum of Abyssal Command 5, see pp. 97-98). If the Abyssal abandons this unit for more than 15 long ticks or the Charm ends, the zombies collectively sigh and collapse back to lifelessness.
   Abyssals may instead use this Charm as an Avatar (3) effect to summon an equivalent Abyssal Command of hungry ghost extras from the Labyrinth instead of raising zombies. These shades have Whispers 1 and cannot appear during the day. They automatically fade back to their lightless warrens just before dawn to avoid destruction. They similarly vanish if abandoned or the Charm ends.</description>

        <description>Abyssal warlords may command as champions of Oblivion units composed of creatures of Death as extensions of their own malice. Valid units enhanced by this Charm understand the deathknight's will implicitly and cannot suffer communication failure, which obviates the need for relays and opens additional special character slots for heroes or sorcerers. Such units also have their Drill raised to a level equal to their commander's Essence rating (if that would provide an increase), to a maximum of Drill 5. Unfortunately, this micromanaged control makes units entirely dependent on their commander for guidance. Should the Abyssal perish while this Charm is active, the unit makes an immediate difficulty 6 rout check. Even units with perfect morale must make this check as if they had Morale 5.</description>

        <description>Legions fall like scythed grass before the abyssal's attack. Glorious Carnage Typhoon can enhance any attack against a Magnitude 3+ complementary unit, provided the Abyssal fights as a solo unit. This Charm negates the DV bonus for the target's superior Magnitude and doubles the raw damage of the attack (or triples damage against units arranged in close formation). If the target unit loses Magnitude as a result of the deathknight's attack, all members lost this way die rather than escaping. This effect does not affect the resolution of damage against the unit but prevents remnants from being gathered together as reinforcements by any rally action later in the scene. </description>

        <description>Any who fight in common hate may serve the cause of Oblivion whether they intend to or not, and the generals of the Neverborn know the location and condition of such forces. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm does not sense mass combat units based on loyalty, but rather detects those who take the field in common enmity, either in shared hatred of a specific foe or in a broader crusade of violence. This automatically includes all creatures of Death. An Abyssal who has Whispers 3 can also sense units made of any creatures of darkness, as the judgment of the Unconquered Sun unites them all in shared hatred of the light.</description>

        <description>This Charm takes raw recruits and brutally transforms them into incarnate weapons. Units composed of ghosts or the walking dead take twice as long to train as living troops, encouraging Abyssals to train prospective war ghosts prior to their final promotion.
   Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm cannot train Valor and badly damages the psyches of those it teaches. Each week of training poisons the positive Intimacy that most distracts the trainee from his education (assuming any exist), shifting the emotional context of that Intimacy to contempt or hatred.</description>

        <description>The most ardent disciples of darkness reap the greatest rewards of service, though these rewards are dubious at best. Unlike its Solar Mirror, this Charm cannot confer bonus dice. Instead, mortals and ghosts may be taught to reject the remaining vestiges of their humanity as an unnatural Compulsion effect (costing trainees no bonus or experience points). These wretched monsters become creatures of darkness, automatically fail all Compassion rolls and cannot form new positive Intimacies. In exchange, they become immune to wound penalties until Incapacitated and automatically succeed on all Valor rolls, giving units of these troops perfect morale. The effects of this unholy conditioning last until the Hardened Killer's will is broken (Exalted, p. 174).</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances an enveloping close combat attack by a complementary unit the Abyssal leads, removing the usual -2 external penalty and allowing envelopment of units with equal Magnitude. If the attack succeeds, the enveloped unit's commander must sacrifice a number of health levels equal to the Abyssal's Essence from her unit to order a disengage attempt, regardless of whether that attempt succeeds. Additionally, whenever the enveloped unit loses Magnitude as a result of damage, all members lost in the decrease die rather than escaping. This benefit does not affect the resolution of damage against the unit but prevents remnants from being gathered together as reinforcements by any rally action later in the scene.
   If a deathknight commander successfully envelops a unit of mortals with a unit of walking dead or hungry ghosts, the monsters replenish their ranks by feasting on would-be deserters and the dying to infect them with the unholy power of this Charm. The corpses or lower souls of the slain infected thus rise to join the Abyssal's Abyssal Command. For every two health levels of damage the enveloped unit suffers while this Charm remains active, the Abyssal Command heals one level of lethal or bashing damage. This cannot increase the unit's health levels above maximum or raise its Magnitude. The first time in a battle that a unit composed of mortals witness the undead feasting, the players of their commanders must check for rout at difficulty 3. Even allies panic when confronted with such monstrosity.</description>

        <description>Where heroes fight gloriously at the forefront of battle, pragmatic generals command their champions and forces safely from the rear. The most terrible Abyssal warlords achieve both. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt must select a Magnitude 3+ unit composed of creatures of dark-ness within (Essence x 10) miles that he previously sensed in the scene using Allied in Hate Discernment. That unit's commander must pay five Willpower to remain in charge or step down to become a hero (displacing another special character of her choice if necessary).
   The Abyssal's disembodied presence then suffuses the unit, recalculating its traits for its new leader. Because the Abyssal is not actually present, called shots cannot hit him, nor may he be engaged in a duel or suffer any other dangers of being on the front lines. His projected presence may use Charms like any other unit commander and may communicate through any unit members by distorting their faces and voices with his own likeness to taunt opponents or guide thralls.
   While using this Charm, the Abyssal's own body falls into a coma-like trance. He cannot sense anything other than actual injuries, making him reliant on bodyguards for protection while his attention focuses on the possessed unit. If he ends this Charm voluntarily or the unit's Magnitude drops below 3, he snaps back to his body and the unit begins disintegrating normally until it gains a new leader.</description>

        <description>The cause of death must be championed, whatever the cost. Where support flags amongst the living, the Abyssal general wields the power to change a mortal's perspective. Upon activating Vermillion Plague Conscription, the Abyssal may begin to rectify this situation. A haze of bright murder tinges the Abyssal's anima with the ruby specks of a blood splatter. For the rest of the scene, whenever the deathknight slays a living mortal, that mortal immediately rises as a loyal zombie and begins to follow the deathknight's orders. The Abyssal may create up to (Essence x 5) zombies in this manner within the course of a scene. Zombies created in this fashion retain their animation and their loyalty to the deathknight even after the motes committed to Vermillion Plague Conscription have been released. At Essence 5+, the character may purchase this Charm a second time to increase the number of zombies he may create to (Essence x 10).</description>
