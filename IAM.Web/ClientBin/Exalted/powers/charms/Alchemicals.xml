      <description>In moments of critical necessity, intrinsic competence can receive exponential augmentation. This Charm may be purchased once for each of the nine Attributes, allowing motes to add dice to any Attribute-based action like the First Excellency of the Solar Exalted (see Exalted, p. 183). This Charm and other Attribute Augmentations are Excellencies with another name. The term Excellency was not coined until after Autochthon fashioned the Alchemical blueprints, however, so Champions still use his original nomenclature.</description>

      <description>In the highly interconnected technoecology of Autochthonia, personal failure can lead to cascade failure for others. Such risk is unacceptable. This Charm may be purchased once per Attribute and allows rerolls for actions using the Attribute in question (or doubles the Attribute for calculating a static rating), similar to the Third Excellency of the Lawgivers. The cost to activate this Charm depends on where it is used: 0m within the Godhead of the Elemental Pole of Crystal, 2m inside an Alchemical city, 3m in a healthy area of Autochthonia outside a city and 5m everywhere else.</description>

      <description>For areas of endeavor integral to an Alchemical's designated legend, temporary boosting via mote expenditure is too inefficient. This Charm may purchased for any of the Alchemical's Attributes and may be installed up to (Essence / 2, rounded up) times per Attribute, though the Exalt need commit Personal Essence to only the first installation. Each installation increases the maximum value that the Exalt can have for the Attribute in question and provides one additional dot of that trait. Attribute dots supplied by this Charm do not count toward the experience cost to raise the Attribute, but count as natural dots for all other purposes, including raising the cap for other Attribute Augmentations. The enhancements provided by this Charm are Obvious at all times; the glittering web of electromorphic filaments tracing the head of an Alchemical with boosted Intelligence are every bit as distinctive as the pneumatic musculature of an Exalt with improved Strength.
   Example: An Alchemical with Dexterity 4, Essence 3 installs this Charm twice, raising the Attribute cap from 5 to 7 and raising his effective Dexterity to 6. If he refitted his Dexterity to take advantage of the unused dot of ceiling by improving the rating without this Charm, it would cost experience as if he were purchasing a fifth dot rather than a seventh.</description>

      <description>When operating within their preferred arenas of competence, Alchemicals demonstrate effortless puissance. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt temporarily increases the rating of the Attribute in question by one dot. This temporary dot counts as a bonus die from Charms and can't exceed the limits for such. While in use, this Charm envelops the boosted organ(s) in a distinctive corona of Essence, making it abundantly clear that the Attribute is functioning at superhuman levels. This Charm carries a one-Willpower surcharge the first time it is activated in a scene. Further activations waive this cost.</description>

      <description>Alchemical Exalted rarely concern themselves with training to the same degree as the Chosen of Creation. Like most aspects of Alchemical existence, such competency may be installed and summarily discarded when no longer convenient. This Charm may be installed repeatedly for any Attribute. Each installation links the Attribute in question to expressions of a particular Ability, meaning 225 versions of this Charm technically exist. In the case of Craft, installation covers all possible actions involving all possible Craft variations in conjunction with a particular Attribute. In practice, however, the (Strength + Socialize) model sees considerably less use than common Attribute/Ability pairings such as (Dexterity + Melee) or (Charisma + Presence).
   Whenever an Alchemical with this Charm takes an action using its Attribute/Ability pair, she replaces her normal rating in that Ability with its maximum rating and treats this value as a natural trait. The actual Ability rating does not change outside of valid actions, so this Charm can't be used to bypass the requirements for Martial Arts Charms (or other Ability-based Charms in the case of Eclipse Castes).
   If a character has a maximum natural rating in an Ability and retains vat access, she may trade out obsolete purchases of this Charm for another Alchemical Charm based on the same Attribute at no experience cost, removing the Augmentation from her panoply to substitute the replacement. This can't be done if the obsolete Augmentation is part of an Array, however. All experience spent on submodules for a traded-out Charm is refunded but can be spent only toward acquisition of Alchemical Charms or submodules.
   Example: With a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) installation, an Alchemical with Essence 3, Dexterity 4 and Martial Arts 2 is considered to have Martial Arts 5 whenever she takes an action using that Attribute/Ability pair. She still uses her Martial Arts 2 when pairing the Ability with any other another Attribute. Once she reaches Essence 6, her effective Martial Arts rating will be 6 rather than 5 in accordance with the trait's higher maximum.</description>

         <description>Each installation of this submodule provides one dot of a specialty for the Ability the Charm enhances. This bonus applies whenever the action uses the specific Attribute/Ability pair within the purview of the specialty. There is no limit to the number of times this submodule may be installed, but no specific specialty may be installed more than three times. Furthermore, all applicable specialty bonuses stack to a maximum of +3, regardless of the breadth of the Alchemical's competence.</description>

      <description>Perfection of effort is the holiest of self-augmentations. Transpuissant (Attribute) Upgrade takes the form of fine adamant beads interconnected by the finest filigree of magical material wires, forming a tattoo-like tracery over appropriate organs. The Charm may be installed for each Attribute. When activated, it converts all specialty dice into successes whenever they apply to an action using that Attribute. This includes natural specialties as well as any conferred by Charms or other sources. If the action is a physical attack, the total number of successes added by specialties converts post-soak damage dice into successes against creatures of the Void (so a +2 specialty converts the first two damage dice into successes). Roll unconverted damage dice normally. If the action exerts mental influence on creatures of the Void, this Charm provides double the usual bonus successes as a bonus Axiomatic effect, to a usual maximum of six successes for having +3 in applicable specialties.</description>

         <description>This submodule further refines the function of its Transpuissant (Attribute) Upgrade. Whenever the character takes an action using the appropriate Attribute and performs that action in a manner appropriate to a high-Clarity perspective (as determined by the Storyteller), any stunt bonus associated with that course of action may be applied as successes rather than dice. This submodule does not affect the rewards for successful stunts. Every time an Alchemical converts stunt dice into suc-cesses with this submodule, the character gains one point of Clarity.</description>

      <description>Chance is for the Void. Competency is a calculation, to be measured against the variables of challenge. This Charm replaces most bulky components of other Charms with miniaturized clockwork assemblages and hundreds of needle - thin steam pistons firing like inverse muscle fibers. It can be installed for each Attribute. Whenever the Alchemical takes an action using that Attribute, her player may forgo a roll and apply successes equal to half the total dice pool (rounded up). She may still roll normally, if so desired. Apply the effects of this Charm after all other modifiers to convert whatever dice pool remains.</description>

         <description>By spending five motes and one Willpower to activate Clockwork (Attribute) Perfection Nodes, this submodule adds additional successes equal to the Alchemical's Essence rating to any roll that the Exalt replaces with automatic successes. This boost, however, cannot increase the number of automatic successes above the actual dice pool for the action. When in use, lightning flickers between the turning gears of the Alchemical's clockwork components, but the purpose of this display is unclear and does not make the Charm Obvious.</description>

      <description>A tiny crystal nodule wrapped in hair-thin filaments of red and green Jade is implanted in the Exalt's brain. When tapped, this vast database of sexual techniques and provocative innuendo allows the Alchemical to project a subconscious impression of focused carnal intent, making her an object of intense desire. She doubles the maximum MDV bonus or penalty she can inflict or benefit from based on difference in Appearance.
   In addition to radiating sexuality, the Exalt becomes peerless at the art of lovemaking. Hypnotic body rhythms and inhuman muscle control first entrance partners during the act of consummation, then bring them to exhausting climax, leaving them smitten and easily influenced. Any social attack by the Alchemical whispered in the ear midcoitus or up to one hour following worms deep into the target's psyche, acting as unnatural mental influence that costs two Willpower to resist. If the attack aims to create an Intimacy of lust or infatuation toward the Alchemical, the cost is three Willpower instead, and the attack is undodgeable. If the Exalt imposed unwanted sex on the target through physical force, none of these benefits apply.</description>

      <description>The Exalt's body and movements have received exacting calibration, enabling her to communicate intentions and have a profound impact on others without saying a word. She may make social attacks and otherwise communicate without speaking or taking any obvious action, providing the targets of such attacks can perceive her with at least one of their senses. Outside of combat, this Charm may be used to facilitate quick and subtle battlefield signaling, as well as any other such purpose approved by the Storyteller.
   Observers who are not targeted by social attacks facilitated by this Charm can make a reflexive (Perception + Socialize) roll to realize communication is occurring. The difficulty is (6 - the number of silent communications they have already witnessed this scene) and requires that witnesses directly observe the emoting.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical's ability to emote is so refined that she can affect others even while unconscious or otherwise rendered Inactive. The character remains immobile in such situations but remains aware as though awake and can respond to the situation at hand with social attacks. These attacks may be enhanced with other Charms normally, and the Exalt remembers everything she perceived and did upon awakening. Common examples of use include making a would-be assassin fall in love with the character or run away from her screaming.</description>

      <description>As a complex system of artificial flesh patches and other mechanisms, this Charm betrays no outward signs of its presence. It is designed to physically conceal non-Internal Alchemical Charms, giving as many of them as desired the Internal keyword for the duration of the effect. Affected devices retract and compress under the Exalt's skin through compartment panels, while her claylike flesh morphs and spreads to cover the area they previously occupied. As usual, Obvious Internal Charms reveals themselves for the duration of use, though only to the degree that is necessary to perform the Obvious function. To change which Charms are hidden, the Charm must be reflexively deactivated and then reactivated normally.
   As a final benefit, if all of the Alchemical's Charms have the Internal keyword (whether naturally or from use of this Charm) and she is human-sized, she may transmute her claylike flesh and blood into a perfect simulacrum of human physiology and counter-gravitically compensate for the weight of hidden Charms so that her heavy tread does not betray her nature. In toto, the changes allow her to pass as mortal. An Exalt disguised this way may even retract or modify the appearance of her soulgem as a reflexive action.</description>

         <description>If the Alchemical activates the Charm in Creation or another realm of existence governed by the Loom of Fate, this Axiomatic submodule can send an autonomic prayer to the pattern spiders to indicate that he, a fellow servant of Autochthon, wishes orderly integration. The machine spirits then spin tattered strands from the broken constellation of the Mask around the Champion, bringing him fully into fate with an innocuous and unremarkable destiny for as long as the Charm remains active. He returns to the Design of Autochthon upon conclusion.
   NB: This submodule will not exist until Alchemicals encounter Creation and discover the horrifying fact that their unregistered presence disrupts the local weave, indirectly (and unintentionally) strengthening the Void.</description>

         <description>While the Charm is active, all Internal Charms the Exalt has are invisible to Essence sight and other means of supernatural detection unless they are active and Obvious. If no Charms are eligible for detection this way, the Alchemical may choose to cloak the fact that she is an Essence user, in which case she seems to have Essence 1. Toggling the Essence cloak on and off is a reflexive action, but the cloak drops automatically and can't be maintained while her anima banner is flaring at all or is revealed by Obvious Charm use. If an opposing Charm seeks to penetrate an active Essence cloak, add the Exalt's Appearance rating as bonus dice to the roll-off.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical can activate his Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier to disguise his Void Charms, rather than internalizing them. Alchemical Charms corrupted by Voidtech submodules revert to their normal appearance, while Void-keyworded Charms are rendered seemingly mechanical in nature. Activating an Obvious Void Charm still reveals its true nature, and this concealment is overcome by any effect which bypasses the usual effect of Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier. If the Alchemical conceals all of his installed Void Charms, then his nature as an Apostate cannot be detected by any means.</description>

      <description>This Charm enhances its prerequisite. While using the Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier, the Champion can reflexively alter her anima banner to resemble any other specific caste or aspect of Exalt she has personally witnessed and clearly remembers seeing. Even non-Alchemical animas may be copied this way. In effect, the character uses the appropriate anima banner table in lieu of her own, meaning she gains a caste mark and no longer leaks magical materials if disguised as a Celestial and radiates anima flux while copying a Terrestrial, et cetera. Caste- or aspect-specific physical features are also copied, such as Terrestrial aspect markings or the predominant magical material used in the construction of a visibly Alchemical body. The character's specific iconic anima at the 16-mote level and above remains distinctive to her soul, however, which could spoil the disguise depending on its appropriateness to her feigned anima type. The operation of Charms does not change, so a "Solar" whose body whips out a pneumatic cannon will certainly raise eyebrows from those who know that that is not how Lawgiver magic works.
   Use of this Charm changes only anima display, not anima power.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of hundreds of tiny wire hooks linking pistons to key points under the Exalt's skin, as well as a bank of Essence-fueled pigment injectors. Upon activation, the Alchemical recalibrates his physical appearance as an extremely rapid disguise action, substituting Appearance for Intelligence without the need for props or prior study of the target beyond a moment's observation. For its duration, the Charm changes the Champion's body instead of merely hiding its true appearance, allowing instant alterations to sex (including hermaphroditic or asexual, the latter of which provides a +3 MDV bonus against all seduction-based mental influence), overall physique, build, race, voice modulation and pigmentation (including introducing inhuman hues and adding or removing tattoos and scars).
   The Exalt cannot modify his new body's final height or weight by more than 10 percent of its unmodified measurements. Virtually any body that a human being could have is fair game for the Charm, even body types that are crippled, deformed, unhealthy or otherwise damaged. Disguising oneself as a character with a lower or higher Appearance rating does not adjust the operation or effectiveness of Charms based on that Attribute, though it affects reactions normally (such as social combat modifiers). Use of this Charm's prerequisite is still necessary to avoid having visibly implanted Charms spoil the disguise. Generally speaking, the changes wrought by the Charm result in a difficulty 1 for the disguise roll or 2 if attempting to copy a specific person.
   The effectiveness of a disguise created by Husk-Sculpting Apparatus is based on the threshold generated by the roll as normal, but the Charm is imperfect. Witnesses with a (Perception + Awareness) total of 11+ or who have any superhumanly acute senses automatically recognize him as an imposter upon encountering him without need for a roll or suspicion. Although many animals have superhuman senses, few are intelligent enough or well trained enough to care about a disguise when determining how they react. The Charm is even weaker against Essence sight or comparable Charms, as witnesses with such powers automatically perceive the Alchemical's true form overlaid on the disguise. Of course, failure to use Integrated Artifact Transmogrifier to hide all Charms when disguised as anything other than another Alchemical also spoils the ruse. Once the Charm deactivates, the Alchemical's body resets to its true form.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical can pay four extra Willpower when activating the Charm to disguise himself as himself, save for whatever modifications he wishes to apply. He can, for example, become himself but female or himself but skinnier, yet he cannot use that activation of the Charm to assist in impersonating someone else. As soon as the work is complete, the Charm deactivates and leaves behind the desired changes as permanent modifications to the character's body. The original unmodified shape of the character's body remains only as a notional concept to determine the validity of possible changes. As these changes are real, they do not alert appropriate senses that a disguise is being used, and they remain even if the Charm is uninstalled.</description>

         <description>A chrome rivet in the Exalt's throat with wires threaded through his voice box allows him to mimic any types of sounds he has heard before. While the Charm is active, his vocal precision blocks superhumanly acute hearing from automatically piercing its disguise. In addition, he can speak in the voice of anyone he has heard talk, replicate animal, machine or other inhuman noises, replay an eidetic auditory memory of any scene and perform other such feats of sonic puissance. With Essence 4+, he can issue booming vocal utterances like grinding metal that can be heard for a mile and deafen all mortals within (Appearance x 10) yards. Deafness induced this way wears off an hour after the listener last heard the sound.</description>

      <description>A lattice of sand-sized crystals studded through the Exalt's flesh gives her a slightly iridescent sheen when viewed under bright lighting. Charged with Essence, the lattice generates an optic camouflage. The Alchemical wavers like a heat-mirage for a moment, then vanishes. As long as the Exalt makes no rapid or violent motion (physical attacks, Dash or Jump actions, etc.) and does not move more than one yard per tick, she remains invisible and impossible to detect via sight, regardless of acuity. Unless she speaks or otherwise gives herself away, attempts to locate her through mundane sound or smell are made with an external penalty of (higher of her Essence or Appearance). She can be detected by touch and taste normally. Characters with superhumanly acute hearing or sense of smell ignore this camouflage and may interact with the Exalt normally, as can characters with exotic senses that do not depend at all on sight (such as heat detection and echolocation) or some form of Essence sight.
   Moving any faster than the permitted speed by means of personal locomotion does not end the Charm, but causes the Alchemical to appear as an Obvious rippling distortion in the air that is automatically visible. She fully vanishes again on the tick in which she next moves at an acceptable speed, though until she discreetly moves from that location, any attacks made against her by those who saw where she stopped ignore the Charm's protection. Traveling within a vehicle or by other external means does not disrupt the camouflage this way. Extremely rapid or violent movement (such as the activation of a Plasma Thruster Assembly or the initiation of an attack) terminates the Charm.</description>

      <description>The Exalt has a sensor built into his fingertip connecting to his Optical Shroud. By touching another being and activating this Charm, the Champion may attune that character to his cloaking system. Separate activations can concomitantly apply this blessing to up to (Appearance + Essence) individuals. Whenever a character tagged this way is within 50 yards of the Alchemical and Optical Shroud is activated, the effected character cloaks as well, including all upgrades from submodules. They remain cloaked as long as the Exalt maintains his own invisibility or until they break out of its concealment via sudden or violent movement. Reactivation of that Charm gathers them back into the effect and hides them once more. As an additional benefit, all characters hidden by the same Champion's cloaking system can ignore it and perceive one another normally, though they can distinguish that they are all hidden.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical may attune an entire military unit with Magnitude equal to or less than his Essence rating in lieu of an individual, paying five motes and five Willpower to do so. For the unit to enjoy the benefits of cloaking, the Champion must be a special character in the unit, the unit must have Drill 3+ and it must remain in close formation. Once any member breaks out of the cloak via attack, changing formation or the like (including actions by special characters), the entire unit appears and requires reactivation of Hidden Assembly Conclave to hide again.</description>

      <description>This Charm expands upon the technology of the Optical Shroud, diverting Essence through white Jade baffles that dampen the resulting display. With the Aura-Dampening Component installed, motes spent on Stealth and Disguise Charms do not contribute to the Champion's anima banner. The Storyteller should also extend this benefit to any effects from other Charms deemed solely applicable to stealth or disguise purposes. The effects of this Charm may even be extended to all Augmentation use, but doing so adds a one-mote surcharge to the activation.</description>

      <description>An array of lead plates, black Jade baffles and Essence-redirecting adamant coils deploy, forcibly suppressing the Alchemical's anima banner. It flickers like a failing circuit and then disappears altogether. The process is briefly but intensely painful. The Exalt's anima is truly dampened out but will flare again with further expenditure of Peripheral Essence. This Charm costs three Willpower if the anima is at the eight- to 10-mote level or brighter, only two Willpower if dimmer than that, and one Willpower if previously activated in the scene.</description>

      <description>The Alchemical's body is full of technological tumors and pustular nodules of smoke-stained moonsilver. Upon activation, the Apostate's flesh tears and twists inside out, undergoing gruesome metamorphosis to deploy a mutation package like that provided by Manifold Transhuman Implants (see pp. 167-168). Unlike that Charm, the maximum number of mutation points in the package is (Essence + total Dissonance), and the package may be completely reconfigured with each use. Even mutations that make the Exalt smaller are permissible. The Charm self-deactivates if the Apostate's total Dissonance decreases for any reason, reverting her to her true form until she reactivates it. It is possible to invoke this Charm offensively or defensively to make specific mutations available for that attack. This Charm costs three motes to activate in a blight zone and five motes everywhere else, though a three-mote activation self-deactivates if the character leaves the blight zone.</description>

When activated, this Charm radiates a pulse of Essence throughout a complementary unit in which the Alchemical is a special character, up to a Magnitude equal to his Essence rating. The pulse instills each soldier with an instinctive awareness of his commander's tactical prowess and unit's role in his plans. As long as the unit remains in close formation, it gets +3 Drill (even if this bonus temporarily raises Drill above 5).</description>

It shines forth an enormously bright beacon upon activation, stirring feelings of loyalty and uplifted morale in all soldiers who witness it. This Charm may be used to supplement a unit leader's roll to rally for numbers, provided the Alchemical is a special character in that unit.

      <description>Luminescent artificial glands are implanted beneath the Alchemical's skin. When this Charm is used to supplement a social attack, the glands divert a trickle of power from his anima to transform the way light and shadow play across his body, producing deep shadows and bright planes. He looks both inspiring and intimidating, like a commemorative statue or propaganda poster. Few are able to resist the dictates of such a starkly heroic figure.
   This Charm can enhance any social attack intended to convince a single target to take some action to support a social group to which he or the Alchemical belongs. Resisting this influence costs two Willpower, though the attack can be natural or unnatural depending on the intended force of the Champion's words. If the Exalt channels Conviction to aid the attack, add his rating as bonus successes rather than dice.</description>

      <description>Bands of the Champion's magical material are injected into the skin of her face, forming hypnotic patterns reminiscent of war paint. When suffused with Essence, the patterns reinforce attempts at forging unity. This Charm may supplement any social attack based on an Attribute for which the Exalt has an installed Augmentation, provided he attempts to convince one or more targets to favorably regard a social group separate from but roughly equivalent to a social group to which the targets belong. The attack can use Presence if only one target is present, but it must use Performance otherwise. If using Performance, only targets who are members of an equivalent group are affected by the Charm's power, though other witnesses could still be moved by the unmodified social attack. Those affected by the Charm feel as directed until they pay three Willpower to shake off the unnatural Emotion effect (or one Willpower if the selected social group has taken actions that directly damage their artificial reputation).
   For example, the members of one work shift might be convinced to like members of a separate work shift, or citizens of one nation might become well inclined toward citizens of another nation. Non-equivalent groups are not valid targets, though. This Charm could not help convince a factory full of Populat workers to support their local Tripartite Assembly, for instance.</description>

      <description>A rosette pattern of the magical materials surrounds the Exalt's soulgem, signifying her identity as an ordained Champion of faith and hierarchy, elevated above the forces of chaos and entropy. As long as this Charm is installed, all social attacks directed against creatures of the Void cost an additional Willpower to resist (to a maximum of five Willpower). The Exalt may also spend four motes in Step Two of combat resolution to perfectly dodge any mental influence that would make him act against the dictates of Clarity, whether to be more human or outright blasphemous to the Great Maker's Design. Use of this defense does not count as a Charm activation, but the Storyteller decides whether it is applicable.</description>

         <description>Upon making a successful social attack against an Alchemical with temporary or permanent Gremlin Syndrome - provided the target does not resist the attack with Willpower expenditure - the attacker may commit one mote plus one mote for each time this effect has been used on that target in her life. The infusion suppresses Gremlin Syndrome for one week, converting Dissonance into Clarity while the motes remain committed. The suppression does not stack. One treatment must wear off before another may be applied. The target may deliberately revert to "normal" at any time by reflexively paying one Willpower.</description>

If the attack hits, filaments of light flash outward in every direction like spider webs, and the target becomes a creature of the Void as a Shaping effect, drawing a momentary red glare from all machine spirits who spin fate in the target's current realm of existence. The heretic can remove this label with a full month spent in penitent and rigorous observance of the Great Maker's laws as revealed to Autochthonia or the Jadeborn, a mercy not available to beings inherently associated with the Void.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a delicate half torc anchored by a rivet in the throat. The Champion makes a social attack against a single target within one yard using ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence), in which he extols the virtues of his Motivation. Any Virtue channel applied to this attack adds successes instead of dice. If the attack succeeds, the target's Motivation is temporarily suppressed and replaced by the Alchemical's own Motivation. Immediately and at any point thereafter, the target may pay four Willpower to reassert her own values. (This cost can be paid in installments). Alternatively, the target can change his own Motivation to accept the imposed purpose as a true change. Not only does this change not cost experience, but the sense of renewed purpose restores all spent Willpower the first time this happens in a scene. Slight changes in the wording of a Motivation are permitted where logical - such as an Alchemical with a Motivation of "Be the greatest weapons inventor in history" imposing "Help [Alchemical Name] be the greatest weapon inventor in history".</description>

         <description>The Charm may be used at standard speaking range for a social attack. A second installation of this submodule at Essence 6 allows it to be used in conjunction with a Performance based attack, but an area-effect use wears off on its own after a day, even if unresisted.</description>

         <description>This submodule improves the power of Motivational Vocoder to enslave other creatures of the Void. Against such targets, Virtue channeling is impossible, but the character adds bonus successes equal to his Essence rating. If the target is a gremlin with equal or lower Essence and succumbs to the Charm, the Apostate may give it any Motivation he desires, and it cannot even spend Willpower to escape until it goes more days than its master's Manipulation rating without interacting with him. Until the gremlin escapes or the Apostate reinstalls his Motivational Vocoder without this submodule, the gremlin must obey him like a demon bound to his service (see Exalted, pp. 252-253), though the Intimacy behind the obedience is hateful fear rather than loyalty. The Intimacy remains and shifts to pure hate if the gremlin breaks free, and it acts accordingly. When targeting a gremlin it can bind, the Charm can be used in personal combat with a Speed measured in ticks rather than long ticks, as a single imperious command assaults the spirit's mind.</description>

      <description>The Alchemical has an artificial complex implanted into her brain, attached to a tiny transmitter diode located just above her ear. It emits a subliminal pulse when triggered, tipping popular opinion toward an agenda the Exalt promotes. This Charm functions identically to Taboo Inflicting Diatribe (see Exalted, p. 238) with the following exceptions:
   It may be used only to encourage the adoption of a new course of action that does not conflict with the group's current Policy. The new agenda remains part of the group's Policy until its leader spends a total of six Loyalty to remove it. Only one Loyalty can be spent in this manner per day.</description>

      <description>A series of etched and programmed red memory crystals are implanted in the logic centers of the Champion's brain. These crystals contain an exhaustive catalog of doctrinal arguments and dogmatically orthodox Autochthonian moral parables. When confronted with heretical blandishments, the Exalt automatically locates and presents the correct justification for denying such requests. This Charm functions as a perfect social parry, even against unblockable attacks. It costs four motes to invoke in Autochthonia and six motes in other realms of existence.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical may activate the Charm at usual cost to defend another character he can perceive, interrupting the attacker with righteous retorts. Such a defense is not perfect, but instead allows the target to substitute the Exalt's (Parry MDV + Compassion) for her own MDV, if trait is lower. This borrowed MDV may be applied against unblockable attacks, however. The cost to defend other characters from a specific attacker cumulatively decreases by one mote per use (to a minimum of one mote) until that attacker directs a social attack at the Alchemical.</description>

      <description>The Exalt has a cluster of orichalcum threads tangled around a Jade nodule in his chest, the entire mass of which adjoins his Essence reservoir. Used to supplement an action in which the Alchemical benefits from or contributes to a limited teamwork bonus (see Exalted, p. 125), the bonus applies as additional successes rather than dice as the participants move with perfect clockwork synchronicity. Moreover, the number of assistants that may contribute aid is based on the Attribute or Ability used by the primary character (whichever is higher).</description>

      <description>The Alchemical possesses literally wired reflexes. Starmetal nerve clusters and tiny orichalcum acceleration nodes are fitted into either the Alchemical's arms and torso, or her legs and hips. These options constitute two separate Charms, which must be purchased and installed independently. Both versions of the Charm eliminate penalty values against the character's DV equal to the character's (Dexterity). The upper body option permits this enhancement to apply to the character's Parry DV, while the lower body enhances Dodge DV. Installing both variants at once allows them to trigger simultaneously for two motes, without the need of an Array. The Alchemical need not commit a mote for the second installation.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a line of starmetal wires and nodes climbing the Alchemical's spine. It connects to an adamant calculating array inside his skull and to his Accelerated Response System. Faced with an attack or a form of threatening environmental damage, this array calculates a perfect evasive position and automatically shifts the Alchemical's body with clockwork precision to avoid harm. This effect acts as a perfect dodge against any attack of which the Exalt is aware. It does not allow him to avoid undodgeable attacks or environmental damage that could not conceivably be dodged, subject to Storyteller approval. (The Alchemical could theoretically weave his way unharmed through a rockslide, but he would have nowhere even temporarily safe to dodge if he were immersed in a pool of acid). This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Alchemical Invulnerability.</description>

By paying an additional mote upon activation, this submodule makes him momentarily immaterial, allowing him to perfectly dodge undodgeable attacks and all-encompassing environmental effects. This rerouting of power makes the Precalculated Evasion System less accurate, however, affording only the Alchemical's usual DV against attacks capable of striking dematerialized targets. This submodule also allows the Alchemical to activate his Transphase Engine for utility purposes, such as to leap through any barrier thin enough to traverse with a tick's worth of movement.</description>

      <description>A web of hair-thin wires stretches across the Alchemical's cheek from the corner of her eye, disappearing beneath her skin at the jaw line. The wires reemerge at her wrists, running to the tips of her fingers. When this Charm is triggered, the Alchemical unleashes a rapid series of attacks that each enjoys greater accuracy than the last, progressively zeroing in on her target.
   Recursive Fractal Targeting Calculations creates a magical flurry of attacks at the character's full dice pool, with a Speed rating and DV penalty equal to the highest values within the flurry. The number of attacks is equal to the lower of the Alchemical's Dexterity or Wits, ignoring Rate. All attacks must be targeted at a single opponent. If an attack fails to strike the target, the Alchemical cumulatively adds one die to his next attack within the flurry. Successfully hitting the target resets this bonus to zero.</description>

After a moment of furious processing, this system feeds target data into a set of resonant neural pathways built into the Champion's body, allowing the Exalt to perfectly synchronize with her opponent's movements. Exactingly calibrated to move slightly faster than the target, she aims and strikes without the possibility for error. An attack enhanced by this Charm cannot be dodged.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of an advanced lattice of synthetic neural clusters and psychokinetic vector modulators painstakingly wired into an Alchemical's arms, spine and brain. Externally, this nervelattice appears as a set of geometric tattoos and filigree that glows when powered with Peripheral Essence. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt may direct a single projectile to strike multiple targets in succession, either slashing past them or punching clean through their bodies before arcing in the air to hunt out another unfortunate victim.
   This Charm creates a magical flurry with a Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest values of any action within the flurry. All attacks are made at the Exalt's full dice pool, ignore Rate and must be aimed at a different target. The Exalt may purchase up to (Essence + 1) attacks. Every attack within the flurry that successfully inflicts damage immediately reimburses two motes of its cost through sympathetic Essence resonance.</description>

      <description>Implants on the Champion's joints connect to his Accelerated Response System, allowing his body to take greater advantage of his boosted nervous system. This Charm has two modes of function, which may be employed simultaneously.
   Used as a one-action Charm, Celerity Enabling Module costs five motes and performs identically to Bulwark Stance (see Exalted, p. 193), save that it enhances only the DV types matching the character's current Accelerated Response System installations.
   In its second mode, this Charm costs five motes and one Willpower and lasts for one scene. The character must select one opponent at the time of activation. She ignores all penalties to her DVs corresponding to current Accelerated Response System installations when defending against this opponent. This includes penalties due to her own actions. As always, DV inapplicability is not a penalty. Should the Alchemical wish to change designated opponents, she must terminate and reinvoke this Charm.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical can change designated opponents using the Charm's second mode without the reactivation counting as a Charm use. If the previous target is unconscious, dead or otherwise completely neutralized, or if the new target is a creature of the Void, the cost to shift targets is only five motes.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a ribbed plate on the Exalt's inner forearm. When charged with Essence, a compartment near the wrist opens, extending an Essence-forged missile on an articulated tendril. The missile is sized appropriately for the Champion's body and automatically feeds itself into an Archery weapon with its loading tendril. This Charm is identical to Phantom Arrow Technique (see Exalted, p. 189) with the following additions: It may also be used to create projectiles and ammunition (including Thrown weapons) costing up to Resources 2, for a cost of two motes. All weapons created by this Charm endure for one minute before disintegrating. Reflexively paying one Willpower when this time elapses extends the life span of a projectile until the end of the scene.</description>

      <description>Microscopic targeting beams mounted in the Alchemical's tear ducts activate, painting an arc of targets and marking them for destruction. Automated combat algorithms drive the Champion's body in a clockwork dance of death, moving and striking with a merciless economy of motion. Moments later, only the dead and disabled remain.
   This Charm can enhance any attack against a Magnitude 3+ complementary unit the Alchemical faces as a solo unit. It negates the target's DV bonus for superior Magnitude and doubles the Exalt's attack roll successes for the purpose of calculating raw damage (or triples it if the unit is arranged into close formation).</description>

      <description>A pair of telescoping orichalcum fins extends from the back of the Alchemical's shoulders. When charged with Essence, these hum audibly and agitate the Champion's anima banner to the 11- to 15-mote level if it is not there already. The anima display is either projected high into the air or, in more cramped environments, distributed along the ground as a vast, roiling fog that creeps back in among the Exalt's troops. When the Alchemical relays orders, his anima flashes pictoglyphic images that are intuitively understood by all soldiers fighting under his command and encrypted against opponents. This Charm replaces the need for up to three relays for a unit in which the Alchemical is a special character, leaving additional special character slots for heroes and sorcerers.</description>

As a further Axiomatic effect, the units with Drill 4 or less gain perfect morale while engaged with an enemy unit consisting chiefly of creatures of the Void.

If the Exalt has Essence 4+, units that cannot see the Champion's unit are also valid targets, provided they are within one mile and the Alchemical knows they are in range to target. In such cases, luminous glyphs flash in front of the receiving unit leader's face in a quick strobe to deliver the message.</description>

      <description>Memory crystal nodules are inserted into ports on the back of the Alchemical's head, containing thousands of years' worth of collected tactical insights on how to maximize the potential of close-formation troops fighting in cramped environments. This Charm has two effects. First, it permits units with Drill 0 or 1 in which the Exalt is a special character to assume close formation in mass combat. Second, if a unit actually has Drill 2+, it ignores all penalties for fighting in close formation, while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of relaxed formation.</description>

      <description>This Charm's outer appearance depends on the prerequisite upon which it builds. When attached to external plating, it takes the form of a bulky gauntlet around one of the Alchemical's wrists. For internal assemblies, a spiral pattern appears to have been seared into the back of the Exalt's arm, centering on an orichalcum nodule. In either case, the Charm hums and crackles upon activation, projecting a shaped potentiality field that appears as a slender wedge of radiance. When presented with an incoming hazard, this field telescopes open into a shield etched from solid light that provides a +3 DV cover bonus against all attacks without any associated fatigue or mobility penalties. Unexpected attacks bypass this protection. The active shield disrupts stealth like an anima banner at the eight- to 10-mote level.</description>

         <description>Whenever the shield applies its penalty to an attack that hits anyway, an Alchemical with this submodule may focus the Charm's power in Step Six to perfectly parry the attack. Doing so does not require a Charm activation, and even unblockable attacks may be stopped. Although the defense has no flaw of invulnerability, parrying an attack this way overloads the shield, involuntarily deactivating the Charm and preventing reactivation until the Exalt spends an hour recalibrating it as a diceless dramatic action. Essence 5+ Alchemicals may prevent overload by paying five motes per parry up to (Essence) times per scene, but they suffer the usual overload to parry afterward.</description>

         <description>If the shield is deployed against a damage source composed entirely of fire, lightning or other raw energy or Essence discharge of any type, the Alchemical also regains a number of motes equal to (his Essence x 2) or the raw damage of the attack, whichever is less. The effective raw damage of an attack that misses has zero attack successes applied to it. This absorption occurs whether or not the attack hits, as long as it garners at least one success to aim close enough to drain.</description>

The character ignores off-hand penalties to actions. Furthermore, each installation reduces all of the character's multiple action penalties by one die. While he may initially sustain only one installation of this Charm, Essence 3+ Champions may install this Charm a number of times equal to or less than their Dexterity or Wits (whichever is lower). Installations of the Multiple Limbs mutation (see Exalted, p. 290) function identically for Alchemicals, and count toward this Charm's installation cap.</description>

      <description>Depending on configuration, the Alchemical features complex telescoping articulation in all limbs or stretching moonsilver implants. Upon activation, the Alchemical's limbs surge and crackle with Essence, unfolding or softening in preparation for extension. For the rest of the scene, the Champion may reflexively extend or retract his limbs up to (Essence x 2) yards, or (Essence x 4) if his Essence is 6 or higher. All attacks made while this Charm is active gain the R tag on top of the obvious benefit of making close combat attacks at range. Any close combat counterattacks against the Champion must also target the limbs as a called shot at a -2 external penalty unless the counterattack has similar reach.</description>

      <description>This Charm appears as a coin-Shaped node on the left temple, formed of a gold-shifted rainbow alloy of starmetal and orichalcum. Its power enhances the Alchemical's capacity to assist a unit in which she is a special character other than the unit commander and the commander is another Alchemical. First, the Alchemical using the Charm counts simultaneously as a hero, a sorcerer and a relay, with all the best benefits and options afforded by each role. Second, the commander may use the Alchemical's War rating in place of his own, if the Alchemical's rating is higher. Third, whenever the unit acts, both the assisting Alchemical and the commander may aid the unit by activating one of their Charms, though this does not increase the number of actions the unit receives. No Combo is necessary to enjoy this cooperation, however, allowing both characters to apply a supplemental Charm to the same attack, for example. If multiple special characters have this Charm, only one of them may contribute his War rating and offer a Charm per action, though all count as triple-role officers as normal. Effects of this Charm persist only while the unit is arranged in close formation.</description>

      <description>White Jade circuitry imprinted onto the surface of the brain circumvents its logic centers to automatically reject certain lines of argument. This Charm is identical to Righteous Lion Defense (see Exalted, p. 199), with the following change: Rather than making inviolate an Intimacy to one of his visions or ideals, the Alchemical must choose an Intimacy dedicated to the service of something larger than himself. This duty may be to a society, an organization, a social class or even a mission, but it cannot be an individual and must not originate with the Exalt. The greater good reinforced by this Charm can benefit the Alchemical, but only as he is a component of that good. If society prospers, the Exalt may prosper, but this Charm affords no protection if he seeks his prosperity over the good of others or ignores his duty in order to pursue selfish ends.</description>

A complicated network of neural wires connects these nodes and links the entire assembly to the prongs of his soulgem. Each installation of this Charm holds three artificial specialties of the Exalt's choosing, which may be reconfigured at the vats. A character may not add more than three dice from specialties to any roll. The Exalt may pay three experience points to permanently learn an installed specialty without any training time.

      <description>This Charm takes the form of thousands of microscopic automata scuttling through the Exalt's entire nervous system. When powered with Essence, these creatures link their spindly legs in artificial neural chains that vastly upgrade the interconnectivity of thought and memory. As they combine, the automata resonate in perfect synchronicity with the psychic emanations of the Machine God.
   Upon activation, the Alchemical gains a point of temporary Clarity, and this Charm replaces the natural rating of any single Ability with the Exalt's total Clarity for one action. The Ability's rating does not change apart from determining the number of dice contributed to the one roll or static value calculation. Actions benefiting from this Charm cannot also benefit from a Virtue channel. The base cost to activate Clarified Data Assimilator is four motes, but each invocation also adds a cumulative one-mote surcharge to future use until the Champion spends an hour meditating to reset his mind.</description>

      <description>Artificial synapse webs installed in the Alchemical's brain allow him to render any form of communication into raw numeric data and reconfigure it to mesh with currently understood modes of expression. After spending at least an hour listening to or attempting to read an unfamiliar language, the Alchemical may learn to speak or read it himself, paying five motes to do so. He must pay for languages individually and pay separately for spoken and written fluency. When speaking a language provided by this Charm, the Exalt's accent is thick with distinctive inflections and idioms taken from Autochthonic, enough so that anyone listening can tell he is not a native speaker of his assumed tongue. This accent does not inhibit communication, however. Conferred aptitude remains as long as the Exalt leaves Essence committed to the language. Emulated languages may be permanently integrated with no training times, if desired, as a Training effect.</description>

      <description>A metallic sublobe is added to the top of the Alchemical's brain, providing an intuitive database of mechanical and magical engineering principles. This Charm reduces the difficulty to repair any piece of magitech by three.
   Additionally, the Alchemical reduces by one dot each the minimum Craft, Lore, Medicine and Occult requirements to build or repair artifacts, to a minimum requirement of one dot for any Ability normally required for the task. Therefore, a four-dot artifact (normally requiring Lore, Occult and Craft 6 to build and 5 to repair) would require those Abilities at only 5 to build or 4 to repair. This Charm may be installed twice, though the second installation requires Essence 5+.</description>

      <description>Autochthon is the Machine God, and the works of his materials are paradigmatically his body. This Charm takes the form of a complex engine mechanism built into the torso adjacent to the central Essence reservoir. It can be activated in one of two ways. For a cost of one mote, the Exalt can internalize an artifact he owns and is touching. The artifact in question can't be notably larger than the Exalt and must predominantly consist of the same magical material as the Alchemical's caste (or an artifact with no material-based permutations). Internalizing a device causes it to fold up with a distinctive whirring-clicking noise and slide into hidden compartments within the Exalt's body. This process bypasses conventional laws of conservation regarding mass and volume, such that each internalized artifact adds no more than a pound to overall weight.
   While internalized, the artifact is as inaccessible and immune to the passage of time as if it were stored Elsewhere. Ending the one-mote commitment causes the artifact to emerge from the body unattuned, but unlike most Charms, the act of releasing an artifact this way is not reflexive and instead requires a zero-mote activation of Technomorphic Integration Engine. The death of the Alchemical causes all internalized objects to emerge from the smoking carcass.
   Alternatively, the Alchemical may activate this Charm by paying the standard mote cost to attune an internalized artifact (such as five motes for a daiklave). In this case, the artifact unfolds out of the Exalt's body attuned and immediately available for use as the prior one-mote commitment lapses. Weapons unfolded to hand are drawn and otherwise readied as part of extruding them. Armor cannot be unfolded as immediate protection, but it may be donned normally. This Charm can't be swapped out while any objects remain internalized.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical can internalize non-magical items of appropriate size and ownership as if they were valid artifacts for one mote each. No cost is required to attune them on extrusion, as this is not required to use such items. The death of the Exalt does not release such objects. Instead, they are destroyed. A second installation of this submodule reduces the cost to store mundane objects to zero motes, but the cost to activate Technomorphic Integration Engine to extrude them is one mote (uncommitted).</description>

         <description>The Alchemical perfectly understands all properties, powers and other characteristics of any object in the moment of internalizing it. This knowledge remains even after the item is extruded. Through comprehensive empathy algorithms that harmonize with new technology, the Exalt also can internalize objects that lack an owner (claiming instant ownership in the process). Finally, the cumulative difficulty to make a copy, improve a copy or make an improved version of any internalized object via appropriate Craft rolls is halved, rounded up. The example must remain internalized for the entire period of crafting for this benefit to apply.</description>

      <description>A slender tentacle slides out of a compartment in the Alchemical's torso, tipped with a long, hollow needle. The transparent tendril can reach and touch targets up to two yards away, nimbly targeting a patient's veins or vital clusters. After the needle slides in, quivers of peristaltic motion pump drugs into the patient's body from storage nodes inside the Alchemical. These nodes convert raw Essence into known alchemical formulae as a predominantly benevolent Poison effect.
   If this Charm is used to inject an unwilling patient, resolve as a touch attack using either Martial Arts or Medicine, and with a piercing "damage" of +0L. If the needle would inflict any health levels of damage, this injury is replaced with the effects of injection. The Alchemical may also inject himself internally.
   At the time of purchase, the Exalt gains two of the templates listed as submodules. Additional formulas from the thaumaturgical Art of Alchemy may be downloaded as submodules at the vats for two experience points each. Any alchemy formula with a medicinal application may be adapted and loaded into this Charm, unless expressly vetoed by the Storyteller for balance considerations. For example, eagle's eye potion and valiant warrior formula are valid submodules, but the heavenly transmutation processes are not. More on the Art of Alchemy may be found in The Books of Sorcery, Vol. III - Oadenol's Codex, pages 129-132. Storytellers should encourage players to design submodules of their own.</description>

         <description>This injection replicates a dose of sweet cordial (see Exalted, p. 378). Like that drug, the infusion cannot heal aggravated damage, and its narcotic haze imposes a one-die internal penalty to non-reflexive actions as a Poison effect.</description>

         <description>This crimson fluid is a powerful painkiller and euphoric, allowing patients to ignore wound penalties and apply Virtues as basic automata do for one scene: automatically succeeding on Valor rolls and automatically failing others. Patients with a Clarity or Dissonance track gain one temporary point. Patients cannot channel Virtues while under the influence, and they suffer an internal penalty of -4 to Stamina when it wears off. Each day of complete rest removes one die of this penalty.</description>

It can take effect immediately or remain dormant for any time specified by the Apostate, up to one year. Another dose during dormancy resets the duration as desired. Dormant toxin remains in the victim's system as an inert magical Poison effect for the duration, then takes effect.</description>

      <description>The Alchemical Exalted embody the rightness of the Great Maker's artifice. When this Charm is activated, an array of glowing vacuum tubes slides out of ports in the Exalt's back and shoulders. The character radiates the stability of the Machine God out to a radius of (total Clarity x 10) yards, neutralizing all Wyld or blight zone influences and imposing the proper physical laws of Autochthonia. Voidtech Charms cost an additional mote to activate in this radius. Displaced blights still lack Essence to respire. Because Autochthon recognizes the validity of the world he helped forge, this Charm imposes the laws of Creation when used in Creation, duplicating Chaos-Repelling Pattern (see Exalted, p. 216). The cost to activate this Charm is (10 - Essence) motes.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of an adamant ring implanted around the Alchemical's soulgem, inscribed with hundreds of tiny Old Realm glyphs. When activated, the crystal rapidly spins in its socket and the runes inscribed along its rim light up in patterns consistent with the protocol being invoked. At the consummation of the casting, sparks jump from the ring into the Exalt's soulgem before discharging with a brilliant display of power. This Charm may never be removed once installed, but it does not function for characters infected with Gremlin Syndrome.
   The character may take Weave Man-Machine Protocol actions, which are identical to Shape Terrestrial Circle Sorcery actions save that they invoke a Man-Machine protocol rather than a spell. For full details on protocol weaving, see Chapter Six. This Charm cannot be placed in an Array.</description>

         <description>This submodule gives permanent Gremlin Syndrome.
   A Man-Machine Weaving Engine perverted by this submodule reawakens in spite of its bearer's Dissonance, but no longer interfaces with the Design. Instead, the Charm allows the Apostate to learn and cast spells as if she knew the Charms Terrestrial Circle Sorcery and Shadowlands Circle Necromancy. Such spells cost 12 experience points apiece, but the Exalt can also permanently excise a known (and now useless) protocol from her mind in lieu of paying this experience. Spells may be learned as other Exalted learn them from texts or teachers. Alternatively, Apostates can study a blight zone to unlock the secrets of Autochthon's decay as though learning a spell from an actual mentor, in which case the player pays the cost at the beginning of training. The Storyteller chooses a spell that will support the Apostate's Motivation once training is complete. Destructive Motivations yield destructive spells, while a desire for power tends toward mental influence effects, and so on.
   When casting a spell, the Man-Machine Weaving Engine reveals its desecration by growing jagged saw teeth along its inner ring. These blades grind against the Alchemical's indestructible soulgem with a shrieking whine, throwing a shower of sparks and smoke as it unleashes its magic. The effects of spells cast this way distort to reflect the aesthetics of Autochthon's decay, so Death of Obsidian Butterflies might hurl a shower of rusting, razor-edged cogs instead of the usual projectiles. The player may supply this distortion as a stunt. Otherwise, the Storyteller determines how the spell cosmetically warps. No distortion should extend to the point of altering the resolution of the spell's effects. While intact, the Seal of Eight Divinities prevents spells from having effects that extend from Autochthonia to other realms of existence and vice versa, rendering many summoning spells useless until that barrier falls.
   Apostates who have defiled their Man-Machine Weaving Engine may also install this submodule into a God-Machine Weaving Engine (see p. 170), expanding their spellcasting options as though they knew the Charm Celestial Circle Sorcery or Labyrinth Circle Necromancy. The choice must be made at the time the submodule is purchased and forgoes the alternative path. The process of learning and casting second circle spells otherwise follows the same rules as the first circle.</description>

      <description>Upon activation, the Apostate chooses one Charm in his panoply and consigns it to the Void. Regardless of its present location, the target Charm implodes through a rift of torn space and vanishes into Elsewhere. If presently installed, the Charm inflicts one level of lethal damage as it rips itself free by the roots, leaving a vacant Charm Slot that leaks viscous ichor like a suppurating wound. Successive use of the Charm can banish any number of the Apostate's Charms.
   The secondary mode of this Charm reverses its primary function, summoning a banished Charm and violently cramming it into an empty Charm Slot capable of holding it. Insertion also inflicts a level of lethal damage to the Alchemical. Uninstalling Hideous Void Panoply while it has Charms banished returns them in a twitching, gore-spattered pile around him as their mechanisms feebly try to suckle Essence from his body.</description>

      <description>Inappropriate sentiment is disruptive to the routines of the Realm of Brass and Shadow. Lumpen should not be unduly pitied, heretics should not be coddled, and personal sentiments must never be placed above the well-being of god and state.
   This Charm takes the form of a chrome and soulsteel plating surrounding each eye and extending just beyond the edges of their sockets. When charged with Essence, these hard and pitiless surfaces create a hall of mirrors effect in which the victim's reflection joins the flickers of tortured souls that seem to extend to infinity. This Charm may be used to supplement any social attack to erode an Intimacy, provided the Alchemical has a corresponding Augmentation installed for the Attribute used in the attack. If successful, the Intimacy is instantly erased and may not be reestablished for one day by any effect. No roll is necessary to target oneself: The unwanted Intimacy is simply excised, and the Alchemical gains a point of temporary Clarity.</description>

Removing the Intimacy ends the Compulsion.</description>

      <description>This dreadful Charm consists of a set of retractable Soulsteel hooks set into the fingertips, subdermally wired to its prerequisite. The hooks may be extended for use or retracted by "drawing" them as weapons without activating the Charm. When drawn, the hooks cease to be internal and have the traits of tiger claws with the Piercing tag. When Transcendent Brutality Programming is activated to enhance attacks made with its physical components, however, the hooks become terrible instruments of torture and will breaking. If the attack hits, the target loses one Willpower regardless of damage and suffers a cumulative -1 external penalty to her player's next roll for the character to regain Willpower from sleep. Once this penalty exceeds her dice pool, the player gets no roll for the character to recover Willpower at all. If the victim has no Willpower point for the Charm to drain, she temporarily loses a dot of Willpower instead (to a minimum of Willpower 1). Lost dots return at the rate of one per day of restful (i.e., non-penalized) sleep.</description>

An Essence 5+ Apostate can even apply these effects to an Essence user, provided the victim's will is already broken and her Essence is not higher than his own.</description>

      <description>A set of micropumps and artificial glands implanted beneath the Exalt's skin allow her to synthesize and exude psychoactive biochemical fragrances that accentuate particu-lar emotions. Any social attack the Alchemical makes against a target within (Appearance x 10) yards that is intended to induce a particular emotion or take advantage of the target's emotional state by inducing appropriate behavior costs an additional Willpower to resist. Such attacks are also unnatural mental influence against mortals. Examples include induc-ing lust and then seducing the target, or inducing rage and inciting violence. For the base effects of instilling a feeling, see the accompanying sidebar. Characters with this Charm installed are immune to all uses of it and treat activations as Obvious to their senses while in range of the chemicals.
   Alternatively, the Alchemical may use this Charm to mask her own scent entirely. Doing so causes mundane attempts to track the Alchemical via scent to automatically fail and adds bonus dice equal to the character's Essence to the roll-off against contesting magic that depends on the Alchemical's scent.</description>

Mortals are less affected, suffering a one-die internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions if they don't resist.</description>

         <description>The Exalt can distill a specific emotion into a single gelatinous pill as an alternative to normal activation. This pill emerges from a port just below the Exalt's stomach and retains its potency for one month. Anyone who consumes the capsule gets the benefit of the Charm as though she activated it but can only apply the one emotion. Alternatively, the Exalt can create a pill that makes the consumer vulnerable to all social attacks using the specific emotion as though in range of the Charm for the rest of the scene. These Poison effect pills cannot be tasted or smelled by human-range senses when dissolved into beverages. Doses do not stack in either case, and both types of pills are worth Resources••• apiece.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a series of Essence-draining soulsteel coils linking the Exalt's Essence reservoir and her throat, interspersed with red Jade filtration baffles. While this device is installed, the Alchemical may pay an extra two-mote surcharge when invoking any Social Attribute Augmentation or Social-keyword Charm to make it non-Obvious to mortal witnesses and prevent any Essence spent on it from adding to her anima banner display. Essence users see through the illusion and recognize Obvious Charms as such. Mortals expressly cannot pay Willpower to overcome this perfect illusion. The Storyteller should allow these benefits to apply to any purely social effects from Charms that are not listed as Social.</description>

      <description>This Charm constitutes a spike mounted in one of the Alchemical's limbs, which can be extended or retracted at any time with a miscellaneous action to draw or ready a weapon. The probe may be stabbed into a victim as a stiletto (Speed 5, Accuracy +2, Damage +3L, Defense +0, Rate 3, Tags P) or inserted without damage into a willing or restrained subject (including those held in a clinch). The spike is not intended to serve as a weapon, however, but rather as an instrument of mind control.
   The Charm may be invoked on Step Ten when the Exalt damages or harmlessly pierces a being of equal or lower Essence. Once inserted, the spike releases hundreds of Essence-sculpted microscopic automata that rapidly thread their way through nerve bundles to the spine and up into the brain. The Exalt immediately attempts to force his victim into a mindscape. This is resolved as a roll to control a clinch, but the Exalt uses her ([higher of Manipulation or Wits] + Presence) as the attacking dice pool, resisted by the victim's (Wits + Integrity).
   If the Exalt wins, she may deploy only the psychic equivalent of a hold action, forcing the victim into an empty mindscape marred only by his own psyche and a vague awareness of the Alchemical's presence. Physically, a victim trapped within his own mind is considered Inactive as though held in a standard clinch. If the victim wins, he may only break the clinch, pushing the spike harmlessly out of his body. The invading automata then denature into raw Essence.
   The Alchemical's player continues to make this roll on each subsequent action until the victim breaks the psychic clinch or the Alchemical chooses to retract the spike. She may take no other actions while holding a target's mind hostage with this Charm.</description>

      <description>This Charm expands its prerequisite, allowing the Alchemical the option of either "holding" or "crushing" a victim drawn into a mindscape when in control of the psychic clinch. "Crush" attacks constitute a form of unnatural mental influence costing one Willpower to resist. Resisting this influence merely assures the integrity of the victim's personality for a few more moments and does not end the clinch.
   If the victim fails to fight off the probe's intrusion, the Alchemical may modify his personality to be more agreeable. She may apply one of the following modifications on each "crush" action and wastes any action spent attempting an impossible change:
   Intimacies: One Intimacy of the Alchemical's choice may be added, up to his normal limit. Alternatively one Intimacy of the target's choice is removed as an Illusion effect, and the Alchemical learns what Intimacy was erased.
   Memory: The victim can be made to forget a specific contiguous period of memory covering as much as five years or all memories associated with an Intimacy the Charm has excised. The Exalt does not learn the details of the memories she deletes. This is an Illusion effect.
   Virtues: Any of the victim's Virtues may be increased or decreased by one dot. This cannot shift them above 5 or below 1.
   Willpower: The victim gains or loses a dot of permanent Willpower (maximum 8, minimum 1).
   When the Exalt is finished, the spike slides painlessly free. The effects are permanent as applied to mortals, who can recover lost dots of Virtues or Willpower by spending the requisite experience and a month per dot to heal their torn psyches. Essence users can pay four Willpower at any time to restore a diminished trait to its original rating instead and can pay this cost in installments. Adding Virtue or Willpower dots is a Training effect for mortals, but Essence users can choose to apply a Training effect or a one-day temporary boost when they gain a dot. Essence users can recover lost memories by seeking out reminders of them or otherwise spending scenes building an Intimacy to the memory. Once the Intimacy forms, it dissolves as the memory returns.</description>

      <description>This Charm expands its prerequisite, adding the following options to the list of actions the Alchemical may take while crushing a victim's mind:
   Essence Drain: She may drain five motes from the victim, transferring the Essence to her own reservoirs. Stolen motes beyond her capacity to contain crackle in her anima as though she spent them from her Peripheral Essence pool.
   Memory Extraction: She may read the victim's memories, posing a question that is involuntarily answered as the target's mind flashes vignettes of pertinent experiences. If she reads a patch of blank or magically altered memories, she also recognizes them as such but does not gain any insight into what was originally there. Note that "What memories are false?" and "Do you have gaps in your memory?" are valid questions to locate tampering, since the victim's mind knows the answers even if it isn't aware that it does.
   Spirit Absorption: If the victim is a spirit of lesser Essence and has no motes remaining, the Alchemical may force it into a dematerialized state and implode its being through her spike and into her soul. The spirit effectively does not exist while contained in this fashion and cannot be interacted with, save that the Exalt can clinch the spirit using Personality Override Spike and successive Charms as though it were currently pierced for no activation cost. If the spirit wins control of the grapple, it merely buys itself a day in which it cannot be further molested in that fashion. Unless they are being psychically probed, captive spirits are otherwise held in stasis in the same blank mindscape the spike imposes. One can be voluntarily released by extending the spike and spending one mote to force it out, emerging with the same traits as it entered with as modified by any additional psychic trauma inflicted upon it. There is no limit on the number of spirits that can be contained this way, but the death of the Alchemical also permanently kills all her captives.</description>

The spirit absorption feature is also upgraded to permanently transform Autochthonian machine spirits it captures into gremlins as a Shaping effect, provided their will is already broken when the spike consumes them.</description>

      <description>This Charm expands the function of Identity Recalibration Signal, adding the following options to the list of actions the Alchemical may take while crushing a victim:
   Craft Memory: She may alter the victim's memory by dedicating consecutive actions to doing so. One action suffices to make superficial changes, such as "you arrived to work on time today", where in fact the subject had been late to his shift but had not been discovered or reprimanded. Two actions allow gross changes that need not mesh with associative memory continuity. For example, "You Exalted as one of the Anathema this afternoon", where in fact the subject took a nap. Three actions allow one sweeping change that permeates throughout the victim's memory, such as "You were the son of a Dynast", where the subject is a peasant. Four actions allow for the complete rewriting of a segment of memory up to five years long, while five consecutive actions allow the Alchemical to completely reconfigure the victim's life story. Victims confronted with evidence of false memories may spend one Willpower to remember the truth behind them for one scene. Once a victim has spent a total of 10 Willpower this way (or five Willpower if an Essence user), her memories are fully restored. Spending Willpower this way is considered resisting unnatural mental influence.
   Restore Memory: The Alchemical may restore false or deleted memories she has located. She does not have the option of previewing the truth behind such mental alterations before returning them to her patient, although the option of altering them again remains available if they prove inconvenient.</description>

      <description>This Charm expands its prerequisite, adding the following option to the list of actions the Alchemical may take while modifying a victim:
   Hidden Self: The Alchemical may design a new Motivation and suite of Intimacies, then implant them subliminally into her victim. This new personality will emerge for the duration of one scene at some point in the future, replacing the victim's real Motivation and Intimacies in response to a preset stimulus. Examples of potential stimuli include sunrise on the first day of Calibration, when you receive orders to attack the Lap and upon hearing someone ask if it snows often in the summer. The victim must be aware of a stimulus in order to react to it. In the preceding example, the effect would not trigger at dawn on the first day of Calibration if the victim were locked in a lightless oubliette without a calendar. It takes one action to design the new personality, one to set an appropriate trigger and one to implant it. Victims have an opportunity to spend four Willpower to resist the effect when it triggers.</description>

It emits a corrosive subliminal pulse when triggered, tipping popular opinion away from an agenda the Exalt opposes. This Charm functions identically to Taboo Inflicting Diatribe (see Exalted, p. 238) with the following exceptions:
   It may only be used to encourage the rejection of a current Intimacy within the group's current Policy. The targeted Intimacy is removed and cannot be favorably reimplemented as part of the group's Policy until its leader spends a total of six Loyalty to allow the rebuilding of that Intimacy to begin. Only one Loyalty can be spent in this manner per day.</description>

      <description>Policy can easily be modified by slight changes in definition, resulting in the cascade realignment of a society. An adamant-and-crystal helix woven through the logic centers of the Exalt's brain contains a vast syntactic database, allow-ing her to easily link together disparate concepts to present any necessary justification for social reorganization. This Charm functions identically to Taboo Inflicting Diatribe (see Exalted, p. 238) with the following exceptions:
   It may be used only to change the definition of one of the targeted social group's Intimacies to a similar but different Intimacy of the Champion's choice. This change cannot be a direct inversion of the targeted Intimacy (Lookshy cannot be made to switch from having a friendly Intimacy toward Marukan to harboring a hostile one), but it may otherwise constitute any change as long as at least one element remains in common with the original Intimacy. For example, House Mnemon's subsidiary agenda of "promoting and supporting the Immaculate Order" might become an agenda to "modernize the dogma of the Immaculate Order to favorably incorporate Autochthonia into its mythology". The recalibrated agenda remains part of the group's Policy until its leader spends a total of six Loyalty promoting a return to fundamentalist values in order to restore it. Only one Loyalty can be spent in this manner per day.</description>

      <description>Despite its usefulness, an abundance of Clarity makes interaction with less enlightened beings difficult. This Charm was designed to mitigate that problem. It takes the form of a riveted implant in the neck, from which a web of barbed tendrils emerges and stretches taut along the skin to reenter the skull at key anchor points. These tendrils are held in place by means of hooks in the brain. Activating the Charm produces a moment of excruciating pain, there and gone. For the remainder of the scene, the Alchemical ignores all Clarity-based penalties to Compassion or social actions. He receives no opportunity to reduce Clarity as a result of human interaction, however. When the Charm ends, the Exalt gains a point of Clarity for simulating emotions rather than embracing the human condition.</description>

      <description>The Alchemical locks onto a single target she can currently perceive. Through the resonant Essence nodes of this Charm located on her wrists, she imprints an echo of that signature on a single projectile as she fires or throws it. The projectile dissolves into a harmless and intangible Essence bolt, passing through even dematerialized beings on the way to its target. This effect ignores all cover and may even be targeted through walls if the Exalt has some way to perceive a target on the other side. The projectile rematerializes just before striking, so armor affords its usual protection. Artifact weapons teleport back to the Alchemical if they miss.</description>

      <description>This Charm connects its prerequisite(s) to a core of tangled starmetal monofilaments buried in the center of the Exalt's brain. This core autonomously collates and processes sensory data in conjunction with precognitive modeling of future events using Autochthon's Design. Use of Anticipatory Simulation Processor against an unexpected physical attack removes the "unexpected" label and allows normal defense. Against a physical attack the character can see coming, the Charm instead negates all onslaught or coordinated attack penalties associated with the attack. The Charm's base activation cost is two motes, but attackers outside the fate of Creation and the Design of Autochthon add a one-mote surcharge, while mortals apply a one-mote discount.</description>

         <description>Faintly luminous ruby lenses fitted in the Exalt's eye sockets allow him to see heat in place of conventional light, sliding over his eyes like a second eyelid when needed. Switching between normal and thermographic vision is a reflexive action that the Exalt can perform once per action tick. All heat sources appear to glow while in this vision mode, so warm-blooded creatures stand out against cooler backgrounds, but being within (Perception) yards of a powerful radiant heat source at least as hot as a fire blinds an Exalt using thermal vision unless he has flash shutters. The Alchemical cannot see conventional light while using thermographic mode, so he cannot perceive visual data based on color, pigment contrast (i.e., differentiating between shades of the same color) or brightness. This mode also applies a two-die external penalty to the difficulty of all rolls to notice or physically attack anything that is very close in temperature to its surroundings. Storytellers should assess Perception bonuses and penalties to this vision mode at their discretion, taking care to reward creativity on the part of both the Alchemical and his opponents.</description>

         <description>Soulgems attached to living beings or holding a soul light up within a frame of bright, multicolored geometric symbols when viewed by a Champion with this submodule. The palette and orientation of these symbols makes soulgems within (Perception x 10) yards automatically visible to the Exalt's senses, allowing him to perfectly negate all mundane Stealth actions taken by beings with the devices installed. Charm-assisted stealth of any kind renders a character's gem undetectable, as does the (highly illegal) practice of capping soulgems with lead. Absent such shielding, the Exalt ignores intervening matter to see the precise distance and vector to each soulgem in front of him (or all around, with Ultraperipheral Awareness). Once per action tick, he may reflexively analyze a soulgem he can perceive in order to learn its geometric configuration and associated social rank, as well as whether that artifact is presently installed in a living being or housing a disembodied soul.</description>

         <description>An Alchemical with this submodule may reflexively pay one Willpower and commit (10 - Essence) motes to open her eyes to the higher-order truths of the universe for an hour. Using this power causes her eyes to glow brightly in the colors of her anima, inhibiting concealment like a four- to seven-mote Solar anima flare. The implanted adamant lens reveals the glorious symbols and interwoven patterns by which the Great Maker understands and categorizes the universe. Much of this data is incomprehensible to minds so much less advanced than the Primordial's. The small fragment of useful information gleaned duplicates the effects of All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight (see Exalted, p. 222), but the roll to analyze magic uses ([the Alchemical's lowest-rated Mental Attribute] + [lesser of Awareness or Occult]) as its dice pool. A second installation of this submodule downgrades the associated telltale eye glow to the equivalent of a one- to three-mote Solar anima flare.</description>

The Alchemical can see into a person's pocket, observe the individual's skeletal structure or peer all the way through the person and the wall behind him with equal ease. This submodule cannot see through the magical materials unless the Alchemical has Essence 5+, and wards against scrying block this vision regardless of Essence rating.</description>

         <description>The Champion's brain models spatial contours through precision mapping of echoes, allowing vectored analysis sufficient to cancel blindness penalties and bypass visual-only concealment such as smoke or fog. True silence is as "blinding" as true darkness, but such conditions occur only when they are magically imposed. In all other situations, the faint rumble of the Alchemical's Essence-charged physiology generates enough sound, though purely visual data remains undetectable in darkness as per the limitations of the Thermal Vision submodule for Optical Enhancement (see p. 159). Unlike that submodule, Echolocation Navigation Systems functions in addition to other senses rather than replacing them, so the lack of visual data only really matters when the character's sight is obscured in some way. Storytellers should assess Perception bonuses and penalties to this exotic sense at their discretion, taking care to reward creativity on the part of both the Alchemical and his opponents.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a pair of metal nodules in front of each ear, just above the jawbone. Depending on configuration (and the prerequisite Charm selected to build upon), subdermal wires link the devices to the ears or across the cheeks to the nose. Based on design, the Champion can either hear the telltale vibrations and distortions when a scrutinized target speaks a lie or else smell the biochemical signature produced by willful deception. Alchemicals with both prerequisites installed may use either mode of detection at their discretion. This Charm is identical to Judge's Ear Technique (see Exalted, p. 213), save that it gains no bonus to contested effect rolls.</description>

      <description>One of the Champion's eyes is replaced with a remote drone, outwardly identical to his other eye. When this Charm is activated, the eye slides out of its housing and a clearly prosthetic duplicate pushes its way forward from the back of the socket, preserving the Exalt's binocular vision. The disembodied eye unbraids its optic nerve into spindly leg-tendrils ending in needle tips (with the traits listed in the accompanying sidebar). The drone has no volition or memory and must be issued a constant stream of telepathic orders to know where to go and what specific actions to take. Controlling the drone thus requires a diceless miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -2) from the Alchemical each action, relaying the drone's own sensory input back to its creator during that action.
   Absent such control, the drone waits. Wards that block scrying negate this link, and the automaton will automatically retreat out of such fields by the quickest route possible to restore communication. It has an effective transmission range equal to its creator's Essence rating in miles. Ending this Charm or the drone's premature destruction causes it to sublimate into Essence, with a new replacement growing over five hours. Ordering the construct to reflexively reenter into its home socket ends the Charm without imposing a wait time for reactivation. While it exists, the drone acts as an arcane link to its creator.</description>

         <description>The drone has Intelligence 2 and can remember instructions, allowing it to operate without ongoing input. At the start of each action tick, the Alchemical must choose whether to open the link to receive sensory input and potentially transmit new orders. Doing so provides those benefits but also imposes a one-die internal penalty to all of the Chosen's non-reflexive actions until his DV refreshes from the strain of multitasking. Although they are intelligent enough to accept complicated instructions, the drones have no ingenuity or true independent initiative and never do anything they have not been tasked specifically with doing.</description>

         <description>The drone can receive and transmit the Alchemical's voice. Alternatively, it can telepathically broadcast the Exalt's words to anyone touching it, preventing the transmissions from being overheard. Social attacks made this way use the Alchemical's own traits as if he were present at the drone's location, and he may enhance them with his own Charms normally. Unless he possesses the Autonomous submodule, however, he must make those attacks as part of a flurry following an action to control the drone.</description>

Doing so causes the drone to leap into the air and burst into a momentary rip in the Design through which the Apostate teleports. He cannot use this means of travel if there is insufficient space to receive him. Attacks made against him on the tick in which he teleports automatically miss.</description>

   Other Exalted have developed similar powers: Lunar Exalted have a Knack called Terrestrial Bloodline Integration (One complete Celestial martial arts style, Wits 3, Essence 4) that sets their prices at six experience points if Martial Arts is Favored, and eight experience points if not. Solars, Abyssals and Green Sun Princes have a trio of hero style extension Charms: Swallowing the Lotus Root, Blood-Soaked Lotus Root and Root of the Brass Lotus. Sidereals have developed a unique stand-alone Sidereal Martial Arts Charm called Perfected Lotus Mastery. These Charms all reduce the cost of Terrestrial Martial Arts Charms to four experience points if Martial Arts is Favored or six if it isn't, reduce training time for Terrestrial styles by half and require Martial Arts 5, Essence 4 and one complete Celestial martial arts style. Solars and Abyssals additionally require Martial Arts Essence Flow, while Green Sun Princes need any variant of So Speaks (Yozi) and Sidereals must know the Fateful Martial Arts Excellency.</description>

      <description>This bulky Charm fits snugly into the Alchemical's torso, with an assortment of vent tubes branching out to exhaust ports in the Exalt's skin and throat. When activated, the device churns out thick streamers of black smoke from as many of the vents as desired. The smoke billows into heavy clouds, rapidly filling a radius of (Essence) yards per mote spent. Up to a limit of (lower of Stamina or Manipulation) motes may be spent powering the Charm per action. The Stackable keyword permits the Alchemical to fill a progressively greater area with smoke by continuing to burn Essence, with smaller clouds adding their radius to the size of larger clouds with which they merge. The smoke lingers for one hour in still air, half that time in a light breeze, only (Stamina rating) minutes in a strong wind and one action in a hurricane gale. The Storyteller should extrapolate its longevity in other conditions using these guidelines.
   The murky black cloud imposes vision penalties as fog (see Exalted, p. 135), which means that defensive use applies appropriate visual penalties against the incoming attack. Additionally, the caustic, choking smoke acts as a poison to anyone caught within its radius who requires air. Characters holding their breath are unaffected until they are forced to breathe it. As a mild poison, the smoke has the following traits: (1B/1 hour, 2M,  -/ -, -1). Like all inhaled toxins, ongoing smoke inhalation only imposes a new dose every time the previous dose wears off and the victim is still breathing it. This means that initial contact runs its course after two hours, applying damage each hour as normal. After that time, a character still breathing it faces exposure for another two hours of being affected, et cetera.
   Only one gas-based submodule may be applied to any use of the Charm. Mixing gas formulae using separate activations catalyzes the joint cloud into the unmodified smoke, allowing Alchemicals to use this Charm defensively to counter the poison clouds of their enemies.</description>

         <errText>As errata to that Charm, when one dose runs its course, the toxic fog doesn't impose another dose until the poison's interval has passed. Further, the damage for basic smoke and tear gas is 2B/hour and 2B/action, respectively. This means that someone breathing smoke suffers one interval of damage immediately and another after an hour, resolving that first dose. Continued exposure doesn't inflict the second dose until an hour passes.</errText>

         <description>As an alternative to standard smoke, the Charm may release a colorless, odorless gas that is not Obvious. Although this gas does not interfere with vision and has a difficulty equal to the Alchemical's Manipulation to notice with a standard (Perception + Awareness) roll, it is still as toxic as normal. In addition, the toxin does not take effect until characters have been exposed for the full period of one duration interval, though even momentary exposure assures that the toxin will take effect, even if the victim moves out of the gas before that time. In conjunction with other submodules such as Nerve Gas, use of the Clandestine Toxin System can result in enemies not realizing they have stumbled into a deadly atmosphere until it is too late.</description>

Attacking the ground to catch many enemies in the radius is often easier than attacking one of them directly, as the Exalt needs only a single attack success to place the projectile where desired.</description>

Victims who already possess the mutation to its maximum Stackable limits or who cannot acquire that trait are immune to the particular formulation.

      <description>This Charm has two configurations, one of which must be selected at the time of purchase. In its Exoskeletal configuration, a metallic carapace is riveted onto the Alchemical's flesh. It provides +3L/4B soak and +2L/3B Hardness per installation, and is considered armor. This exoskeleton is Obvious, and while artifact armor may always be worn over it for cumulative benefit, mundane protective gear must be specially tailored to accommodate the Exalt. In its Subcutaneous configuration, it takes the form of a fully articulated mesh of dense subdermal plates and is Internal. This mode provides +2L/3B soak and +1L/2B Hardness per installation, and is considered natural soak. Regardless of configuration, Alchemicals may harbor a number of simultaneous installations equal to their Essence and may mix-and-match armor types within this total limit. The first two cost one mote to install, but subsequent installations require no commitment.
   Essence 6+ Alchemicals may support heavier layers of armor and no longer require commitment for the first two installations, adding +3L/4B soak and +2L/3B Hardness per Subcutaneous installation or +4L/5B soak and +3L/4B Hardness per Exoskeletal installation.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a complex brass assembly surrounding the Alchemical's Essence reservoir. Wires connect it to a pentagonal plate mounted on his chest, formed entirely of one of the magical materials and etched with a depiction of the Champion's iconic anima banner. When activated, a flash of Essence washes out of the plate, briefly transforming the Exalt's entire body into a solidified, living mass of his caste's magical material. This momentary perfect invulnerability reduces the raw and final damage of an incoming attack or similar phenomenon to zero after all other modifiers and effects. This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Alchemical Invulnerability.</description>

      <description>When charged with Essence, crystal lattices embedded in the Alchemical's skin sculpt her anima into an impenetrable barrier. This luminous force field obviates stealth at the level of an 8- to 10-mote banner display.
   This mobile barrier adjusts itself to the Alchemical's movements, imposing no penalty on any of her actions. It offers an ongoing protection of 20B/15L/10A Hardness, deflecting all but the mightiest attacks in crackling discharges of Essence. Yet, the first time an attack manages to overwhelm the barrier's Hardness, the Charm involuntarily deactivates itself and can't be reactivated until the Alchemical spends an hour recalibrating his lattice arrays as a diceless dramatic action. This overload occurs only if the barrier is defeated by raw damage, not if a Charm causes an attack to ignore Hardness or by any other such means. The attack that destroys the barrier has its damage completely absorbed.</description>

      <description>The Champion's bones are plated in a magical material appropriate to his caste, with reinforcing wires and struts added to connect all of his major organs and muscle systems. The first time during a scene when the Alchemical suffers sufficient damage to reduce him to Incapacitated or below, this emergency reinforcement system makes it so that he is only reduced to (or remains at) his last -4 health level instead. As it takes time for the system to recalibrate itself after suffering such a violent shock, any further damage within the scene incapacitates the Exalt as normal.</description>

This immunity does not remove the need for sleep and is temporarily disabled after the Exalt has gone more than 25 hours without a full night of sleep (or equivalent unconscious rest). Sufficient sleep recharges the immunity.</description>

      <description>Hidden compartments scattered across the Alchemical's body hide colonies of thumbnail-sized automata shaped roughly like metallic spiders. When these bays are opened and fed a charge of Essence, the colonies awaken. Hundreds or even thousands of tiny machines swarm out across the Exalt's body, clustering around any wounds they find. The automata work quickly and tirelessly, spinning strands of unformed Essence that congeal into new matter. Where the spiders pass, they leave flesh and Charms restored to pristine condition.
   While this Charm is active, the Exalt heals two levels of bashing damage per action tick. Once all bashing damage is mended, he regenerates a level of lethal damage each action tick instead. Amputated or destroyed limbs and organs may be reconstructed with this Charm, although doing so takes an hour per Crippling effect removed and prevents standard regeneration during this time. Amputated Charms and limbs disintegrate as the Body-Reweaving Matrix replaces them. This Charm may be activated while unconscious or otherwise inactive.</description>

         <description>The Charm can repair other living beings, magitech automata and inanimate objects as an alternative to healing the Champion, though this can only repair damage and cannot reconstruct amputated organs. Every hour of total concentration and unbroken physical contact with the subject heals one level of bashing or lethal damage. Patients do not bleed or continue to die if mortally wounded while undergoing treatment.Pattern Restoration System: The Charm can also remove unwanted Shaping effects and mutations imposed by such effects as if they were a form of amputation. Gremlin Syndrome cannot be cured this way.</description>

      <description>The Alchemical possesses a set of subdermal ports abutting every major joint. When activated, blunt-tipped screws extend from every port, pushing against or directly connecting with any armor she may be wearing. This process requires five minutes spent motionless, as the screws pivot in their ports and calibrate the best possible alignment to turn the Alchemical's protective attire into an effective second skin. Any substantial motion during this period spoils the Charm, forcing it to be invoked anew. Afterward, for as long as she continues to wear the armor and commit Essence, the Exalt reduces its mobility penalty and fatigue value by two each (or completely if the armor is non-magical).</description>

The doors of the shrine open when this Charm is active, sending tiny divinities scurrying throughout the Champion's body.
   The Alchemical is immune to new Sickness effects while enjoying the benefits of this Charm and suffers no ill effect from any Sickness he might currently harbor. Additionally, he adds three automatic successes to all attempts to overcome illnesses afflicting him. The bonus also applies to anyone's efforts to treat his illnesses.</description>

      <description>The Exalt's body is optimized to endure one of the six elements native to the Machine God, affording immunity to environmental damage. At the time of purchase, the Alchemical gains one of the following elemental submodules for free. Each elemental submodule requires a separate Charm activation to bring online, but the cost of each concurrent activation past the first is only two motes. The Charm may be activated while unconscious or otherwise inactive.
   In aggregate, this Charm is comprehensive. All environmental threats fall under the header of some submodule, with specific assignment of categorically vague hazards falling to the discretion of the Storyteller. When another character deliberately causes or uses environmental effects with intent to harm the Alchemical, this Charm does not protect her.</description>

         <description>As long as the Champion has exactly one elemental permutation active, the Charm provides immunity to damage from non-magical attacks that fit within its scope of protection. An attack is magical if enhanced by a Charm or other Essence power, if it uses an inherently magical weapon or if the attacker has Essence 4+. If the Exalt changes which permutation is active through reactivation, this submodule temporarily overloads and provides no benefit for the rest of the scene.</description>

      <description>Control valves affixed to the Alchemical's Essence reactor allow him to power down and enter a highly restorative torpor. The Exalt's biological processes slow down and then cease to function. Those familiar with Alchemical physiology will, of course, realize the Exalt is not dead when he fails to melt down, unless he has assumed a human disguise, whereupon he looks like a dead human being.
   The character remains in a state of torpor for a period specified when he activates this Charm. He may be awakened in the interim only if he is violently struck or damaged. Time spent comatose is highly restful, and the Exalt divides the amount of time required for a full night's sleep by his Essence. (Thus, an Essence 4 Exalt will be fully rested and refreshed in two hours). Torpor does not accelerate Essence respiration beyond the normal rate for sleep, and the character may benefit from only one Conviction roll to regain Willpower in a 25-hour period.</description>

      <description>A small reactor connects the Alchemical's Essence reservoir and stomach, while implanted green Jade recycling baffles optimize metabolic function. The Exalt no longer produces any form of waste matter and needs to consume only one pound of organic matter per day to remain healthy, gaining the capability to digest any matter he eats without risk of associated Poison, Sickness or other deleterious effects. At Essence 5+, the Alchemical may sustain himself purely on respired Essence.
   A secondary function of this Charm allows the Exalt to bleed a nutrient paste from a vein port on his inner forearm by reflexively spending five motes. This bland, gray sludge contains a balanced set of nutrients, capable of sustaining a person for a day. This function of the Charm is Obvious.</description>

      <description>This Charm is housed as a set of reinforcing components and Essence capacitors in the lower legs. When activated, the device allows the Alchemical to twist gravity's pull in one of two ways. Each mode of the Charm must be activated separately if the two are to function concurrently.
   In the primary mode, the Exalt controls the orientation of "down" in relation to himself. Doing so allows the character to walk or run along any surface that would be capable of bearing his weight if it were down, including walls and ceilings. Moving the soles of his feet more than (Essence) yards from a surface results in gravity reassuming its normal properties but does not end the Charm, allowing all manner of improbable acrobatics such as somersaulting off of a wall to land on the ceiling.
   In its secondary mode, the Champion gains the ability to reduce his weight to as little as 15 percent of normal. Doing so permits the Exalt to move at double his normal movement rate and jump twice as far, but it also doubles penalties due to high wind, doubles knockback distance and imposes whatever other effects the Storyteller deems appropriate for the change in weight.</description>

         <description>By paying five motes when activating the Charm, an Exalt with this submodule telepathically broadcasts autonomic telemetry impulses and gravity inhibitor waves in a radius of 10 yards for the Charm's duration as a Shaping effect. These signals disorient those who mean the Alchemical any harm, imposing a -2 internal penalty to all Athletics actions and a -1 internal penalty to non-reflexive actions using other abilities. Friendly and neutral characters in range benefit from the usual effects of Gyroscopic Stability System and may substitute the Alchemical's Essence rating for their own for the purposes of calculating their Dodge DV.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a series of Essence-injection nozzles fed into its prerequisite. When activated, it allows the Exalt to take a reflexive Jump action, even if she is in midair at the time. The character can extend the length of an ordinary jump, change direction in midair, arrest his momentum while falling (effectively resetting the distance fallen at the time of the Charm's use) or break a flurry as in Leaping Dodge Method (see Exalted, p. 227). In the latter case, the effect is considered a special counterattack. This Charm may be activated only once per action.</description>

      <description>The Exalt has a pair of heavily shielded nozzles mounted in the soles of his feet or in a retractable mechanism on his back. Regardless of their placement, the Charm has the same effect, propelling the Alchemical through the air at great speed on jets of glowing force. The Champion can carry up to one passenger of approximately the same size as himself, or an equivalent amount of cargo.
   The Exalt can accelerate in a straight line, moving (Essence x 50) yards in a single burst once per action. Doing so normally costs two motes. If the Exalt uses this burst on an action tick to close the distance to an enemy and strike her with a close combat attack for added force, the cost increases to four motes and one Willpower and doubles the raw damage of that attack. In conjunction with a flurry, only the first attack may be enhanced this way. The character may also use the burst to fly a grappled enemy and slam her into a solid barrier for four motes and one Willpower, doubling the raw damage of a crush attack. As a defense, enemies can always get in a strike before the Exalt can take off, or even a flurry of attacks. Yet, each attack after the first in a flurry suffers a -2 external penalty from the Alchemical pulling away and thereby lessening the impact.
   Alternatively, the Charm allows for long-distance travel, costing 10 motes per hour of flight, or five motes if the Alchemical has some version of the Wings mutation installed to help keep him aloft. The Exalt travels at (Essence x 20) miles per hour, and any fine maneuvering requires a reflexive (Dexterity + Athletics) roll with a difficulty of 1-5 as set by the Storyteller for the type of maneuver and environmental conditions. Combat or other highly distracting physical activity aborts this travel mode and deactivates the Charm.
   Everyone within one yard directly behind or beneath the Alchemical when he engages any mode of this Charm suffers automatic knockdown unless the character has a Dodge DV of 5+. Launching straight up affects everyone around the launch point.</description>

         <description>The Alchemical's flight system does not shut off when the character enters combat. The character still moves at full speed (40 yards per tick), though, and must plan accordingly, especially as crashing as a result of a failed maneuver roll results in a terminal velocity impact for 25B. The character gains the usual combat advantages of flight. The Champion can even use the Charm's burst mode while aloft to provide quick acceleration for that mode's usual purposes.</description>

      <description>The artificial bodies of the Alchemical Exalted are not limited to merely superhuman feats of Essence-driven prowess. This Charm is actually a vast multitude of different biomechanical implants, represented by purchasing mutations in bundled packages. Many of these packages, having been selected again and again over the centuries by Autochthonia's industrial Champions, have developed discrete names and identities as Charms. The (double installation of Tentacles)package, for example, comprises a bundle of telescoping or moonsilver limbs attached to hardpoints in the Alchemical's back and sides and is commonly known as the Hyperdexterous Tentacle Apparatus.
   Each purchase of this Charm produces a bundle of eight mutation points and must be installed separately. If any mutations in the package substantially alter the humanoid structure of the Alchemical's body (i.e., having one head, two arms and two legs conventionally arranged from a central torso), that installation has Exemplar 1, and the Storyteller is final arbiter of this. Mutations acquired via this Charm are always Obvious in some way and remain active at all times. All mutations acquired with this Charm must have a mechanical appearance and rationale appropriate to the aesthetics of Alchemical Charms, as approved by the Storyteller. Claws could be installed as whirling drill bits or vibrating saws, hooves as reinforced piston feet, et cetera. The Alchemical is free to concurrently install as many iterations of this Charm as his Essence reserves can sustain.</description>

      <description>The modularity of Alchemical Charms is at once the greatest strength and greatest limitation of Autochthon's Champions. While they can expand the breadth of their competence quite cheaply compared to their cousins in Creation and can optimize themselves for specific missions, they remain completely dependent on vats access to employ these strengths. They must also carefully ration limited Personal Essence reserves among installation costs to determine how many Charms they can install at once.
   Unlike most Alchemical Charms, a Transorganic Desecration Cyst doesn't require vats access to acquire. If the Exalt is willing to pursue power at any cost, her player can decide that this desire catalyzes as an unnatural growth in the Exalt's brain or Essence reservoir over the course of three days (equal to the Charm's minimum Attribute requirement). "Learning" the Charm costs 14 experience points (or 12 experience points with Stamina Favored) and does not use up a Charm slot or require any installation cost. Because it is not installed, the cyst can't be removed or otherwise swapped out, which means characters gain permanent Gremlin Syndrome along with the Charm if they don't already have that mutation. The Storyteller must approve the acquisition of this Charm.
   Once an Alchemical has this Charm, she can grow any other Alchemical Charms using the same rules and experience costs as acquiring this Charm. Such Charms can't be removed and have no installation cost, but non-Internal Charms grown this way show the perverse aesthetics of mechanized wickedness that defines Voidtech. The Alchemical's player should work out specific descriptions of this degradation with the Storyteller. Charms gained this way grow into place with all submodules the character has already purchased for them. The Exalt can also spend a day and the usual experience to grow a new submodule out of a transorganic Charm. Extruded Voidtech can't be grown into an Array, but Apostates may develop standard Combos as other Exalted types do.
   Enlightened Jadeborn and non-Alchemical Exalted may acquire this Charm and can grow other Alchemical Charms with submodules, paying the Eclipse caste anima power rate of 16 experience points per Charm and twice the listed cost for submodules. Non-Alchemicals must have visited Autochthonia or otherwise been in the immediate presence of the Great Maker or a component subgod for any chance of infection by a Transorganic Desecration Cyst. Damaged magitech artifacts of Autochthonian origin may also carry traces of the taint at Storyteller discretion, infecting those who try and fail to repair them.</description>

         <description>Alchemicals with this submodule may also increase their Attributes or Essence without needing vats access, bypassing these limitations through defiance of established patterns. Alchemicals using this submodule must spend the same time as such upgrades would require with vats access, during which their bodies rest unconscious within a cocoon of tumors and wire that adds +5B/5L natural soak while the change goes on. The Exalt cannot prematurely awaken in the face of injury, so Void Lords must choose their lairs carefully when planning upgrades. Non-Alchemicals can already grow these traits on their own and do not need this submodule.</description>

All mutations acquired this way must clearly express the twisted aesthetics of Voidtech.

      <description>An Integrated Genesis System is nothing less than a miniaturized, functional womb-sarcophagus. An Alchemical must be female (or at the very least hermaphroditic) to install this Charm, though the Husk-Sculpting Apparatus (see pp. 155-156) makes this a fairly trivial hurdle to overcome. This biomechanical womb may be used as a fully stocked, mobile Craft (Genesis) lab that supplies all tools within its functions, though it is can be more modest as a means of overcoming innate Alchemical sterility. When a pregnant Alchemical's anima flares at or above the 8- to 10-mote level, the nutrient broth in her womb-sarcophagus becomes bioluminescent, shining through her skin to reveal the shadowy outline of whatever grows within.
   Any children born to an Alchemical are magically created life forms, not a new type of Half-Caste. Due to size restrictions, only infant-sized creatures may be grown in an Integrated Genesis System until the Exalt reaches Essence 6+. Uninstalling this Charm kills any life form it might currently be incubating. For more details on Craft (Genesis), see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. I - Wonders of the Lost Age.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a Soulsteel-capped piston ringed with Essence injection vents in one of the Alchemical's limbs. Upon making a close combat attack with the selected limb, the piston may be triggered with a terrible whistling shriek of steam and an explosive bang. Successes on the supplemented attack roll are counted twice for the purpose of determining raw damage, or three times if attacking unarmed.</description>

         <description>Whenever an attack enhanced by that Charm inflicts three or more levels of non-bashing damage, the Apostate may inflict an amputation wound on the target (see Exalted, p. 152 for examples). Doing so with a close combat attack allows the Apostate to rip the organ out and stuff it into his distended mouth, restoring four motes. Organs ripped from corpses offer no nourishment, so a killing attack offers only one feeding opportunity. If the enhanced attack mortally wounds or kills an animate being, its body and Essence shreds into a smoking mass of gore that leaves only indestructible possessions intact. Such death is permanent for spirits.</description>

      <description>A blue Jade and orichalcum dynamo is installed in the Alchemical's back, with conductor nodes riveted into various chakra points across his body. Upon activation, the Exalt may choose to charge his body with electricity quickly or slowly. A fast activation (Speed 3) is Obvious, as the Champion's body hums and crackles with arcs and blasts of lightning in hues characteristic of his anima. A slower activation (Speed 6) is normally imperceptible without Essence sight, but temporarily reveals itself by flash boiling any small quantities of water that contact the Alchemical, such as rain drops. Actual immersion or other significant water contact involuntarily deactivates the Charm and prevents reactivation.
   In either event, the charge remains until the Alchemical next touches an animate being or the scene ends, whichever comes first. Upon discharge, the electrical surge inflicts 1L or 2B per mote spent activating it, up to a maximum of (Strength) motes. If the Alchemical initiates contact, this damage is applied and soaked independently of any other damage he might inflict with an unarmed attack, following the damage of the attack. Non-magical metallic armor offers no protection. If the target touches the Alchemical, resolve the discharge as an unblockable, undodgeable counterattack that automatically hits in Step Nine without a roll and inflicts only the paid-for surge damage. This counterattack can respond to other physical counterattacks, but not other instances of this Charm's effect.</description>

      <description>This Charm takes the form of a pair of spherical crystal capacitors mounted in the Alchemical's shoulders. When charged with Essence, the crystals flash brightly in a color characteristic of the Exalt's anima before emitting a thunderclap and a torus of expanding force. All objects and individuals of approximately the same or smaller size than the Alchemical within a radius of (Strength + Essence) yards blasts back to the edge of the effect. Characters blasted back suffer a three-die internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions from the stunning force of the wave until the Alchemical's next action and drop all held weapons and items if they are extras. On top of this Crippling effect, victims without superhuman balance also fall prone automatically. The Champion is unaffected by the blast he emits.</description>

         <description>If the Alchemical pays an extra Willpower, the Charm's energy burst is also superheated. The entire radius of effect can be spotted from 10 miles away barring obstruction and blazes as a white-hot bonfire of smoldering plasma (see Exalted, p. 131), burning victims caught in its energy once before they are hurled to the smoking edges. These flames last a minute before going out, though objects taken outside the radius immediately cease burning. Once ignited, the fire will not burn the Champion or his personal possessions until his next action, giving him a chance to escape unscathed. Hardier Alchemicals may use the burning zone as a sniper nest.</description>

Increase the Essence drain to five motes if the entire radius of effect is already a blight zone, in which case there are no lingering effects as the two zones seamlessly merge.</description>

      <description>A space-folding storage assembly is implemented into the Alchemical's arms (and possibly his legs, as well), allowing for nigh-unlimited weapon storage. At the time of purchase, this Charm grants the Champion two mundane close-range or projectile-launching weapons - so a crossbow or spear-thrower would be valid options, but throwing knives or chakrams would not. (This Charm does not provide ammunition for such weapons). These weapons deploy in response to the Alchemical's will, unfolding from ports in his arms and hands to immediately spring to action, or disassembling and folding to unobtrusively disappear when violence is no longer deemed necessary. In effect, the Charm permits reflexive actions to draw or ready integrated weapons.
   These weapons are physically attached to the Exalt's body and, as such, cannot be loaned to other characters. They also make it impossible to disarm the Exalt without an amputation effect. Amputated weapons may be replaced with an hour's work at the vats but otherwise require a week to regenerate on their own. Players and Storytellers are encouraged to adjust the appearance of weapons to reflect an industrial motif - wrist-mounted steel cable whips and whirling fist-mounted drills acting as khatars are entirely appropriate.
   Additional weapons may be purchased one at a time as submodules for one experience point each.</description>

      <description>Psychoreactive crystalline structures are laced throughout the Alchemical's skeleton. Upon suffering a Crippling effect that inflicts an amputation, the Alchemical may pay one Willpower to charge this telekinetic array, forcing it to hold his body together. Visible flickers and bolts of crackling violet Essence will hold a limb or organ in place, even if it has been completely severed from the body, until the Exalt's superior healing reattaches it in a more lasting manner. The Exalt also does not bleed.</description>

      <description>Coils of Essence-conducting wire entwine the Exalt's fingers on both hands, just beneath the skin. When fueled with Essence, the Charm becomes able to generate or dismiss a field of semi-palpable force visible as a faint distortion on the air. This field extends as a flexible ray with a maximum range of (Strength x 10) yards, congealing over any object it strikes as directed by the Alchemical's stylized gestures. While the Charm remains active, the beam can be retargeted as appropriate to actions using it.
   This beam may be used to remotely manipulate inanimate objects with a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -1), substituting the Alchemical's Essence for Strength and Dexterity. It provides three automatic successes on all attempts to recall loose weapons or hurled projectiles, and may be used to make disarm attempts at range. The beam is also useful for various acrobatic feats, including swinging along ceilings from place to place, hanging suspended from a tether beam and even "winching up" the intangible grapple line. Other stunts may be possible at the Storyteller's discretion.</description>

      <description>This terrible Charm is one of the most feared in Autochthonia, to the point of perhaps qualifying as the signature abomination invented by the servants of the Void. It fits into an Alchemical's torso, replacing her ribs with a larger cage that rests at the surface of the skin. On command, these artificial ribs gape wide, revealing their segmented flexibility and the terrible serrated cutting instruments that adorn them.
   This Charm may be used upon only a restrained Alchemical Exalt, requiring that they be unconscious, tied down or held in a clinch. The Apostate's ribs attach themselves to a selected Charm (which the Dissonant Exalt must be aware of) and attempt to saw it free from the target's body. This takes the form of a contested roll of (the Apostate's Strength + Martial Arts) against (the target's Stamina + Resistance). In the event of a tie or failure, the target suffers one level of lethal damage but retains her Charm. If the attacker wins, the target Charm is ripped from the Alchemical's living body, inflicting two levels of unsoakable lethal damage.
   A forest of miniature armatures at the base of the Transference Mechanism's artificial ribs reach out and guide the stolen Charm to an appropriate open Charm Slot on the attacker's body (without such a Slot available, this Charm may not be activated). The Apostate's flesh ripples and bubbles around the stolen implant as it forcibly reorders the Charm to harmonize with its new owner, often causing crystal components to crack and brass elements to tarnish from negative harmonic feedback.
   The stolen Charm now belongs to the Apostate as a Training effect. If the victim wishes to replace the missing Charm, she must commission the creation of a new copy but does not need to spend experience since her soul is intimately familiar with the stolen template. Because Alchemical Charms break down almost immediately upon death, this gristly magic may be worked only upon a living target.Perfected Lotus Matrix and the Weaving Engine Charms are not valid targets for this Charm.</description>

The Alchemical may prepare a single activation of his Precalculated Evasion System in advance, at whatever would be the proper cost given desired submodule enhancements. Preparing the later activation counts as a Charm activation, but discharging the perfect dodge at a later time of the Exalt's choosing does not. The motes spent activating the Charm remain committed until the Alchemical discharges her stored defense. Only Instant-duration invocations of the Charm may be stored.</description>

         <description>Starmetal calculation nodes installed along the Alchemical's legs and spine house a distributed processing system, allowing him to calculate and execute split-second escape routes with flawless precision. Omnisituational Evasive Equation can be used to defend against any environmental hazard or attack with an area of effect. Undodgeable attacks and hazards lose that quality against this defense, and the Alchemical may apply his Dodge DV in automatic successes against the Trauma of a hazard rather rolling (Stamina + Resistance).
   Successfully dodging an area attack or reducing the damage of an environmental hazard to 0 with this Charm allows the Alchemical to reflexively move to the nearest safe edge of the effect in Step 9 if one exists within (Essence x 50) yards. Using a perfect dodge also triggers this evasion.</description>

      <description>The Alchemical has two pairs of retractible tendrils coiled in ports mounted on his forearms and inner calves. When he activates this Charm while piloting an artifact vehicle, these needle-tipped tentacles extend and interface directly with the essence-powered workings of the vehicle, letting the Champion bypass the need for physical controls. While directly interfaced into the ship or vehicle, the Alchemical can make piloting rolls to control it as a reflexive action, and adds +2 to the Maneuverability of the vehicle. The Alchemical can still take actions normally without it interfering with his control of the vehicle, but moving from the spot where he activated the Charm (as with a Move or dash action) forcibly disconnects the tendrils of this Charm, causing it to deactivate.</description>

It enables the Alchemical to interface with living mounts using this Charm (dealing a single level of unsoakable lethal damage as its needles penetrate the flanks of a steed). Interfaced mounts have their Control rating reduced by two instead of receiving a Maneuverability bonus, to a minimum of control 0. Should the Alchemical wish to interface with an unwilling mount, he must roll (Dexterity + Martial Arts) as an attack to implant the tendrils.</description>

      <description>A gimbaled assembly is installed around the Alchemical's Tunnel-Fighting Tactical Omnibus Implant, allowing for limited prescient situational modeling, assisted by a supplementary connection to the Design of Autochthon. When activated, this Charm allows the Alchemical to more efficiently defend a complementary unit in close formation in which he is a special character. The Champion is a blur, sweeping arrows from the air with his blade or allowing blows intended for terrified soldiers to bounce off his mighty armor. This Charm makes sure that the overwhelming majority of soldiers shed by a unit due to damage or Magnitude loss survive the experience. Their fate is diverted from death to disorganization or flight, allowing them to be collected or rallied for numbers later.
   If this Charm faces a conflicting effect that guarantees that defeated soldiers within the Exalt's unit die, it adds the Alchemical's Compassion in automatic successes to the contested roll.</description>

While active, the Charm quickens all dramatic actions using Attributes for which the character has an Augmentation installed, dividing the time necessary to complete them by (the Alchemical's Essence x 2). While under the effects of this Charm, the Exalt's movements become clipped and mechanical, lacking any organic grace.

      <description>A secondary nervous system is woven through the Exalt's skin, radiating outward from his Dynamic Reaction Enhancement System. This network appears to be an array of circuit-board patterns tattooed onto the Alchemical, which glow while in use.
   When activated, this Charm produces a magical flurry consisting of one full dice pool action per two motes spent, up to a maximum number of actions equal to the Alchemical's Wits. This flurry ignores Rate and uses only the highest Speed value and DV penalty of any action within it. The flurry may be used to perform any sort of action, provided that the action uses an Attribute for which the Alchemical has an Augmentation installed.</description>

      <description>Miniscule orichalcum neurons fire a scrambling signal through the Alchemical's Interpolative Syntax Emulator, momentarily encrypting a language so that he cannot understand it. Activated in response to a spoken or written social attack (or other mental influence conveyed through such media), the Charm acts as a perfect dodge that can't stop undodgeable effects. Effects that guarantee understanding across language barriers or which do not depend upon language also trump this Charm. Once comprehension returns, the Alchemical has encysted the memory to isolate it from the rest of his mind, allowing him to know what was said without any further danger.</description>

      <description>This Charm fits into an Alchemical's hands. Upon activation, the character's hands dissolve into a churning of pulleys, gears, bars and bits to reconfigure themselves on the fly into any combination of tools desired. These utilities range from basic screwdrivers and hammers to advanced Essence calibration devices such as hyperion keys and valgrind couplers. The Alchemical suffers no penalties for crafting without tools and is considered to have access to a master's workshop (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. III - Oadenol's Codex, p. 28). Attempts to use this Charm to produce weapons in combat can manage nothing better than improvised weapons (see Exalted, p. 242) with Damage +0L and Defense +0. The Exalt's player may also enjoy a three-die situational bonus on rolls that could benefit from the use of preci-sion tools, such as lockpicking.</description>

         <description>Taking the form of a set of bulky bracers built directly into the Exalt's arms, this sub-module broadens the Omnitool Implant so that it can produce any surgical tool desired. While the submodule is active, the character takes no penalties for performing medical procedures without proper equipment. Moreover, he can perform surgery without inflicting more than a single level of lethal damage (regardless of the procedure's difficulty or other factors). He also halves the required time for all surgery, adds one automatic success to perform surgery and automatically succeeds on efforts to stanch a patient's bleeding or treat infected wounds (but not other forms of Sickness). A second installation requiring (Intelligence 4, Wits 3) allows him to perform medical treatment procedures that normally take up to an hour using a miscellaneous action. Such an action cannot be part of a flurry. A third installation at (Intelligence 5, Essence 3) allows a five-minute-long procedure to remove any Crippling injury less severe than true amputation. If an Exalt could ultimately heal the wound on her own given enough time, the Comprehensive Surgical Systems can rapidly sew and fuse the tissue together.</description>

      <description>a Complex Assembly Of Alloyed Magical Material Matching the Champion's caste is woven across and throughout most of her body. When charged with Essence, it reconfig-ures itself in a clash of pivoting joints and clicking gears, taking on the form of an artifact-template stored within the Charm. This artifact is directly attached to the Alchemical's body - unless such attachment would obviate its primary use (such as thrown artifacts) - and is impossible to disarm without amputating appropriate portions of the Exalt. Ranged-attack artifacts such as gyroscopic chakrams may be automatically and reflexively drawn back to the Exalt through Elsewhere for one mote. The Transcendent Multimodal Artifact Matrix may take on the form of any artifact, with the following restrictions:
   The artifact's template must be stored in the Charm. The artifact's rating may not be higher than the Alchemical's Essence rating. If the artifact can enjoy a magical material bonus, it must be formed of the Exalt's caste material. The artifact must be either mass-produced or an example of a wide selection of mechanically identical artifacts. (For example, while every daiklave is a unique and storied weapon, all daiklaves share identical base traits and are valid templates for this Charm). Singular or near-singular artifacts such as the Daiklave of Conquest or Flying Silver Dream are not valid. The artifact must not require maintenance or a hearthstone to power it. The artifact must not be designed to consume itself upon use. Finally, the artifact may not be notably larger than the Alchemical.
   This Charm's activation cost is the attunement cost of the desired artifact configuration, or one mote if the artifact does not require attunement. It begins with a single Artifact•• template of the Exalt's choosing. Additional templates are downloaded as submodules from the vats for a cost of three experience points per dot rating of the template.</description>

         <description>The Matrix may be loaded with the templates of a mechanical servant. The cost to deploy such a familiar is two motes per dot rating.

         <description>Templates for artifacts with a Repair rating may be installed, provided they do not have an artifact rating more than (the Alchemical's Essence - 1). If an integrated artifact falls so far behind on maintenance that it would be irreparably damaged, it remains at its current state without further deterioration but does not operate until fixed. Champions with Pattern-Mending Integration installed in a Technomorphic Integration Engine (see pp. 165-166) may use that submodule to repair integrated magitech. Essence 5+ Alchemicals may install miniaturized versions of artifacts normally larger than themselves, provided their function is not intrinsically dependent on their larger size (such as vehicles or warstriders). Miniaturized artifacts function normally, such as a cannon in the arm duplicating a light implosion bow or a storm hammer.</description>

      <description>Six jade cylinders are surgically implanted in the Alchemical's occipital lobe, each one housing a chemical pump filled with synthetic neurostimulants. When the Charm is activated, these chemicals flood the Champion's brain, making time seem to stand still for him as his perception hyper-accelerates. This Charm can enhance any Join Battle, Join Debate, or Join War roll, adding the lower of (Perception or Wits) automatic successes to the roll.
   The Champion's distorted perception of the flow of time allows him to plan out his first move, adding a single additional die to the first attack or social attack he makes in that scene. This bonus is not considered dice from Charms, but dice from Aiming or Monologuing, as appropriate. The Alchemical must make the attack on his first action to receive this bonus.</description>

         <description>The bonus on the Alchemical's first attack increases to two dice. If he received more successes on the initiative roll than any other character, the bonus instead rises to three dice.</description>
