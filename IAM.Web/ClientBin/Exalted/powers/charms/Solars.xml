      <description>Lawgivers with this Charm are known for their moments of brilliance. The Exalt's player can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability. This Charm then adds one die to that roll for each mote spent. This Charm is the paradigmatic dice adder. The rule that Solars are prohibited from increasing a dice pool by more than their (Attribute + Ability) almost always refers to the purchase of dice through the use of this Charm.
   Characters can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability, usually to increase a Defense Value, for example, by increasing (Dexterity + Dodge) to protect against a physical attack. When enhancing static values, her player rolls one die for each mote spent on the First Excellency. Each success increases her effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for the task by two. Therefore, each success on the First Excellency roll increases an applicable static value by one.
   Characters cannot use this or other Excellencies or dice-adding Charms to "create" actions. For example, if a character attacks on tick 3 and will attack again on tick 8, she cannot buy dice for an attack on tick 4 that only exists because she used the Excellency to conjure dice for it. A character who uses this or other reflexive Charms to add to an attack can also use it to enhance her defense until the next tick when she acts, but she must spend Essence for each separate roll she wishes to modify.
   This Charm can be part of a Combo or used together with the Second Excellency, but it is incompatible with the Third Excellency. It can never be used on the same roll as the Third Excellency.

      <description>Solar Exalted with this Charm are known for their unwavering perfection. The Exalt's player can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability. The Exalt then spends up to (Attribute + Ability) in motes. This Charm adds one success to a roll for every two motes spent. Each success purchased with Essence Triumphant is the equivalent of purchasing two dice with the First Excellency or some other dice adder. Therefore, if a Solar had a (Dexterity + Melee) total of 8, he could purchase up to four successes with the Second Excellency. Any magical effects that hinge on the character buying dice will then react as if the character had just bought eight (Dexterity + Melee) dice. The character could not add dice from the effects of other Charms because he has reached his maximum of eight by purchasing the four successes.
   The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. Each two motes spent increases his effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for one task by two. This means that every two motes spent on this Excellency increase a static value like a DV by one. The First Excellency is thus considerably more efficient for increasing static values than the Second Excellency, but not reliably so.
   This Charm can be Comboed or used together with the First Excellency, but it is incompatible with the Third Excellency, and it can never be used on the same roll as the Third Excellency.

      <description>Exalted with this Charm recover smoothly from failure. An Exalt's player can invoke this Charm after making a roll based on the relevant Ability. This Charm allows her player to make the roll again, using the new result if the Exalt prefers it. The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance static values derived from the relevant Ability. Doing so increases the character's effective (Attribute + Ability) rating for one task by the Ability rating. This means that the Essence Resurgent Excellency increases an applicable DV by half the relevant Ability.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted are infinite wells of talent. Each two motes committed to this Charm reduces the mote cost for the first three (Ability) Excellencies by one, to a minimum of 0. Exalted with Essence 3 can spend up to six motes on this Charm, while Exalted with Essence 4+ can spend as many motes as they like.
   Example: A character with Infinite Melee Mastery, a Melee of 4, a Dexterity of 4 and an Essence of 3 could commit up to six motes to the Charm. This would reduce the cost of any given Melee Excellency by three motes. While the character is technically using a Charm for the purposes of Combos, she could gain up to three bonus dice from the First Excellency on any action using Melee at a cost of 0 motes. She could buy one success with the Second Excellency at no cost in motes or reduce the cost of the Third Excellency to one mote.
   She could also gain one die with the First Excellency if the First and Second Excellencies were together in a Combo she had activated (see p. 244). Any additional effect - adding more dice or more success - would cost the normal price. So, the example character could purchase up to eight bonus dice using the First Excellency and apply a three-mote discount to the total cost, so buying the maximum eight dice would cost five motes.
   Apply the discount to the total expenditure on Excellencies relating to a given roll. A character who spends motes on the Comboed effects of the First and Second Excellencies does not receive the discount for the use of both Excellencies on a given roll. If the example character activated a Combo and spent four motes to buy two successes on a roll with the Second Excellency and four motes to buy four dice using the First Excellency, the cost would be five motes ([4 + 4] - [3 for the six motes committed to the Infinite Melee Mastery]).
   This Charm and the relevant discount are incompatible with any effect that invokes the effects of Excellencies as innate powers rather than as Charms. A character must have the Excellency in order to invoke it at a discount through the use of this Charm.

      <description>The Essence of the Solar Exalted flows through them and brings their intentions and their actions into perfect harmony. Purchasing this Charm allows the Solar to invoke the First, Second and Third Excellencies for the relevant Ability as innate powers rather than Charms. This means that the character can use them even with a Combo that does not contain them or when she has already used a Charm for an action. However, she cannot use them out of place on the order of combat actions (see p. 145), nor may she apply the same Charm repeatedly to a single roll.
   The character must abide by the dice pool maximums as normal. For instance, if a character has a (Dexterity + Melee) of 8, and the player buys four dice through the First Excellency, the player could not use the Second Excellency to buy more than two successes, even if one of those Excellencies was invoked as a natural ability. The Third Excellency remains incompatible with the first two, even if some or all of them are invoked as natural Abilities. The effects are the effects of a Charm used by the character in all ways, save that they can be used with other Charms from the Ability without being placed in a Combo. (See p. 244 for the Combo rules).
   The character must first buy the relevant Excellency to use it with this Charm, but he need not buy this Charm for each Excellency. This Charm is incompatible with any effect that reduces the mote cost of the first three Excellencies. Characters using these Charms as innate powers cannot benefit from any discount.

      <description>This Charm permanently alters the cost of the Solar Excellencies associated with the Ability this Charm is purchased for. The First Excellency's cost becomes "one mote per two dice added", while the Second Excellency's cost becomes "one mote per success added" and the Third Excellency's cost drops to a flat three motes. Fractional values are lost; for example, a Solar with Dexterity 4, Melee 5 who spent five motes on the First or Second Excellency would add nine dice or four successes, respectively. This discount only applies when the Excellency in question is channeled through the appropriate (Ability) Essence Flow. Supreme Perfection of (Ability) is incompatible with any other Charm which provides cost discounts to the Excellencies, such as Infinite (Ability) Mastery.</description>

      <description>All limitations in existence shrink in the face of Solar determination. That which is impossible becomes merely difficult; that which is indestructible crumbles; that which cannot be slain lies dead upon the earth. When a Solar crashes against the boundaries of her own power, that limit also falters. All Charms within the Ability corresponding to this Charm reduce their minimum Ability and Essence ratings by one when the character attempts to learn them. All subsidiary powers contained within such Charms (such as the Archery 6+ damage upgrade of Lambent Bolt of Annihilation) also lower their requisite Ability and Essence ratings by one. For example, if a character learned Divine Transcendence of Linguistics, the Charm Beautiful Essence-Born Rune would drop from minimums of Linguistics 6, Essence 6 to Linguistics 5, Essence 5. Under Divine Transcendence of Melee, all of the repurchase opportunities of Golden Destruction Cut would become available one dot earlier. Divine Transcendence of (Ability) cannot reduce the requirements of any Charm with minimums of (Ability) 10 or Essence 10. Charms retain their original ratings for all other purposes, such as building Combos. Upon achieving (Ability) 10, Essence 10, this Charm vanishes and the Solar is refunded its cost.</description>

      <description>The Solar fires a single perfect shot. The Exalt spends this Charm's cost and fires an arrow at a valid target. This Charm supplements the player's Archery roll and guarantees that the arrow hits. This Charm can be used in archery contests and for trick shots - such as severing a rope from afar - but it is most often used in attacks. Resolve such attacks normally. If the attack would have missed without this Charm, then it hits, calculating its raw damage based on an assumption of 0 attack successes. This Charm does not change the normal rules for valid targets - shooting "the gap in his armor" does not allow the Exalt to bypass armor soak, nor does this Charm allow the Exalt to fire through a stone wall or beyond the maximum Range of his bow without additional magic.</description>

      <description>Essence imbues the Lawgiver's arrow with great force. This Charm supplements an Archery-based attack. If the attack hits and rolls even one die of damage, the enemy's player rolls (Stamina + Resistance) against a difficulty of (the attack's post-soak damage dice). On failure, the attack knocks the enemy away from the Exalt a number of yards equal to the Exalt's Essence. Objects do not get a roll, but are instead knocked back automatically if (the raw damage x 50) exceeds the object's weight in pounds.</description>

         <errText>If an attack enhanced by this Charm strikes its target and rolls even one die of damage, the target is automatically knocked back (archer's Essence x 3) yards without opportunity to resist. A character who has learned the Charm Lightning Strikes Twice may apply the effects of that Charm to a knockback caused by Forceful Arrow. See Ink Monkeys, Vol. 33 for the Charm Lightning Strikes Twice.</errText>

      <description>The ideal archer flows with soft and unhesitating grace through the motions of firing her weapon. This Charm is a magical flurry of two or more Archery-based attacks. Each attack costs two motes, including the first, and the Exalt can buy up to (her permanent Essence + 1) attacks. This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of the weapon's Rate, without multiple action penalties, and with a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any one attack.
   Some Archery weapons, such as firewands and siege crossbows, are difficult to fire rapidly. Characters using Trance of Unhesitating Speed with a weapon that has a Rate less than 1 must spend four motes rather than two motes on each attack.
   This Charm need not be Obvious if the character does not exceed the normal Rate of the bow, but it can be Obvious at any time if the activating character desires.

      <description>Against a single Solar, the armies of the unrighteous fall. This Charm enhances an Archery-based attack. The Solar can apply this attack (for which he rolls only once) against (his permanent Essence x 3) valid targets. He cannot apply this attack to a single person or human-sized object more than once, but he can apply it repeatedly against the same military unit or larger object. This Charm requires that the character have separate ammunition for each target. The character can use this Charm even with weapons such as firewands that would normally require a reloading action between shots.</description>

The Exalt must have an Archery weapon available for use to invoke this Charm, but it need not be in her hands. This Charm enhances the Join Battle action, giving the Solar a number of bonus successes on the Join Battle roll equal to her Essence. This Charm immediately and reflexively draws and readies an available Archery weapon.</description>

      <description>The character charges an arrow with Essence. The effects are based on the character's fighting style and anima. This Charm always adds the character's Essence in damage to an Archery-based attack. In addition, players can pick one of the following effects when purchasing this Charm.
   Fiery Arrow Attack: The Solar's arrow (or appropriate ammunition) catches fire mid-flight. If the Solar's Archery-based attack strikes a flammable material, this Charm ensures that it ignites. This Charm always destroys wooden ammunition when it's used.
   Dazzling Flare: The Solar's arrow (or other ammunition) glows with holy fire or brilliant sunlight. This Charm makes the Solar's Archery-based attack Holy, and it inflicts aggravated damage against creatures of darkness (see p. 192). The arrow shines brightly enough to be seen for (the Solar's Essence x 10) miles, if fired straight upward or otherwise unobstructed.
   Righteous Judgment Arrow: The Solar can spend a third mote on this Charm to add four extra dice of damage to the attack. This variation has a distinctive visual effect usually related to the character's anima. For example, if a Twilight's anima display shows a mandala of blue and gold light, her Righteous Judgment Arrow might have streamers of blue and gold that congeal into a mandala symbol in front of the target as the arrow hits.
   Characters can purchase additional effects for this Charm at a cost of one experience point each or one bonus point for both.

      <description>The bane of the mortal archer is her dependence on ammunition, but Lawgivers can use this Charm to shape sparkling arrows of Essence. This Charm permits a Lawgiver to make ranged attacks without using ammunition. Each such attack costs one mote of Essence. The Exalt can attack as if using any form of ammunition without Resources cost, such as a broadhead, fowling, frog crotch or target arrow. This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt's capabilities. Therefore, shaping motes into ammunition is an unrolled reflexive action and not a Charm activation.</description>

      <description>The Chosen may set aside their weapons for a time, but a life of peace can never be their fate. The Solar first draws a ranged weapon that he owns and has used to inflict damage in battle. This Charm banishes that weapon to Elsewhere. The Solar can then draw the weapon directly from Elsewhere later, using a miscellaneous action. The Charm ends when he does so. If he cancels the Essence committed to this Charm while the weapon is Elsewhere, the weapon falls to the ground at his side.
   This Charm can banish only objects (including artifacts) deliberately created as ranged weapons.

It has Rate and Accuracy equal to the Lawgiver's permanent Essence score. It inflicts lethal damage, and its damage bonus is also equal to the character's permanent Essence.

   If the character possesses an Overdrive pool, she gains one offensive mote to that pool each action while she is actively wielding her Immaculate Golden Bow. The character must be in battle to benefit from the one mote drip. She may only benefit from one drip from weaponry at a time.
   Additionally, the bow consumes mundane ammunition at half the usual rate - though the exact trick of it confounds the eyes of observers, the Solar's quiver is preternaturally wellstocked.

Doing so functions as Phantom Arrow Technique but does not cost one mote of Essence per arrow. This Charm can create firedust charges in addition to the normal ammunition options. Ammunition created by this Charm adds one die to its normal damage and never strikes an unintended target. It will stop in midair for an instant before vanishing rather than hurt someone the Solar wishes spared.</description>

      <description>Essence multiplies the force of the Lawgiver's blow. This Charm creates duplicates of the Exalt's Archery-based attack, usually meaning that one arrow or firewand charge becomes several in flight. The Solar spends three motes per duplicate attack and can create up to (her permanent Essence score) duplicate attacks. Treat the original attack and all duplicates as a single attack when making attack and defense rolls, but if they hit, calculate the damage for each attack separately. If Rain of Feathered Death is used with ammunition costing more than one dot of Resources per shot or placed in a Combo with Charms that affect the arrow's damage, the cost for this Charm increases to eight motes per duplicate. All duplicates fade after the attack</description>

      <description>A Solar's mastery of archery extends beyond bow and string and arrow, making her entire body part of the momentum of the shot and the art of the kill. This Charm permits the character to channel her shot's momentum into her own body. It may only be activated on a tick during which the Solar makes an Archery attack; at the end of the tick, the Solar flits up to (Archery x 3) yards backwards relative to the direction she fired her last shot during that tick.</description>
      <comment>On Thrust Shot Evasion: "Move and fire! This new Charm won't give you a home-grown flurry breaker, but it will help you stay away from that nasty guy with the daiklave in the first place. For those wondering why Archery only gets one new Charm - it doesn't, if you're a Dawn, thanks to the joys of Martial and Martial-ready." -H</comment>

      <description>Master archers have been known to snuff out candles with a shot from their bow. But the skill of the Lawgivers is such as to smother bonfires with a single arrow. This Charm has two uses. The one mote version enhances an Archery attack, preventing any peripheral motes spent on the attack from adding to the character's anima banner. In addition, if the attack does health levels of damage to the target, that target's anima display rises by a number of motes commensurate to the peripheral motes spent on the attack. Because the Solar is shooting out her own anima, this Charm expressly allows her to tag non-Exalted opponents with anima displays. All targets struck with Flashing Sunspot Attack suffer the same Stealth deficiencies as characters flaring their anima banners (see Exalted, p. 114).
   The second use of this Charm folds into the first use: the character may spend one mote to activate this Charm. However, instead of attacking a particular opponent, she may fire her anima into the scenery in an attempt to uncover hidden opponents. As above, any additional peripheral motes she spends on this activation are voided. Upon making this shot, her current anima display automatically drops down a level. Where her arrow lands, it creates a heatless bonfire of Solar anima 50 yards in diameter, breaking all concealment magic in the area and making stealth in the vicinity of the flare impossible. A Solar in the 8-10 range of anima display may choose instead to pay two motes to make this shot, dropping her down two full levels and creating a bonfire 100 yards in diameter. By paying a third mote, the Solar can void an 11-15 mote display, creating a bonfire 200 yards in diameter. Characters who use this Charm to drop their anima into the 1-3 range are considered to have spent only a single mote of peripheral Essence for the purposes of rebuilding their anima banner.
   At Essence 4+, the Solar may use the one mote version of this Charm to move bonfires she has created by shooting through them. The blaze is snuffed out by the arrow's passage, and reappears wherever the arrow lands. At Essence 5+, this Charm reveals the presence of dematerialized spirits and demons within the area of the bonfire. In addition, the Lawgiver may shoot out the anima of other characters, using the same mote costs to downgrade their anima as she would to void her own display. In this instance, the Lawgiver's shot need not hit the character in question; merely passing close by is enough to puff out someone's Essence candle. Her arrow snuffs her target's anima display and deposits it wherever the shot lands, creating a bonfire as if she were shooting out her own anima.
   Characters wishing to defend against having their anima snuffed may cut the arrow from its course with a successful parry, or may move their anima from its course through a successful dodge. If either their parry or their dodge fails, they do not take damage, but the arrow succeeds in stripping their anima and embedding it elsewhere in the scenery. This use of Flashing Sunspot Attack does not allow the Solar to downgrade her own anima, choosing instead to snuff out someone else's, but may allow her to exploit an opponent's flaring anima to reveal a retinue of guardian demons or a Throne Shadow assassin nearby. Bonfires created by this Charm last the entire scene before guttering out.

      <description>The Lawgiver's arrow detonates in a searing flare as it hits. If an attack enhanced by this Charm successfully strikes its target, then the target is surrounded by a one-time environmental damage effect with a radius of (Essence x 5) yards, Damage (Essence)L and Trauma (Essence). This damage is doubled against structures. If the Solar is caught within the radius of this effect, she is immune to it. At Essence 5+, if the Solar has Compassion 3+, the explosion produced by this Charm will not harm any characters she does not wish it to. At Archery 6+, the environmental field's Damage upgrades to (Essence x 2)L.
   A second purchase of this Charm, at Archery 7+, Essence 7+ permits the Lawgiver to activate Lambent Bolt of Annihilation for 10m, expanding its radius to (Essence x 50) yards. This benefit upgrades to (Essence x 100) yards at Archery 8+, Essence 8+.

Firing a personal-scale weapon which uses exotic ammunition, or ammunition with a Resources cost, demands 3m per shot fired; firing an artillery-scaled weapon with this Charm costs 3m, 1wp per shot. If the effect of Inexhaustible Bolts of Solar Fire is active, such attacks require one mote per shot, or 1m, 1wp per artillery shot.</description>

      <description>Though he flees to Heaven or to Hell, the target cannot escape the Lawgiver's arrows. Tilting her head back to feel sunlight on her face, the Solar squints and fires one shot toward her Celestial patron. That shot will strike the target as long as the target is under an open sky - be he in Malfeas, the Underworld, the Wyld, Yu-Shan or anywhere else. The archer need not know where her enemy is, but she may attack a given distant target thus only once until she sees him again. This Charm acts as a permanent range upgrade to Accuracy Without Distance whose benefits cost +9m and 1wp to activate. It explicitly can't be used at night or indoors, and won't hit indoor targets. It works in Yu-Shan only when the Unconquered Sun is ahead in the Games of Divinity and his image is projected across the sky. A second purchase, at Archery 9+, Essence 9+, permits the Charm to attack a target up to five times before the Solar sees him again. A third and final purchase, at Archery 10, Essence 10, permits the Lawgiver to use this Charm whenever she stands in sunlight, and to target her enemies so long as they are exposed to any degree of light; thus are the enemies of the greatest of the Chosen forced to dwell in absolute darkness forever. This final mode of attack may only be used once until the Lawgiver sees her target again.</description>

      <description>The Solar's heart is a storm that gathers power in the idle moments between life and death. This Charm creates an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, it fills at a rate of one offensive mote per action, to a maximum of five, when the Solar is outside the engagement range of all of his enemies. The Solar must be in battle to gain this benefit.
   Once the storm has rolled in and vented its wrath, it moves back out to sea to fill its quiver with new lightning. The Solar may renew this Charm's Overdrive benefit by moving into the engagement range of at least one opponent and remaining there for a full action. While there, he must make at least one attack against that or any other opponent rolled into combat. Doing so will reestablish the offensive mote drip as soon as the Lawgiver moves out of the engagement range of all opponents. This practice may be repeated an unlimited number of times throughout the course of battle.

      <comment>On Storm-Gathering Practice: "Recent Charms have made it less effective to fight a prepared Solar at full range. I wrote this Charm is to give the archer back some of his fire.

      <description>The athletes of the Sun often master signature attacks. This Charm uses the Solar's signature athletic move to enhance an attack. A signature move is something like leaping into the air and swinging the character's fists in a brilliant Essence-laden arc, charging an opponent like a bull or pouncing on an enemy like a tiger. If the character receives mechanical benefits such as extra movement from his Athletics action, then it must be included in his current flurry. This Charm gives one bonus success on this attack in Step 3 of attack resolution and doubles the post-soak damage of the attack in Step 7 of attack resolution. This Charm is explicitly permitted to supplement actions of other Abilities.
   The player chooses the signature attack when purchasing this Charm, but once this Charm is purchased, the character can purchase new signature attacks for one experience point or one bonus point each.

      <description>The Exalt becomes a blur of motion. This Charm increases the distance she can cover with a Move or Dash action by her Athletics score in yards. She can increase this further with Athletics Excellencies, spending motes to increase the static rating of her (Dexterity + Athletics).</description>

      <description>To the Lawgiver, the great distances between Creation's territories are not so much an obstacle as a place to keep their dominions. This Charm allows the character to travel ([her Stamina + Essence] x 10) miles per hour, for up to one hour. This is a single dramatic action. If the character invokes this Charm again as her next action, she may ignore the Willpower cost.</description>

      <description>The heroes of the dawn make the impossible look easy. This Charm allows the character to run (using the Move and Dash actions) on any surface. She cannot stop while standing on a vertical surface or while upside down, however. If she does not make a Move or Dash action on every tick, she falls. If the Solar has Essence 4 or higher, she can spend one mote per action to remain standing on a vertical or inverted surface. She can, for example, fence while standing upside down on the ceiling.</description>

      <description>The Lawgivers tread lightly when they choose. This Charm allows the Solar to run or walk on unstable surfaces (using the Move and Dash actions) as if she weighed no more than a feather. This makes surfaces such as rice paper, water, lava and writhing maggots effectively solid beneath her feet - though not necessarily harmless. To stop and stand on such a surface requires a successful reflexive difficulty 2 (Dexterity + Athletics) roll for each action in which the character wishes to maintain balance.</description>

      <description>The Solar hero focuses her Essence and repels the ground. She leaps skyward and continues to fly until the scene ends or she wills herself to land. She can fly at triple her normal Move and Dash rates, but must move at least half her normal Move on every tick or she will have to land and end this Charm. The character must remain within ([Strength + Athletics] x 3) yards of a surface. She can "climb" walls or cliffs by zooming along their surface, but she can't naturally rise more than the stated distance above the ground.
   To direct the flows of Essence, the character must keep one hand extended before her. This prevents the use of bows and other two-handed weapons while flying. The character may use thrown weapons, fight unarmed or wield one-handed weapons normally, regardless of how fast she is moving. The character can engage in aerial duels with characters capable of taking to the air, or she can hurl thrown weapons at foes on the ground or swoop down and strike them as she flies past.

      <description>This Charm suffuses the character with Solar Essence, temporarily increasing his Strength. It adds one dot to the character's Strength for each three motes spent. No combination of Charms that includes Increasing Strength Exercise can increase the character's Strength by more than his Essence, and this bonus is treated as a dice bonus from Charms.</description>

      <description>The power of her Essence speaks through the medium of her body as the Lawgiver's majesty is made manifest in her every motion. This Charm confers the following permanent benefits, none of which are considered to be dice added by a Charm:
• The character adds (Essence) to her Strength + Athletics total for the purpose of feats of strength.
• The character adds (Essence) in yards to her base movement and dash distances.
• The character adds (Essence) in yards to the distance she may jump vertically, and (Essence x 2) to the distance she may jump horizontally.

      <description>No barrier can hold against the Lawgiver's righteous strength. This is a perfect effect that supplements a feat of strength to break an object or shatter an obstruction. The object breaks; the door shatters.
   At Athletics 6+, Essence 6+ the Solar may add a point of Willpower to the Charm's cost, permitting it to also destroy magical artifacts. This renders the Charm Simple, with a Speed of (Artifact's dot rating) minutes and a DV penalty of -3. N/A artifacts are immune to this Charm, as are objects which are specifically noted as being indestructible.

      <description>A Solar need only will himself to move with speed beyond all reckoning. This Charm allows the character to cross extreme distances with a normal Move action. Upon activating this Charm the Solar may travel up to (Essence x 10) yards for three motes, (Essence x 20) yards for four motes, (Essence x 40) yards for five motes, (Essence x 60) yards for six motes, (Essence x 100) yards for seven motes, and up to one mile by paying eight motes and one Willpower. When using this Charm, the Exalt is seen to flash from location to location instantaneously. This is not teleportation - the Solar must actually cross the intervening distance. Should the Lawgiver encounter a barrier that impedes his progress prematurely, he is refunded Essence and Willpower as appropriate to the distance already traveled - for example, if an Essence 5 Solar paid seven motes to traverse a 300-yard-long canyon instantly, but discovered a wall of invisible force blocking him after only 80 yards, he would be refunded three motes. This Charm may be activated no more than once per action.</description>

      <description>A Solar who dedicates herself to the principles of speed is as omnipresent as sunlight, and just as impossible to grasp. All of the character's movement rates are doubled, as long as she is moving under her own power. More importantly, whenever the character takes a Move, Dash or Jump action, she vanishes into a blur, only to reappear at her destination. The Lawgiver is impossible to target while moving, unless the attacker succeeds on a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll against a Difficulty of (Solar's Dexterity). The Solar may be targeted normally during any tick on which she takes an action other than to Move, Dash or Jump.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Athletics 7+, Essence 7+ triples the character's movement rates and causes any Move, Dash or Jump action she takes to count as an opportunity to reestablish surprise.

      <description>Essence enhances the Solar's senses. Keen (Sense) Technique is actually three Charms, one that heightens sight, one that heightens hearing and touch and one that heightens smell and taste.
   This Charm gives two bonus successes on Awareness actions that use the relevant senses. It also allows the character to clearly perceive sensory impressions that are normally too faint for human senses to validly observe at all. Some feats appropriate for users of this Charm follow.
   Sight. The character can make out the detail on a commander's epaulet at 500 yards distance, at night. He can see the individual threads of a shirt, and with a legendary success, he can make out the motion of the mites that live on others' eyebrows.
   Hearing and Touch. The character can gauge the quality of fabric with a touch. He reduces the external penalty to target unseen characters to -1 and the internal penalty from blindness to -2. He can hear conversations normally through thick stone walls. With a legendary success, he can read by touch.
   Smell and Taste. The character can recognize others and hints of their recent activities by smell. He can track by scent, gaining one bonus success when tracking someone who has a scent. The character can identify spices and poisons by taste. With a legendary success, he can detect but not identify a few drops of tasteless poison in a wine - as its presence serves to dilute the wine.

      <description>Essence grants the character supreme sensory prowess. Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline is actually three Charms. One heightens sight, one heightens hearing and touch, and one heightens smell and taste.
   This Charm doubles the character's successes on Awareness rolls, before subtracting any external penalties. Should the character employ this Charm in combination with the appropriate Keen (Sense) Technique, it is reasonable to imagine that she could critique the mating practices of insects, read with her fingertips or gauge an individual's mood by scent.

      <description>In this degenerate time, the Lawgivers depend on a preternatural sense for danger. This Charm guarantees success on any valid Awareness roll to notice immediate mortal danger. This Charm works whether in or out of battle, awake or asleep. If the Exalt has a chance to notice a surprise attack during a prolonged struggle, a dart blown at him in the jungle, an invisible opponent or a cleverly concealed pit, he does so.
   If the Exalt's player must make such a roll and has a chance of failing it, and if the Solar can invoke this Charm, this Charm invokes itself automatically. At that time, if the player has a Combo containing this Charm, he may declare the use of that Combo instead of just the Surprise Anticipation Method Charm.
   Surprise Anticipation Method does not invoke itself if the character has already used his Charm for the action, if the character does not have any motes of Essence, if the character is Inactive and cannot become active, if the character is already certain to succeed on the Awareness roll or if the character cannot normally attempt an Awareness roll.

      <description>The Lawgivers see through all deceptions. This Charm lets the Solar see everything that is deliberately concealed within the normal range of his vision. This Charm renders Stealth effects, deception effects and concealment effects - natural and unnatural - inapplicable against the Solar. She may notice the effects, but they have no effect on her. This includes invisibility, mundane disguises, disguises augmented by Lunar shapeshifting or Sidereal astrology and Compulsion and Illusion effects that force her to deny reality. This Charm flares the Solar's anima to the 16+ mote level while in use. If another Charm contests this Charm's effects, Eye of the Unconquered Sun adds twice the Solar's Essence in automatic successes to the opposed roll to maintain the effects of this Charm. This Charm is considered a defense when used to prevent a surprise or social attack.</description>

      <description>The Solar's supernal senses expand and his mind speeds up to process a thousand myriad details in a split second. Opponents attempting to strike a Lawgiver using this Charm appear to be moving in slow motion. All of the character's attacks are enhanced as though he had just spent three ticks accumulating dice with an Aim action (as a result, the character may not normally benefit from a true Aim action while this Charm is active), and his DVs are raised by 1 against all physical attacks of which he is aware. None of these bonuses count as dice added by a Charm.
   With Essence 3+, each tick the lawgiver spends Aiming while Panoptic Fusion Discipline is active converts one die provided by this Charm into an automatic success; his opponents seem to slow even more, until their anticipated actions are outlined in golden contrails before the eyes of the Lawgiver.

      <description>Speaking a condemnation into the world, the Lawgiver's eyes blaze like twin suns, while the rest of him darkens like the onset of night. Laying a hand upon his target, the Solar curses him with the gaze of the wrathful sun. While this Charm remains in effect, sunlight itself becomes the eyes of the Solar... and the target knows it. Wherever she should go, she feels the Solar's gaze upon her in the light of the sun. As a result, the target feels constantly watched and followed - even indoors, she can feel the baleful sun dogging her every step. As a result, all Awareness rolls to detect hidden characters are made at a -3 external penalty; the character cannot sort out true feelings of being watched from the ever-present oppression of the sun. This unnatural Illusion costs one Willpower to resist for a scene, and cannot be made to permanently vanish until the Solar lifts his curse. Moreover, the feelings instilled by this Charm are not wholly false - the sun's light shows the Solar all of the target's failings. Whenever the target fails a Virtue roll or spends Willpower to suppress a Virtue while touched by the light of the sun, the Solar is granted a vision of the target's moment of self-compromise. If the target is a creature of darkness, the sun's heat stifles them even indoors or at night; the character suffers a -1 external penalty to all actions while this Charm remains in effect. If in direct sunlight, such wretches suffer a blistering heat environmental effect (see Exalted, p. 131).
   At Awareness 6+, Essence 6+ the Solar may use an enhanced version of this Charm costing six motes. Used in this fashion, all targets suffer the effects reserved for creatures of darkness, above. Additionally, if the Solar voluntarily ends this Charm by withdrawing committed Essence, creatures of darkness spontaneously combust in a blaze of sunfire, suffering a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage 10A, Trauma 5.
   With Awareness 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may issue a summons to targets afflicted with either version of this Charm, so long as they are within one mile of her. The summons is Obvious to the target's senses, as is the location where the Solar expects to meet (also within the same one-mile radius). The target has one day to reach this meeting point, and must arrive in daylight. Should she fail to do so, she will be branded with the Creature of Darkness mutation as a Shaping effect. At this level Solars may also target mortals with Falling Sun Eyes simply by speaking their name, dispensing with the Touch Keyword. This is a favored method used by the Night Caste to summon alleged criminals to face trial by the law.

      <description>The Lawgivers know those they love and those they have sworn to protect. No wicked treachery may deceive a Solar who has learned this Charm, for he sees with his heart as much as his eyes. The Solar automatically sees through any disguise, Illusion or other effect that would allow a being to falsely masquerade as a character the Lawgiver harbors a positive Intimacy for. He likewise knows any free-standing illusions or hallucinations which attempt to depict such characters for the vile falsehoods they are. This Charm does not cause the Solar to know the true identity of a character wearing such a false seeming -it only makes the attempted deception apparent to him. This Charm applies (Solar's Awareness) automatic successes to any effect-conflict roll-off.</description>

      <description>Hearing beyond hearing, the Lawgiver is supremely attuned to the tenor of his own Essence. Any utterance of his name by any individual anywhere in the same realm of existence becomes Obvious to his senses, as does the identity of the individual speaking his name. The Solar may reflexively spend 1m per long tick to hear exactly what the individual speaking his name is saying, and may continue to listen in for as long as he cares to spend Essence or has Essence to spend. He only hears the voice of individuals who have spoken his name, however; any replies that might occur are inaudible. At Awareness 7+, the Solar may hear his name when it is spoken by beings in other realms of existence.
   All manner of wards against scrying automatically cause this Charm to fail; the Seal of Eight Divinities that separates Autochthonia from Creation is considered to be such a ward so long as it remains intact.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Awareness 6+, Essence 6+ allows the Lawgiver to reflexively spend 5 Willpower to redefine the sound this Charm listens for. This must be a specific noise, rather than a general class of sounds; "the sound of the Guide to Meru I handed to Arlot landing in a trash bin" would qualify, as would "someone speaking the name of my wife, Lilith", but "anyone plot-ting against me" or "someone professing love to my wife, Lillith" would not.
   There exists a similar Linguistics Charm, called The Ever-Vigilant Scribe (mins: Linguistics 5, Essence 4; Prerequisite: Discerning Savant's Eye), which alerts the character if anyone writes his name. Rather than listening in on a conversation, the Lawgiver has the option of spending 10m to memorize the entirety of the missive in which he is mentioned, for later detailed perusal. The Ever-Vigilant Scribe's repurchase benefit allows the character to remain vigilant for the writing of other particular words or phrases.
   Abyssal Exalted, having cast their names away into Oblivion, cannot develop a Mirror to this Charm.

      <description>Only a fool would cheat the heroes of the dawn. This Charm supplements a normal or dramatic action to estimate something's quality and price. Examples include the normal action to estimate the quality of a gem and the dramatic action to evaluate a shipment of silk and spices. This Charm gives the Exalt a perfect awareness of the target object's quality and condition. This awareness gives one bonus success on any price haggling if her bargaining opponent is honest (and using Charisma) and three bonus successes if the opponent is dishonest (and using Manipulation).</description>

      <description>Smoothly managing the economy is vital to the management of a state. This Charm supplements a social or dramatic action to buy, sell or trade something wisely.
   This Charm provides information on market values. To the extent that the Exalt understands what the target item, shipment, import or export is - and to the extent that he understands the relevant markets - this Charm gives the Solar a perfect knowledge of its value in those markets. This information is sometimes worth the Charm's cost in itself, but the main effect of this Charm and this information is to reduce external penalties applying to the mercantile action by an amount equal to the Solar's Essence. Whether the Solar is trying to buy a good sword for himself, outfit his army in exceptional steel, trade off yeddim for silk before plague kills the beasts or sell off the produce of his nation's labor, he can overcome penalties from scarcity, volatile markets and trade barriers.

      <description>The Lawgivers bring order and destroy corruption. The Solar speeds the process of a bureaucracy. Normally, an organization must first take a Begin Project dramatic action - ranging from minutes to months in its duration, depending on the organization's structure - before it can start actual work on a project. The Solar communicates his desire for speedy resolution to the organization, and his player rolls ([Intelligence or Charisma] + Bureaucracy), adding the Solar's Essence in automatic successes. The difficulty of this roll is 1. If the person responsible for this project deliberately engages in delays, subtract an external penalty of ([that person's Intelligence + Bureaucracy] / 2) from the successes on the Bureaucracy roll. The Solar is aware of such delaying tactics, however.
   If the Solar succeeds, this Charm divides the time needed to begin the project by (the Solar's Essence + 1), with a maximum possible time of one season. For example, for an Essence 5 Solar, if it would normally take six months to authorize naval repairs or obtain an audience with the local king, this Charm reduces that time to a single month. If it normally takes a century to obtain necessary paperwork from a Fair Folk freehold, the Solar resolves the matter in a single season.

      <description>The Lawgivers govern wisely. This Charm supplements an organizational effort that the Solar leads - a dramatic action taken by a bureaucratic, mercantile or governmental organization. This Charm reduces the external penalties on that action by the Solar's Essence. It permanently reduces any internal penalties that organization suffers due to endemic corruption or inefficiency by one. The Solar must have sufficient authority to lead the effort. For example, the Solar could lead a nation's effort to build a network of roads, reducing the penalties imposed by bandits, uncleared wilderness and reluctant labor. This Charm incidentally purges the least useful members of the bureaucracy.</description>

      <description>The enemies of the Solar Exalted are creatures of vice. The Lawgivers exploit their venality and allow them to defeat themselves. This Charm empowers the natural indolence of others. The Solar communicates with an organization regarding a project, and his player rolls ([Intelligence or Charisma] + Bureaucracy), adding the Solar's Essence in automatic successes. The difficulty of this roll is 1. If the person responsible for this project wishes a speedy resolution, subtract an external penalty of ([that person's Intelligence + Bureaucracy] / 2) from the successes on the Bureaucracy roll. The Solar is aware of such opposition, however.
   If the Solar succeeds, this Charm multiplies the remaining time required for the target organization to begin that project by (the Solar's Essence + 1). It is always increased to at least (the Solar's Essence) in hours. If the project has already begun, this Charm instead applies an external penalty equal to the Solar's Essence to the organization's attempts to make progress.

      <description>Those who oppose the Lawgivers often break down under the burden of their own failings. This Charm supplements a deliberate attempt by the Solar to sabotage an organization's operation. Her player rolls ([Intelligence or Charisma] + Bureaucracy), adding the Solar's Essence in automatic successes. Subtract an external penalty of ([the organization's leader's Intelligence + Bureaucracy] / 2) from the successes on the Bureaucracy roll.
   If the character succeeds, then the organization suffers a permanent increase in corruption and inefficiency that imposes a -2 internal penalty on all of its actions. This Charm can be applied repeatedly to a single bureaucracy, but no combination of Charms including Foul Air of Argument Technique can impose a greater internal inefficiency and corruption penalty on an organization than (the Solar's Intelligence + Bureaucracy).

      <description>The Lawgiver subtly assumes the reins of power by creating temporary positions and laws to exploit. His player rolls (Intelligence + Bureaucracy + Essence) to perform a dramatic action designed to seize control. This dramatic action generally requires one day of effort per dot of Magnitude of the bureaucracy the character attempts to gain support within, though stunts may reduce this period at the Storyteller's discretion. This roll must overcome the Dodge MDV of the leader of the targeted organization for the Charm to take effect. If successful, the character will have five dots of Backing in a particular bureaucracy, though her official status remains unchanged. The leader of the targeted bureaucratic organization may choose to block a successful activation by spending 5 Loyalty. Doing so immunizes the organization against this Charm for one season.</description>

      <description>That which the Solars have brought into the world, they may take away with a word. The shinma shiver as the Solar utters a condemnation into the cosmos, consigning to destruction a bureaucratic organization he has created. The Lawgiver's player rolls (Willpower + Bureaucracy) against a difficulty of the (Wits + Bureaucracy + Essence / 2) of the head of the targeted organization. Should this roll succeed, the targeted organization will collapse into utter ruin over the course of the next season: its employees resign, papers catch fire, office buildings are flooded or collapse into sinkholes. The Solar immediately gains a number of motes equal to twice the Magnitude of individuals employed by the targeted organization.
   Alternate functions of this Charm exist, if the Solar has a rating of 6+ in the appropriate Ability:
   With Craft 6+ the Solar may irreparably compromise artifacts and manses he has created, causing the magic to leak out of them. A daiklave simply becomes an inert hunk of orichalcum, while a manse will no longer channel Essence -it is simply a building sitting in a demesne. Roll (Willpower + Craft) against a difficulty of the owner's (Wits + Craft + Essence / 2). Success restores (rating x 2) motes.With Occult 6+, the Solar may rend asunder spells he has cast, restoring (Spell's Circle x 3) motes.
   With Lore 6+, the Solar may dissolve a landscape he created with a single invocation of Wyld-Shaping Technique back into the chaos from which it arose, restoring five motes.With Integrity 6+, the Solar may destroy one of his own Intimacies, so long as he has held it for at least one season, restoring five motes.
   This Charm may be activated no more than once per scene.

      <description>Upon learning this Charm, the Solar impresses his identity upon the very fabric of the cosmos. The shinma open eyes they do not possess and behold the Exalt's face. They know him then, and will accept no substitutes.
   Henceforth, all attempts to impersonate the Lawgiver suffer a -2 external penalty, and any character doing so suffers a three mote surcharge on the cost of all Charms while masquerading as the Solar. The motes spent to satisfy this surcharge are tithed to the Solar, delivered when he next awakens from at least one hour of uninterrupted sleep. The Solar may voluntarily exempt specific individuals from this cost and penalty, if he desires, and may just as easily revoke such exemptions. Additionally, whenever another individuals wears his face (either by magic or mundane disguise) that fact becomes Obvious to the Lawgiver when he next awakens - though the location, identity, and goal of the imposter are not revealed.
   Finally, no effect may draw motes out of the Solar's Essence pool without his consent, and no form of magical mental influence may force him to give such consent.

      <description>The Solar pours her very soul into the works she has brought forth in Creation. Upon learning this Charm, the character selects a bureaucratic organization she presently leads. Should the Solar come to no longer lead that organization (whether due to resignation, coup, or the organization's dissolution), she may spend one Willpower to target a different organization she leads; or she may spend five Willpower at any time to transfer this Charm's focus to a different organization.
   This Charm takes effect when the Solar meets his final day. Upon death, rather than guarding the Lawgiver's corpse, his po soul becomes the quiet guardian of the targeted organiza-tion, bending its strength toward guiding the new leadership of the organization. In essence, the po does everything in its power to ensure the organization continues to run as though the Solar were still alive, sometimes prompting rumors that a Lawgiver has not truly died at all, but is simply guiding the organization in secret.
   A po spirit empowered by this Charm possesses the Solar's Attributes, Abilities, Essence rating, and, in addition to an array of dangerous arcanoi, the following unique powers:
• All General Charms the Solar knew in life, though they may only be used to support, lead, or defend the orga-nization the spirit is attached to.
• The ability to manifest itself in a form indistinguishable from the living Solar.
• The po cannot be permanently destroyed short of Ghost-Eating Technique or equivalent magic, reforming at sunset each evening so long as the idea remains in the heart's of the organization's members that the Solar or his vision lives on, and so long as the organization it was set to guide endures.
   Furthermore, when the Solar's Exaltation next incarnates, this spirit will seek out the new hero and seek to teach her everything it knows about the organization and how to carry on the last incarnation's work, effectively and smoothly returning the fallen Solar to his rightful place at the head of the order. In addition to imparting detailed knowledge about the organization in question, this consists of a Training effect allowing the po to impart dots of Bureaucracy at a rate of one per week, up to a limit of the former incarnation's Bureaucracy rating. This may explicitly break the newly incarnated Solar's normal age cap - for example, a Solar who had only been Exalted for a year could be trained up to Bureaucracy 7 (the rating of her former incarnation), as a Training effect.
   A similar Charm exists for the War Ability which targets a military organization and permits training in the War Ability.

      <description>The world knows those whom the Lawgivers claim as their own. The Solar touches a character who has just expressed a pledge of loyalty to him. In a flash of light, a golden brand depicting the Solar's anima icon painlessly appears at the point of contact and then disappears. Most First Age Solars chose to mark their underlings' brows.
   This mark is permanent, reappearing whenever the target performs an action at the direct behest of his Solar lord and declares that his labors are performed on behalf of a Prince of Creation. The Solar may withdraw the brand as a miscellaneous action at any time, inflicting one automatic level of lethal damage.
   A second purchase of this Charm, at Bureaucracy 5+, Essence 4+, allows the Solar to activate this Charm to cause a servant's brand to flare to visibility if the servant is within the same realm of existence as the Lawgiver. As long as the Solar takes no other action, he may observe and hear what transpires around his servant, with the brand as his fixed point of perspective. A third purchase, at Essence 5+, permits the Solar to use any of his Bureaucracy Charms through or on behalf of a remotely observed servant. These Charms base their effects and limitations on the Lawgiver's traits rather than the servant's.

      <description>Essence flows through bureaucracies and hierarchies just as it does through the geomancy of Creation or the anatomy of a living body. As a geomancer might change the landscape to create a demesne, or an acupuncturist use needles to correct a patient's essence meridians, so too can the Solar shape the essence of a business with holidays and rewards.
   Servant-Rewarding Benevolence is a dramatic action to provide benefit to the members of a social and/or mass combat unit. If the Solar is not the unit's leader, the unit's rank-and-file must officially recognize the Lawgiver's authority to provide the benefits in question. The action can be anything that would logically make unit members happier. Examples include offering one-time bonus pay, offering a state holiday off work or taking a legion out for a wild night on the town.
   For a month following the enchanted special occasion, the Charm provides the following benefits:
• All members add +1 bonus success on any non-combat action they take to advance the group's Policy. Heroic members add +2 successes instead.
• Mass social units add +2 to their MDVs against any effect that targets the group through one of its members instead of its leader.
• The unit adds +1 Morale in mass combat.
• Whenever the unit's leader channels Valor to enhance a unit action during mass combat, he adds +2 bonus successes in addition to the usual dice.

      <description>The secrets of mending include the secrets of breaking. This Charm is a dramatic action taken to disassemble an object or structure. The character chooses whether to harmlessly or destructively take the object apart. This Charm allows the disassembly of only those objects the character can break with a feat of strength, adding twice the character's Craft to the character's (Strength + Athletics) pool to determine valid feats. This Charm can disassemble a single object in (8 - Essence) minutes, with a minimum of three minutes.
   This Charm can target larger structures, such as castles and villages. In such cases, the Exalt proceeds methodically from one major component to the next, taking them apart at the normal rate, until he is interrupted or the task is complete. To take apart a large structure, the Exalt must dedicate at least (8 - Essence) hours, with a minimum of three hours, to the task; he cannot stop early unless he finishes or unexpected events interrupt him. The Exalt cannot demolish anything larger than a large castle or village with a single invocation of this Charm.

      <description>The Chosen bring harmony to Creation. This Charm supplements a Craft action. It removes the need for tools as well as penalties for crafting without tools. The character still needs raw materials. This Charm can enhance a Craft action to build something, in which case the character accomplishes (Essence x 3) hours of work for each hour invested.</description>

      <description>The Solar touches a structure or object and gains a perfect understanding of what can damage or destroy it, and how well. Furthermore, for this Charm's duration, her attacks ignore the target's soak and deal to it (Essence x 5) additional dice of damage. If the object is completely indestructible, the Charm's duration becomes Instant, and Lawgiver is instead granted divine inspiration, discovering an existing Flaw of Invulnerability (created by the Storyteller) that would permit the object's destruction.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted see potential in the matter and Essence of Creation far beyond the petty limitations of Primordial vision - and make that potential reality. A character who knows this Charm may design artifacts and manses more efficiently.
   The character may cap a demesne with a manse rated one dot higher than the demesne. For example, the Lawgiver could cap a 3-dot demesne with a 4-dot manse; the difficulty of all design rolls and the required construction time would be that of a 3-dot manse, but the resultant structure would be a 4-dot manse in all regards (producing a 4-dot hearthstone, having creation points equivalent to a 4-dot manse [see The Books of Sorcery, vol. III - Oadenol's Codex], and so forth). The Solar may still deliberately weaken his designs to produce one-dot manses, if desired. If used to design a 5-dot manse, De-sign Beyond Limit does not raise it to N/A level, instead providing ten additional creation points with which to design its features, and it making the manse a potential geomantic channel to sustain a N/A level.
   Genius and excellence springs from the Solar's hands almost unbidden when crafting artifacts. He needs only accumulate a number of successes equal to an artifact rated one dot lower than her actual project (see Exalted, p. 134). For example, if attempting to forge a grand daiklave, the Solar would need only 30 successes rather than the usual 60. This Charm provides no benefit when the Solar deigns to construct one-dot artifacts.

      <description>The Solar craftsman has progressed beyond applying discrete bits of knowledge and skill - every part of him is an extension of his prowess, and intuitive understanding blossoms from every aspect of the world around him. The Solar perfectly understands how to recreate any object he makes use of. When he climbs into a warstrider, he is able to estimate what prayers accompanied its creation, the temperatures used to forge its armor, and the order in which its parts were assembled. When he fires a bow, he deduces the materials and methods used to create it - and to fletch the arrow it just fired. When he eats a cake, he deduces all the particulars of its recipe.
   Any effort the Solar undertakes to precisely reproduce an object analyzed by this Charm reduces its cumulative difficulty by half and the total number of successes required by his (Essence x 2), to a minimum of 5. With Craft 6+, Essence 6+ the Solar also counts each hour of work invested in building such a replica as three hours of labor.
   This Charm cannot perfectly analyze N/A-rated wonders like the Five-Metal Shrike or unique miracles of Primordial (or stranger) design such as the Sword of Creation, the elemental poles, or the Well of Udr. Instead, it grants the Solar a sense of vague but potent inspiration - a clue as to where useful information about or elements of the wonder's construction might be sought. On all occasions when the Solar Exalted have attempted to use Holistic Miracle Understanding to examine an Exaltation, they have experienced only an encouraging-but-vague sense that the answer rests within themselves.

      <description>The Lawgiver leaves the world eternal monuments to her genius. Anything she uses Craft to create will not age, erode, wear out or otherwise diminish through the natural processes of time and use. Nor will it require maintenance. It can, however, be deliberately destroyed. Applying this Charm's benefit raises an item's effective Resources value by one. Applying it to an artifact raises the artifact's effective background rating by one dot. The benefit granted by this Charm is optional; the Solar may still produce lesser works, if she wishes.</description>

      <description>A Lawgiver who has focused his expertise upon a certain expression of craftsmanship soon finds that his least effort matches and exceeds the most desperate labors of mortal artisans. This Charm may be purchased multiple times, once for each basic Craft Ability the Solar possesses at a rating of 4 or higher. Purchasing this Charm adds (Essence/2) automatic successes to all rolls made with the Ability in question. An Essence 5 Solar with Peerless Paragon of Fire would add three successes to all Craft (Fire) rolls at no cost.
   Exotic Crafts such as Craft (Fate) or Craft (Glamour) require Essence 3+, while First Age Craft skills such as Craft (Genesis) and Craft (Magitech) require Essence 4+.

With this Charm active, as the character works he names whatever small things he needs - advanced tools, alchemical substances, common materials - and they appear in his hands, ready for use. Motes spent on this Charm remain committed as long as it takes to resolve a single roll. For artifact creation, this generally means one season, the length of a single roll interval.

      <description>As the premiere artisans of the Chosen, the Solars can achieve in a mortal lifetime what lesser Exalted require centuries to understand. Purchase of this Charm reduces by one dot each the minimum Craft, Lore, Medicine and Occult requirements to build or repair artifacts - to a minimum requirement of one dot for any Ability normally required for the task. Therefore, a four-dot artifact (normally requiring Lore, Occult and Craft at 6 to build and at 5 to repair) would require those Abilities only at 5 to build or 4 to repair. Purchasing this Charm also reduces by three the total number of dots the character must allocate among Craft, Lore and Occult to design manses. Characters may purchase this Charm up to two times.</description>

Her Dodge DV is still 0 against an undodgeable attack, but she takes no further penalties.</description>

      <description>The Solar is as elusive as a dream. The Exalt invokes this Charm after using her Dodge DV to defend against an attack. This Charm allows her to leap away from her opponent, jumping up to ([Strength + Dodge] x 3) yards vertically or twice this distance horizontally. The Exalt chooses the exact direction and distance of this leap, so long as it is away from her attacker. This Charm is treated as a counterattack, even though the jump is not hostile. It reduces the character's DV by one, it cannot be used with a counterattack, and it is resolved in Step 9 of attack resolution.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted understand the humble wisdom of the reed and the willow. The greater the force directed against them, the more nimble they become to avoid harm. Whenever the Lawgiver uses his Dodge DV to avoid a physical attack, he adds a bonus equal to half the attacker's Essence, rounded up. This bonus counts as dice added by a Charm.</description>

      <description>The body and soul of the Solar Exalted are as one, transcending all limits in emulation of the light from which they were born. A Lawgiver who has purchased this Charm has perfected his body at the motonic level through a mastery of Dodge techniques, allowing him to accrue ambient motes as a matter of course. Whenever the Solar successfully avoids an attack by applying his Dodge DV, he gains (attacker's Essence / 2, round up) motes in step 10. This Charm is subject to the following limitations:
• The attack must be made with intent to injure the Lawgiver, and must also be capable of harming him. For example, this Charm would offer no benefit if the character were attacked with a firewand while carrying a hearthstone which rendered him immune to fire.
• The Charm offers no benefit if the Solar defends himself with a Charm carrying a Flaw of Invulnerability.
• Lightspeed Body Dynamics is incompatible with any other Charm which grants the character motes of Essence.

      <description>Streams of golden anima trace the Solar's movement in shimmering after-images, as light itself pays homage to the perfection of the Sun's Chosen. Whenever the Solar applies his Dodge DV against an attack, he can use this Charm to penalize the attacker's roll as though they were blind (see Exalted, p. 152). His enemies are unable to target him clearly through the blinding light and refracted images of his anima.
   With Essence 3+, the Solar can extend the duration of this Charm to one tick for a surcharge of three motes.

      <description>Bearing knives like lupine fangs, the Iron Wolves know that the best defense is a good offense. A character invokes this Charm after using her Dodge DV to defend against an attack. The Exalt flashes out of existence, dodging toward her opponent in an effort to gain the advantage of surprise. The character moves up to (10 + [Strength x Dodge] x 3) yards toward her opponent in a blur of untraceable speed, reappearing immediately on the next tick, rendering her an invalid target for this Charm's duration. This Charm's effects take place in step 10 after resolving the attack that provoked it. The character may use this Charm to pass through solid structures, but she may not use it against an opponent who is inside her engagement range, nor may she enhance the distance this Charm will carry her through the use of hearthstones, artifacts, sorcery, or other Charms. This Charm may not be used to move away from an opponent.
   If the Lawgiver must close the gap now, she may pay five motes, one Willpower to flash forward up to 300 yards. If her opponent is inside this range, he finds the Lawgiver suddenly at his neck, making a counterattack with the Ability of her choice, turning this Charm's duration to Instant. If her target is not in range, the Lawgiver may not activate this version of Night's Avenger Lunge.
   At Essence 5+, the character may use Night's Avenger Lunge to counter attacks made against her from up to 100 miles away by paying ten motes, one Willpower. This also provides a counterattack and turns the duration of this Charm to Instant.

      <description>This Charm enhances its prerequisite. The Lawgiver may opt to pay a +3m surcharge when activating Seven Shadow Evasion, extending its duration to one tick rather than separately activating the Charm against each individual attack.
   Solars with Essence 5+ may extend the duration of perfect dodging to one action by paying a +3m, 1wp surcharge. Only when the character's DV refreshes does the maelstrom of flickering shadows resolve back into the familiar form of the Lawgiver.

He may apply a Dodge DV-based Defend Other action to all willing individuals within (Essence x 3) yards. At Essence 5+, this Charm's zone of protection may be extended to (Essence x 10) yards.
   A second purchase of this Charm, at Dodge 6+, Essence 6+, adds an additional feature to Aegis of Altruistic Imposition: if the Lawgiver is struck by an attack intended for another while using this Charm, he may pay four motes and one point of Willpower in Step 9 to perfectly redirect that attack to a different character within the radius of the Charm. The attack does no harm to the Lawgiver, and instead applies its original roll and effects to its new target as a Counterattack.

      <description>When the Primordials once uprooted mountains and cast them down against the armies of the gods. The Solar Exalted, embarrassed by such clumsy efforts, learned to absent themselves from the paths of these excessive demonstrations. A character who has learned this Charm may pay a four mote surcharge when invoking Seven Shadow Evasion to avoid an attack which inflicts damage on everything within an area (such as Lambent Bolt of Annihilation). The Solar's dodge deposits her at the nearest safe edge of the damage effect, if that location is within (Essence x 50) yards; walls and other obstacles are no impediment to this evasion. She may also carry out any consenting characters she is protecting with Defend Other actions at the time of activation. At Dodge 6+, Essence 6+ this restriction disappears, and the Solar's leaping dodges will carry her as far as necessary to remove her from the effect.</description>

      <description>Flow Like BloodThe Lawgiver matches his motions to that of an opponent's weapon, making sure that the targeted blade can strike him no more than it can cut its own shadow. This Charm acts as a permanent enhancement to Seven Shadow Evasion, allowing it to be invoked with a two-mote surcharge. This extends its duration to "One action", but allows it only to be applied to a single weapon carried by a single opponent (natural weapons such as a Lunar Exalt's claws or a martial artist's kicks are valid targets for this purpose). The Charm may not be reinvoked with this enhanced benefit to change targets to a different weapon before its duration elapses, nor may the duration be canceled early by releasing Essence commitment. Seven Shadow Evasion may still simultaneously be invoked at its normal cost to deal with other attacks.</description>

      <description>The Sun's Chosen define their own reality. This Charm protects the character from any Shaping effect that directly alters her mind, body, spirit or traits. This includes instantaneous Shaping effects and any new alterations caused by long-term Shaping effects. This Charm also protects the character from any undodgeable, unblockable Shaping attacks. Wyld energy cannot create a serpent inside the character's stomach or turn her armor to lava, whether it's manipulated by an enemy or its own random whims, because these effects inflict immediate damage and the character's DV is not applicable.
   This Charm does not protect against the miscellaneous dangers of the Wyld. If a Wyld effect creates a hundred-headed snake monster with burning chalcedony eyes that then eats the character, this is not directly altering the character's body through shaping. Nor is it an "attack" when a Wyld effect transforms the character's armor into harmless gossamer spider webs - simply an undesirable effect.

Characters using Shaping effects that involve the character can remove this penalty with any stunt that reconciles the Shaping effect with the Lawgiver's sense of her own destiny. In the Wyld or the Labyrinth, this Charm reduces the frequency of random unfortunate incidents by a factor of 10. There is no cost to use this Charm - it is a permanent enhancement to the Exalt's nature.</description>

      <description>To the Solar Exalted, "death" and "surrender" are almost the same thing. This Charm helps a character hold fast to her fundamental Intimacies in the face of temptation. The player picks one of the character's Intimacies when purchasing this Charm. For the purposes of this Solar Charm, this loyalty must be to an ideal - not to a person or a love, but sometimes to a relationship; not to a tribe or city, but sometimes to the nation she might build of them; not to a battle or a war, but to the extinction of one foe or the conquest of a great region. (Other Exalted have versions of this Charm that support different commitments).
   This Charm allows the character to treat mental influence to betray or forsake that Intimacy as an unacceptable order (see p. 180). If the character voluntarily abandons that Intimacy or it becomes obsolete, this Charm ceases to function until, first, a new story begins and, second, the character chooses a new Intimacy to which the Charm applies.
   Players can also shift this Charm to a new Intimacy at any time by spending one experience point. Players can purchase this Charm a second time to reinforce one additional Intimacy. Any further loyalties require more specialized magic.

      <description>In foul nests of demons whose ways of corruption assault the human mind; amidst the courts of faeries gluttonous for human souls; in Nexus, surrounded by a thousand temptations - though the whole world seeks to drag him down, the Lawgiver is unmoved. This Charm increases the character's Dodge MDV by his Temperance for the remainder of the scene. Storytellers can allow the Exalt to use his Conviction, Compassion or Valor score instead of Temperance if the character has appropriate motivation.</description>

      <description>Like a dream slipping from a waking man's grasp, the Solar eludes others' attempts to chain his mind. The Solar uses this Charm in response to an attempt at mental influence, be it natural or unnatural. In addition to its core effects, this Charm perfectly negates that attempt at influence.
   This Charm defends the character against mental influence by forging an instant, sorcerously charged Intimacy (see boxed text) to an idea or ideal that protects him. For the purposes of this Charm, this Intimacy might be enmity with the person attempting influence, contempt for that person or loyalty to something that the influence would make him betray. This effect is optional if the character already has such an Intimacy. If he has a preexisting one that is applicable, the magic can bolster it to inviolability instead. Characters observing the Solar when this Charm is used can make a reflexive (Perception + Investigation) roll against a difficulty of the character's Temperance to notice the newborn or newly renewed enmity, loyalty or disdain. The Solar genuinely accepts the Intimacy to which he commits himself with this Charm, although the player decides how much weight he gives it compared to his other ideas, plans, loyalties and goals. At the end of the story, the Essence charge dissipates from the Intimacy, and it is no longer a perfect defense, though the character may maintain it for later use, the sake of the memory or out of genuine feeling.

      <description>Others look to the Lawgivers for strength against temptation. This Charm allows characters loyal to the Solar to replace their own Essence with the Solar's Integrity score when calculating mental defense. It subtracts two dice (as a -2 internal penalty) from the dice pools of characters loyal to the Solar when they are actively attempting to betray that loyalty. This Charm has no effect on Abyssal Exalted or other Solar Exalted.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted draw on their unwavering desire and intention to survive sustained mental assault. This Charm allows the Exalt to refuse unnatural mind control effects (see p. 180) and Virtue compulsions (see p. 115) at a reduced Willpower cost. This Charm reduces the Willpower cost by one point for each five motes spent. If the Exalt pays the entire cost in Essence, she does not accumulate Limit. For example, if rejecting a supernaturally persuasive offer would normally require two Willpower, the Exalt can spend two Willpower; five motes, one Willpower; or 10 motes. If the character would normally break free of the mental influence after spending a certain amount of Willpower, treat the character as having paid the full Willpower price even if it is paid in motes.</description>

      <description>The Solar dedicates himself to a new goal or ideal. If the Solar has not already established an Intimacy to this ideal, this Charm allows him to do so instantly. This Charm lets the Solar treat this Intimacy as an additional Motivation, with all the benefits and drawbacks thereof. Lawgivers can invoke this Charm repeatedly but they can benefit from only a number of additional Motivations equal to their Conviction.</description>

      <description>Reality itself bows to the prowess of the Solar Exalted when they act in accordance with the power infusing their Exaltation. All of the Solar's stunts are upgraded by one category (to a maximum of being three-point stunts) when the Lawgiver's actions reinforce her role as a god-king. Specifically, the Solar's actions must involve: ruling over or protecting those less powerful than herself; administrating territory or resources she owns; educating others; spreading either the worship of the Unconquered Sun or herself; or combating creatures of darkness. Successful stunts that are upgraded from two to three points by this Charm are not elligible to draw a point of experience as a reward. Natural three point stunts, rather than being upgraded, add automatic successes rather than dice. If a stunt has already been upgraded due to resonance with the Solar's Motivation, Lion's Roar Recovery provides no benefit.</description>

      <description>Those who would tempt the noble Lawgivers from their righteous path pay a price in fire. This Charm is a counterattack that may be used in response to any unnatural mental influence directed at the Solar. The Solar's caste mark blazes white and red for a moment; then, wherever the attacker may be, she is engulfed in a bonfire of pure white flames. This is treated as an automatically successful Shaping counterattack which inflicts (Essence) dice of lethal damage (aggravated against creatures of darkness). Should any astrology be used to attempt to divine the target's fate during the scene in which Sacrosanct Soul Retribution is directed at him, such inquiries automatically succeed, but return only the following puzzling message: THE ANATHEMA IS HERE.
   This Charm may be used regardless of the range from which unnatural mental influence is deployed, but may only be used once in response to a particular static source of mental influence. For example, the Solar could only deploy this Charm in response to a book enhanced with Linguistics Charms once, no matter how many times he read the book.
   At Integrity 6+, Essence 6+, the Solar may also pay one point of Willpower to bestow the creature of darkness mutation on targets of this Charm, as a Shaping effect. Additionally, at this level, anyone slain by Sacrosanct Soul Retribution's white fire is twisted and castigated into a new form, reborn as a terrible monster possessing the same non-magical traits they previously enjoyed, with (Solar's Essence x 3) points of mutations added. If the beast was not a creature of darkness before, it is now. This beast is cleansed most of its previous memories, all Intimacies, and any Essence-based powers it may have possessed. It is reborn with a new, unalterable Motivation: To loyally serve the Lawgiver who created it. Thus do those who would dare tamper with the minds of the Sun's champions pay for their temerity.

      <description>In eternal night, the Solar Exalted are evidence of a perfect light that once was and shall be again. Should the sun go down forever, the Lawgivers stand as proof of an imperishable hope, surpassing the light from whence they sprang. By learning this Charm, the Solar substantiates for himself the foundational principles of Holy by which the universe abides and the Unconquered Sun decides. In the event of the death of the Unconquered Sun, the Solar's Holy Charms retain their full capacity against all creatures of darkness. This Charm also permanently lowers the cost to activate all Charms with the Holy Keyword by one mote, to a minimum of zero motes.</description>

      <description>Embracing the judgment of the Unconquered Sun and searing that wisdom into her heart, the Solar becomes an avatar of her caste. The effects of this Charm vary depending on the character's caste. This Charm cannot be learned by non-Solar Exalted under any circumstances.
• Dawn: When employing her anima power, the Exalt gains +2 to her DV against all opponents, regardless of Valor. Even automatons and the walking dead find the blazing radiance of the Lawgiver impossible to behold directly. Additionally, the awful gravity of the Unconquered Sun's wrath lends surety and power to the character's blows, raising the Accuracy of all weapons (including natural weapons) the Solar wields by one and their Damage by two.
• Zenith: When employing her anima power, the Exalt doubles the normal soak benefit against creatures of darkness and may reflexively burn every inanimate corpse within 30 yards for a single mote. While her anima flares at the (11+)-mote level, she may also burn corpses for a cost of 0m with a touch, and the minimum damage of attacks directed at creatures of darkness is raised by one die.
• Twilight: When her anima flares at the (11+)-mote level, the Exalt reduces the cost of all sorcery by half, to a minimum of one mote. This reduction does not apply to necromancy.
• Night: The cost of the stealth field aspect of the Exalt's anima power is reduced from 10 motes to five motes, and the difficulty of rolls to track or notice the character rises by (Essence) rather than (Essence/2).
• Eclipse: The Exalt takes the laws of Heaven into her own hands. Whenever someone breaks   38 an oath she has sanctified, the Eclipse is immediately aware of both the transgression and transgressor. Indeed, if she so desires, the Solar may even specify the circumstances in which the oath-breaker's botches will manifest (though subject to Storyteller approval). The Exalt may not actually forgive the oath-breaker of any punishment, and Heaven will vent its wrath in the usual manner if the Storyteller judges that the specified circumstances are implausible enough that the transgressor is unlikely to ever actually suffer punishment. As a final, as-yet-unrealized benefit, the Eclipse anima power as enhanced by this Charm may find purchase upon the very Yozis themselves. When deferred with the Fiend anima power, the Ebon Dragon suffers punishment in the oathbreaker's stead thanks to an obscure and overlooked clause in his surrender oath.

      <description>The virtue of the Lawgivers is like the sun at noon. Clouds might obscure it, but its light can never truly be banished or denied. This Charm may be subconsciously activated whenever the character suffers under a source of unnatural mental influence that alters his behavior, even if another effect would otherwise bar the Solar from invoking it. The effects of the unnatural mental influence become Obvious to all observers, making it clear that the Solar labors under some manner of curse or trickery rather than his own desires. Immaculate doctrine already accounts for this with tales of Anathema as wicked spirits possessing the unlucky.
   The Charm also makes it Obvious that the Solar is not himself (though it does not make the sourceof his odd behavior Obvious) when in Limit Break, but only to those who harbor a positive Intimacy toward the character. The Neverborn tremble in their tombs when their curse is laid bare before the world thus.
   This Charm's effect upon observers cannot be resisted, as it is not a form of mental influence. It is simply the truth.

      <description>Internalizing her dedication to the principles of her own legend, the Lawgiver shines with the very radiance of her patron, bringing the light of the sun to Creation in fact as well as metaphor. The Solar's anima banner counts as real, natural sunlight for all purposes. This light shines brightly enough to affect beings out to a radius of (Essence) yards at the eight- to 10-mote level of display, and out to a radius of 30 yards at the (11+)-mote level of display.</description>

      <description>Although the power of even the youngest of Lawgivers is sufficient to rock the pillars of Heaven and slay the makers of the world, some Chosen find themselves unsatisfied with any limitations upon their power. Reaching beyond, they grasp for greater might at any cost.
   As a permanent upgrade to his competence, the Solar gains the ability to spend experience normally to buy his Essence rating up to a dot higher than his age would otherwise allow (see Exalted, p. 275). This is treated as his real, natural rating for the purpose of buying Attribute and Ability dots, Charms and other such traits. Yet, he may enjoy the benefits of this higher Essence rating only while Glory to the Most High is active. When the Charm is not active, he is treated as though his Essence rating is whatever it would be if he did not possess Glory to the Most High, and as though he did not possess any Charms or dots that this lower Essence rating would not permit him to obtain.
   The Solar's anima immediately flares to its full iconic splendor when Glory to the Most High is activated, and recedes at its normal rate. The character also gains 10 motes of Essence (three in the Personal Essence pool, seven in the Peripheral Essence pool) filling out the sudden difference in his Essence pool's capacity.
   When this Charm ends, the character must roll the higher of (Essence) or his primary Virtue, and add a number of points of Limit equal to his successes. This Charm may never be learned or used by non-Solar Exalted under any circumstances.

      <description>When a Lawgiver's vast strength at last reaches its limit and he falls in defense of Creation, the world itself may cry out for its savior to rise up and fight on.
   This Charm automatically takes effect when the character's Incapacitated health box is marked off with lethal or aggravated damage, provided the Solar fell while attempting to defend or champion those weaker than himself, at the Storyteller's discretion. (As a general guideline, any situation where the Solar could reasonably have channeled his Compassion likely qualifies). Subtle ribbons of golden Essence wind across the battlefield, trailing back to the masses on whose behalf the Lawgiver fought. If they believe in him, then he hears their prayers as his life bleeds away; if they spurn him despite his efforts, their deep need for a savior calls out to him regardless. One long tick after becoming Incapacitated, the Solar rises from the ground in a flare of sizzling Essence, iconic anima burning around him. Half of his health levels immediately restore themselves, along with half his total Essence and Willpower (assuming he fell with those pools reduced below the halfway point). At the end of the scene, his permanent Essence rating falls by one dot. This Charm may not be triggered more than once per season. Non-Solar Exalted may never learn this Charm.

      <description>For a Solar, defeat is only a marker in the chapters of existence, rather than the end of the book. Upon learning this Charm, the Exalt gains an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, he may fill it when confronting an opponent who has defeated the Solar in his present incarnation or any of his past lives. Defeat in this context means physical combat; defeating the Solar in social combat does not qualify, nor does beating him at Gateway or other contests. This Charm does not grant the Exalt special knowledge of defeats that occurred in past lives - the Solar must come by this information by any valid means of doing so.
   The Lawgiver gains (Essence + 2) offensive motes upon activation, and one additional mote each time his DV refreshes for the rest of the scene. The Solar may only activate this Charm once per scene, and only in battle against one who has defeated him. If the fight concludes with the Exalt's victory, he has avenged himself, and can no longer activate this Charm against his vanquished opponent. Otherwise, the Solar may continue to assume Righteous Avenger's Aspect until he has avenged himself.
   An inconclusive battle is not sufficient to release a character from the Solar's vengeance. If an earthquake splits the street between the Solar and his enemy, razing the city and carrying the two halves so far apart continued battle becomes impossible, the Solar does not lose his ability to activate this Charm against that opponent. Nor does fleeing the Solar release the target from his vengeance.
   At Essence 3+, the Solar may activate this Charm on behalf of a person or group of people he has a positive Intimacy toward. In this case, the Solar needs only evidence of physical harm to activate this Charm. Seeing a man strike his wife would be sufficient to channel the Lawgiver's wrath into Overdrive, as would watching his personally-trained horsemen scathed by a hail of arrows from a deathknight's bow.
   This Charm requires that the Solar is aware he faces an opponent who has defeated him or wronged the subject of one of his positive Intimacies. The Solar's opponent must actually have done so - the Charm will not function if the Lawgiver is mistaken, or if he is not aware of what his opponent has done. The Solar may always activate this Charm on behalf of his Lunar mate, even at Essence 2.

      <comment>On Righteous Avenger's Aspect: "Incidentally, for those of you who are really into playing the Night or Twilight detective, there will eventually be an Investigation Charm that lets you take the victims of crimes you have investigated as temporary positive Intimacies until you have solved the crime or otherwise secured some kind of justice." -Ø</comment>

      <description>The greatness of the Lawgivers is such that even the natural orders of Heaven and Hell must pause to bow before their magnificence. This Charm enhances its prerequisite so that any spirit who would qualify for the benefit of Sun King Radiance becomes immune to the magically compelling commands of its superiors (see Exalted, p. 295), though standard forms of mental influence, Charm-backed or otherwise, still apply. Additionally, loyal demons become immune to Yozi possession. Should such spirits act to betray the Lawgiver, the penalty inflicted by Sun King Radiance upon their actions becomes external rather than internal.</description>

      <description>The Lawgivers see into others' hearts. This Charm allows the character to make an Investigation-based roll to profile someone's personality. The character need not interact with the target, but must have sufficient material evidence of the target's personality to estimate the target's nature. If the target deliberately sends out misleading cues, subtract an external penalty of ([the target's Manipulation + Socialize] / 2) from the successes on the Investigation roll. Corrupted or incomplete evidence can also impose an external penalty.
   If the roll succeeds, then each success reduces external penalties on dramatic, social and mass combat actions the character takes against the target. This Charm cannot reduce external penalties by an amount greater than the Solar's Essence.
   The Exalt can have only one profile of a given target. The crispness of the profile - that quality that reduces external penalties - lasts only as long as the committed Essence. The Lawgiver's player cannot roll again to build a new profile unless the story ends or a new piece of evidence allows a dramatic reconceptualization of the target's personality.

The character can also recognize the deliberate use of half-truths, though doing so does not tell her which part of the statement is true.

      <description>This Charm forces the truth from those who would lie to the heroes of the dawn. It involves an interrogation, and the Solar's player rolls (the appropriate Social Attribute + Investigation) when the Exalt invokes Irresistible Questioning Technique. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on the target. The target can resist with MDV. If the roll succeeds, the target is compelled to answer the Exalt's questions honestly. Resisting costs one Willpower per five minutes, to a maximum of three Willpower, and the compulsion lasts for one scene.
   This Charm loses effectiveness with repeated use. Increase the target's MDV by three if an Exalt has used Irresistible Questioning Technique or a similar Charm on the target this story.

      <description>The Lawgivers understand the harmonies of the world. This Charm allows the character to detect others' importance or wealth with a glance. This Charm targets one individual the character can sense. The Exalt's player rolls (Perception + Investigation), adding the Solar's Essence in automatic successes. If the target is concealing his identity or Resources in any way, subtract an external penalty of ([the target's Manipulation + Socialize] / 2) from the successes on the Investigation roll. If the Exalt succeeds, she learns the target's Resources and Influence ratings. In addition, she can make a rough but solid estimate of how many allies the target considers himself to have in the immediate circumstances and how much wealth and power the target wields through organization-specific Backgrounds such as Backing and Followers. The Solar may not attempt to use this Charm on a given target more than once per scene.</description>

      <description>TechniqueIn the savage world that is Creation, everyone has a price. Even those whom jade coin cannot buy will sell themselves for something - sex, fame, the reclaimed honor of an ancestor or the salvation of the world. The Exalt uses this Charm immediately after interacting with a target. The Solar's player rolls (Perception + Investigation). The difficulty for this roll is 1, but subtract an external penalty of ([the target's Manipulation + Socialize] / 2) from the successes on the Investigation roll. On a success, this Charm forces the target's player to declare the target's price. If the Exalt meets that price, this Charm invokes an unnatural Servitude effect - the target becomes loyal to the Exalt and must spend one Willpower per scene to act in a knowingly disloyal fashion. This servitude lasts until the Exalt betrays the bargain - as by reclaiming an object given as the price - or the target has spent a total of 10 Willpower to act disloyally.</description>

      <description>The superior detective is aware that the physiognomy of a subject may reveal that subject's history. The Lawgiver knows this and more, for he may see into souls. The character makes a quick study of a subject, allowing him to see his target's genetic inheritance so acutely that he may discern their ethnicity and even the bloodline from which they arose - commensurate with his Lore rating. The character's discernment of heredity is so keen that he can tell which gente's bloodline a Terrestrial descends from at a glance.
   As the Lawgiver grows in experience, so does this Charm's capabilities. At Investigation 5+, Essence 5+, the Solar catches physiognomic cues more readily; he can know if people are genetically related just by looking at them, and in what manner; or what a Dragon-Blooded target's Breeding is and exactly who the Terrestrial is descended from. The Lawgiver is also able to see into spirits; by glancing into a person's eyes or speaking to them for any length of time, the Lawgiver can see who they were in their former life.
   At Investigation 6+, Essence 6+, the Solar need only look at someone while using this Charm to see directly into their soul: the Exalt can see his target's past 10 incarnations. By using Legacy-Detecting Glance at this level while speaking with Celestial Exalted, the character's past life memories begin to resonate with the Exaltation before him, discerning the previous bearer of the subject's Exaltation. If the Lawgiver were to handle an Exaltation in Lytek's office directly while using this Charm, he could discern the identity of every person to have contained that exaltation. At Investigation 7+, Essence 7+, the Lawgiver can use this Charm to see directly into a targeted Chosen's Exaltation and discern all of the bearer's past incarnations; alternately, he may examine the subject's soul and witness its last 100 incarnations. At Investigation 8+, Essence 8+ the Solar may examine a subject's soul and trace its reincarnation history all the way to the beginning.
   When activating this Charm, the Solar may choose to look into the genetic, mimetic, or Exalted history of his subject, but not all three at once.
   The benefits of this Charm extend beyond genealogical trivia. If the Solar knows Evidence-Discerning Method and has ever used it to profile any previous incarnation of the subject's soul or Exaltation, he automatically recovers that profile and may employ Evidence-Discerning Method against the subject for a cost of 1m.

      <description>The Solar's Evidence-Discerning Method is permanently enhanced, strengthening her understanding of those she has profiled. The Charm's Duration becomes Instant; profiles no longer require committed Essence to grant a mechanical benefit. A profile remains valid until the subject's Motivation or Virtues permanently change (temporary changes brought about by magic will not spoil a profile).
   At Essence 5+, the Solar may roll (Wits + Investigation) one month before an individual he has profiled is planning to undertake any sort of premeditated larcenous enterprise (examples might include robbing a bank, staging a kidnapping, attempting an assassination, or, in the case of the Yozis, escaping from Hell). This roll has a difficulty of half the subject's (Intelligence + Larceny), rounded down. Success grants the Solar an idea of what the subject plans to do, including at least the general location and nature of the crime. Examples include: "Splendid Magister is planning to illegally experiment on hun souls within a private, hidden manse on the Blessed Isle", "the Ebon Dragon is going to try to break out of Hell with the assistance of a Yozi cult in Denandsor", or "Tammuz is going to attempt to murder his Solar Mate aboard a pleasure yacht". The Charm introduces plots to unravel, rather than solving them for the Solar in and of itself.
   At Investigation 6+, Essence 6+ the Lawgiver may also make this roll to realize from subtle context clues whenever a profiled subject comes within (Investigation x 5) miles of him. The Solar may also anticipate non-premeditated larcenous actions at this level, though he suffers a -5 external penalty on attempts to do so.

      <description>A Lawgiver can stop the hands of time to protect the ones he loves. This Charm allows the character to find evidence of crimes that have yet to be committed, thereby preventing future tragedies. The Solar may make (Wits + Investigation) rolls to detect impending threats to any person or location he has an Intimacy toward, even those posed by individuals he has not profiled. The difficulty of this roll is always 5. This warning manifests itself one week before the danger actualizes itself. For example: "The mercantile district of Hollow will be destroyed by a magically-triggered earthquake" or "My Lunar mate will be slain by another Exalt". Spending one Willpower when the roll is made grants the Solar a flash of intuitive insight gleaned through context clues in his surroundings - the Storyteller informs the Solar's player of a place where he might profitably begin investigating the impending disaster.
   As the Era of Dreams progresses, a growing number of Solars have stopped using this Charm, suspecting some defect in its design - surely Lawgiver's Parable Defense must be in error when it points to the Solars themselves as the threats that menace the things they love.

Portraits, hologlyphic reproductions, magical projections and remote scrying will not trigger Unblinking Sentinel Gaze.
   At Essence 5+ this Charm's cost drops to one mote and its duration may be extended to Indefinite.

      <description>Solar Exalted appraise the righteousness of others with a glance. A Lawgiver using this Charm gains the following powers:
• Whenever another character the Solar can perceive channels a Virtue or one of her Virtues affects her MDV in social combat, the Lawgiver's player learns the rating of the Virtue in question.
• The Lawgiver adds +2 bonus successes to all efforts to read the Motivation of another character, provided he discerned one or more of her Virtue ratings using this Charm earlier in the scene.
• Characters suffer an MDV penalty of -4 instead of -2 whenever the Solar makes a social attack exploiting one of their Virtues. This benefit only applies if the Lawgiver discerned the exploited Virtue rating using this Charm earlier in the scene, and only if the social attack has exactly one target.
      </description>
      <comment>
   It's Over 9000!
   When Charms and other powers reveal the numerical rating of any character's trait, only the discerning character's player learns the actual number. The character experiences the information as a narrative instinct, accurate enough to differentiate ratings without breaking the fourth wall to conceptualize the values as objective statistics.

      <description>After the Usurpation, the last of the Iron Wolves used this Charm to move in secret among the armies of the Dragon-Blooded. This Charm involves creating a disguise, and the player rolls ([Wits or Manipulation] + Larceny) to determine the disguise's quality.
   This Charm allows the character to change his coloration, skin texture, hair color, and eye color. It also lets the character seem anywhere between half and twice his actual age, change his apparent ethnicity, change his apparent gender and adjust his height by as much as 10% in either direction. The character can adjust his voice, accent, speaking style and scent to match. These aspects of the disguise are impenetrable - the flaws are too subtle for the eye to see or the ear to hear, so that ordinary Awareness and Investigation cannot detect them. Characters with inhuman sensory acuity, such as Lawgivers using Keen Sight Technique or a dog scenting its master, can see through the character's disguise, but the opposed roll incurs a +4 difficulty penalty.
   This Charm does not help the character imitate others' appearance. The disguise is impenetrable, not exact. If someone sees through an imitation, they will see the character as an imposter who happens to naturally look almost exactly like the target the character is impersonating.
   This Charm becomes a mundane disguise effect when the magic ends. Changes worked with makeup, posture, attitude and costume rather than Essence remain.

      <description>The Solar Exalted know the secrets of others' hearts. This Charm involves creating a disguise, and the Solar's player rolls ([Wits or Manipulation] + Larceny) to determine the disguise's quality. This Charm functions as Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise, save that it has a shorter duration, a higher cost and two additional abilities.
   First, the character can halve or double his apparent Essence -as seen by creatures capable of perceiving such things - and can appear to possess a mystical trait to the extent that he can emulate its mechanical effects. For example, an Essence 4 character could disguise himself as an Essence 8 god. If that god's hair writhes and the god floats an inch above the ground, the character convincingly models these traits. He does not actually float, however.
   Second, if the character has sufficient familiarity to disguise himself as someone else and that person's appearance is within the limits of this Charm, the character can perfectly imitate that person. Characters with ordinary senses cannot use Awareness or Investigation to see through this disguise, and even characters with inhuman sensory acuity - such as Lawgivers using All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight to spot the disguise Charm or demons recognizing the master to whom they are bound - have a +4 difficulty penalty on the opposed roll to penetrate the disguise.
   Note that, because ordinary Investigation cannot see through this disguise, the character has all the important distinguishing features of the imitated target - mannerisms, scent, accent and all. He does not know things that only the target can know, however, so he cannot give passwords or issue countersigns. He is flawless at covering up his ignorance when someone attempts to ferret him out, though.

      <description>It is the Lawgivers' right to confiscate goods necessary to the service of the Unconquered Sun. This Charm enhances a valid pickpocketing roll - that is, a roll to steal something that the character can both reach and carry from another's person. The character cannot steal things in active use, such as the sword in someone's hand, the boots from the target's feet or an artifact to which someone has committed motes, unless the target is an extra.
   This Charm guarantees success on the pickpocketing roll. If another Charm contests this effect, add the character's Essence in automatic successes to the (Dexterity + Larceny) roll to oppose the other Charm. In addition, characters using ordinary senses cannot spot the theft with Awareness. Even players of characters with inhuman sensory acuity - such as a spider feeling for the vibrations in its web while a character attempts to steal its larder - have a +4 difficulty penalty on the opposed roll to catch the character in the act.

      <description>In the First Age, the Solar Exalted used this Charm to steal the artifacts of the Fair Folk and the Yozis then turn them to the service of Creation. This Charm is an attempt to steal something in plain sight, within (the Solar's Essence) yards. The character must be able to carry the item, and the character cannot steal things in active use - again, including attuned artifacts - unless he is stealing from an extra's person. The character automatically succeeds in stealing the item. If another Charm contests this effect, add the character's Essence in automatic successes to the ([Dexterity or Wits] + Larceny) roll to oppose the other Charm.
   Characters using ordinary senses cannot spot the theft with Awareness. Nor may they notice the theft afterward until the Solar has refreshed his DV a number of times equal to his Essence score, barring unusual circumstances such as an attempt to use the item or the collapse of an arch after the character steals its keystone. Even players of characters with inhuman sensory acuity have a +4 difficulty on the opposed roll to notice the theft and a +8 difficulty on the unopposed roll to notice the item's absence.
   This Charm normally costs five motes. To steal an item that he could not reach - on the other side of a window, outside of the character's cell, at the bottom of a narrow crevice and so forth - the character must also spend 1 Willpower.

This Charm is a Move action with the normal movement allowance, which bypasses a single closed portal. The character must be able to move, and this Charm uses up the character's Move action for the tick. The character can move through a closed door, a fallen portcullis or a sealed grate as if it were not there. This Charm only allows movement through portals - that is, objects intentionally designed for people, animals or spirits to pass through them. The character cannot use this Charm to walk through walls, squeeze through arrow slits or fish around inside a sealed chest.</description>

      <description>Unfortunate times require such a defense as this. A Lawgiver may use this Charm to respond to any attempt to steal from him. By paying five motes, the character not only becomes aware of all items capable of being stolen from the target, but is also able to perfectly steal one item - potentially the one being stolen from him. At Essence 4+, the Lawgiver may use this Charm in response to attacks. This Charm has the same restrictions on objects which may be stolen as Stealing from Plain Sight Spirit, with the exception of an item being actively stolen from the Solar.</description>

      <description>Not all creators are as perfect as the Solars. In the magitech-rich Era of Dreams, haywire automaton servitors and war machines gone berserk must sometimes be dealt with. This Charm supplements an attempt to steal key parts from a machine in order to cripple or instantly disable it. The Exalt's hand flashes through the target, stripping out parts.
   If targeting an automaton (zombies are valid targets for this Charm), roll the Solar's (Dexterity + Larceny), resisted by the target's highest DV. Characters with Craft (Magitech) may add (their rating in that Ability) in automatic successes to this attempt. If successful, automaton extras and mechanical booby traps are instantly disabled, falling into a heap at the Solar's feet. Non-extra automatons instead take the Solar's (Wits + Larceny + threshold successes) dice of unsoakable aggravated damage.
   Targeting an artifact with a Repair rating requires the Solar to roll (Dexterity + Larceny), resisted by the user's highest DV. Until repaired, all attempts to use the damaged artifact suffer an external penalty equal to the Solar's threshold successes. If the artifact also requires maintenance, each threshold success counts as 100 hours of use.
   Alchemical Exalted and spirits which have the appearance of machines (such as Autochthon's Divine Ministers) are invalid targets for the purposes of this Charm's effects.

      <description>When a Solar allows another to hold the idea that they own something, he is being generous; when he grows bored of pretending, he simply takes what he wants. This Charm supplements a blatant attempt to strip something from an-other person (treat as a disarm attempt using Larceny in the place of a combat Ability). The character explicitly can steal things in active use, such as weapons, clothing, or even armor, so long as he can reach them, or any object on the target's person which he is aware of (examples might include a coin purse held in a clenched fist inside of a pocket, a sheathed sword the target is menacingly fingering the hilt of, or the target's undergarments).
   At Essence 5+, the Exalt may steal attuned artifacts, instantly breaking the artifact's attunement in the process.
   With Larceny 6+, Essence 6+, the Exalt may reflexively and instantly attune a stolen artifact by paying its commitment cost.
   With Larceny 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may use King of Thieves Spirit to steal Alchemical Charms, though he may not attune to them. At Larceny 8+, Essence 8+ even this restriction vanishes, and the Solar may equip and wield a stolen Alchemical Charm, if he has an open Charm Slot in which to place it.
   All attempts to steal armor suffer a -2 external penalty.

      <description>The diplomats of the Unconquered Sun write with a swift and elegant hand. This Charm supplements a dramatic action to write something down - be it a copy of an existing book, the transcript of a live conversation or an original work. This Charm allows the character to write at (her Essence x 10) times her normal speed. Instead of dedicating 30 hours to copying a manuscript, an Essence 2 character might finish it in an hour and a half. Instead of six hours writing and polishing a treaty, an Essence 3 Eclipse might prepare it in 12 minutes.</description>

      <description>Flawless Brush Discipline heightens the beauty of a Law-giver's script, making her every brushstroke ideal. Exalted using this Charm write with the hands of legendary sages and divine calligraphers. This Charm adds the character's permanent Essence to her Linguistics score to determine the beauty of the writing. In addition, this Charm causes the Lawgiver's words to exude a supernatural attraction. The Exalt's player rolls (Charisma + Performance) when recording her message. If the successes exceed the MDV of someone reading this work, the target is overcome with admiration or even love for the Exalt. This is an emotion caused by unnatural mental influence. The target must spend three Willpower to resist this effect or become committed (see p. 201) to the emotion that this Charm instills. If the target does not spend the three Willpower, the emotion lasts until the target breaks the commitment, and it costs one Willpower per scene to resist. Once affected, the target cannot suffer the effects of that Exalt's Flawless Brush Discipline again for one full year.</description>

      <description>Though the glorious Solar Exalted of the First Age are dead, many left secret messages for their heirs. This Charm allows the character to hide a message within another written work. Only the intended targets for the message can perceive it.
   The concealed message can include natural or unnatural mental influence. If so, the influence is an attempted surprise attack. Add the author's Linguistics in automatic successes to the Socialize roll to take the target by surprise.

      <description>The Solar heroes see through petty mysteries. This Charm lets the character understand encoded, obscured and hidden communication as if it were clear. For example, the Exalt can read weather-damaged stone tablets, recognize the signals in a coded exchange, browse ciphered manuscripts as if they were in their original language and make out the words of someone whose tongue has been cut in half. This Charm can oppose the concealing effects of Letter-Within-a-Letter Technique and similar Charms. The character is never surprised by social attacks while this Charm is in force.</description>

This Charm identifies the motivation behind a given statement that the Exalt reads or hears - a one-sentence summary of what the person making that statement hopes to gain. If the Exalt invokes this Charm to defend against a social attack and the attacker's purpose is fundamentally hostile to the Exalt or the Exalt's Motivation, this Charm perfectly negates the attack.</description>

      <description>The Solar heroes express their desires clearly. Language barriers do not stop them - their every gesture conveys their desired meaning. This Charm removes external penalties to dramatic actions and combat actions caused by the character not knowing others' languages. She can convey tactical and strategic necessities with expressive gestures and sounds. For example, she can easily convey "Duck!" or work with backwater natives to develop their agriculture. This Charm does not remove penalties to social or military actions, so the character will have a difficult time persuading or leading others - naturally or unnaturally - if she does not know their language.</description>

      <description>Essence enhances the Solar's language skills. This Charm allows the Solar to communicate and understand basic concepts in a language with which he has some experience but does not know. This requires a successful (Intelligence + Linguistics) roll for each five long ticks of conversation or page of written material, and the Solar must use a Linguistics Excellency. The difficulty is 5 if the Solar has a few days' experience studying or hearing the language. It rises to 7 if the Solar has a scene of experience studying or hearing the language. It's 10 if the Solar has only heard or read a few words. If the Solar uses this Charm to engage in social conflict in a language he does not understand, both the Solar and anyone he attempts to persuade receive a +3 to their MDV.</description>

      <description>The cadences of the Solar's language are subtly compelling. This Charm supplements a written attempt to compel or deceive others. It makes the persuasion attempt involved unnatural. The player rolls (Manipulation + an appropriate social Ability). This effects a compulsion or illusion on anyone who reads the written text and whose MDV the successes exceed. The target must spend three Willpower to resist this effect or become committed (see p. 201) to the intention or belief the Solar wishes to instill. If the target does not spend the three Willpower, the influence lasts until the target breaks the commitment and costs one Willpower per scene to resist. This Charm loses effectiveness with repeated use. Increase the target's MDV by three if an Exalt has used Twisted Words Technique or a similar Charm on the target this story.</description>

      <description>The Solar's words blaze with power, fascinating others. This Charm is a dramatic action to speak before a crowd. It flares the Solar's anima to the 16+ mote level while in use. The rhythm and poetry of the Solar's words become a transcendent numinous experience for those who hear him speak.
   This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on all who hear, compelling them to listen raptly. This is automatically successful unless opposed by a defensive Charm. In addition, the Exalt's player rolls (Charisma + Linguistics), and if the successes defeat a target's MDV, that target is compelled to fall to his knees in awe, weep with rapture or otherwise react as appropriate to the presence and oration of a creature greater than a god. To resist one or both compulsions for a single action, the target must either have his player succeed on a Temperance roll, or he must spend one Willpower. The target need never spend more Willpower than the Solar's Essence in any given scene to resist Unbreakable Fascination Method.
   This Charm ends when the Solar interrupts his speech for any reason other than a dramatic pause - that is, when he takes some other action.

This Charm may be explicitly placed in a Combo with any Training-Keyword Charm, even in violation of standard Combo rules, permitting those effects to be encoded into the resultant magical training manual.</description>

      <description>This versatile Charm allows lawgivers to radically compress magical instruction while simultaneously encoding the theories or biases of the scribe into the lesson. The character meditates upon a Charm or spell she knows, and then designs a single glyph encompassing the totality of her understanding of the effect. This glyph transcends language and its meaning may be effortlessly intuited by any character capable of learning the Charm or spell the glyph is based upon. Beautiful Essence-Born Runes contain more than instructions in the use of a Charm or spell, however; when created, they are also designed to encompass additional lessons desired by their creator. In game terms, each glyph contains one Charm or spell, and one Intimacy. Thereafter, characters who study the glyph may learn the spell or Charm coded into it a single scene, as a Training effect. However, the character also gains the Intimacy coded into the Charm, and it is fundamentally embedded into her understanding of the magic. The learned Charm or spell may not be used while the recipient does not harbor the encoded Intimacy. This restriction may be overcome, eventually, by spending an additional 2xp.
   Designing a rune takes only (minimum Essence of effect) hours of effort, and a character may design an unlimited number of runes. Actually scribing the rune requires an investiture of Essence, as reflected in the Charm's cost.

      <description>This Charm empowers the Lawgiver to invent a new language, which she may then encourage mortals to adopt. The golden tongues created by this Charm reinvent the thinking of those who speak it. The Solar chooses:
• One specialty to bestow
• One Ability to diminish
• A number of Intimacies to build or erode equal to her Linguistics
• A number of hampered traits equal to her Linguistics
• A number of assisted traits equal to her (Linguistics / 2)
   After a month of primarily speaking the language, a person permanently gains the specialty, but loses a dot from the diminished Ability (and is refunded its experience cost, if he had any dots to lose). He counts hampered traits as being one higher for determining experience costs and trait maximums. He treats assisted traits as being one lower for those same purposes. Every scene a character speaks this language counts as a scene of building or eroding one of the encoded Intimacies.
   Golden tongues lose potency if their purity is diminished. Linguistic drift must be battled constantly by the vigilant Lawgiver. This Charm may be repurchased an unlimited number of times, to design additional golden tongues. Essence-users are immune to this Charm's effects.

      <description>With a touch of his hand the Solar's Essence renders a message imperishable. This Charm may enchant anything from a wall of graffiti to an entire book, as long as that surface bears a message the character wishes to preserve. While Essence remains committed to the Charm, the letters cannot be erased or defaced. If the enchanted words are contained in a medium designed to hold writing (such as a book or scroll), that object becomes indestructible for the Charm's duration. Messages scrawled onto surfaces intended for some other purpose are only impossible to remove or deface. The underlying object or structure may still be destroyed, though merely damaging it will not reduce the words' legibility. The enchanted words shine through anything placed over them as though they were a Solar caste mark shining at the four- to seven-mote level of display, and are faintly luminous in the dark.</description>

      <description>Enlightened Lawgivers bring wisdom to the masses. This Charm involves training an organized social group such as a class, ministry or guild. This action requires five or more hours of effort in any given week to bear fruit. In each week of training, the trainer picks one trait to train: Conviction, Temperance, Perception, Intelligence, Craft (Air, Earth, Fire, Water or Wood), Investigation, Lore, Linguistics, Performance, Presence or Socialize. This Charm increases that trait for each member of the unit by one dot, to a maximum of 4. The Solar can train with the group or as a solo character, increasing her own traits. She cannot increase others' traits past her own.</description>

      <description>In the First Age, Lawgivers used the Wyld-Shaping Technique to conquer the Wyld and expand Creation. They stood at the edge of the world and forced shape into the teeth of the howling storm. This Charm forces a region of chaos to take form as the Exalt commands.
   Wyld-Shaping Technique is an extended dramatic action. The dice pool used equals (the Solar's Intelligence + Lore). Each roll requires five hours of effort, and the character pays the Charm's cost with each roll. This roll has a base difficulty of 1 in regions of Pure Chaos, 3 in the Deep Wyld, 5 in the Middlemarches and 10 in the Bordermarches of the Wyld.
   The Lawgiver can spend accumulated successes at any point to complete part of her construction. This functions as follows.
   Demesne: To forge a demesne, the Solar must first create the land and then spend successes equal to its demesne level.
   Land: To create a stable region - such as land - the Solar must spend successes equal to its Resources value. She can spend up to five successes at a time. This does mean that creating fertile land and mineral resources requires more effort per acre than blasted plains, desolate marshes and lifeless ocean. The Solar can use Wyld-Shaping Technique in this region as if it were the Middle-marches of the Wyld, but all other effects consider it a Tainted Land - touched by Wyld energy, but a part of Creation.
   Magical Things: To create a manse or artifact, the Solar applies the successes on this roll directly as Craft successes in manse or artifact construction. This Charm cannot speed the construction process more than tenfold, but the character is specifically permitted to supplement this process with Craft Charms such as Craftsman Needs No Tools.
   People: To create extras, the Solar spends successes equal to the number of Background dots necessary to have them as followers. To create useful Essence 1 servants, the Solar spends one success per servant. Increase the required successes by one if the character is creating a coherent military unit, social group or government out of the chaos. The Solar can spend up to five successes at a time.
   Wealth: To create portable wealth, the Solar must spend successes equal to its Resources value. She can spend up to five successes at a time.
   Things made by this Charm are not real in and of themselves. Their reality stems entirely from Creation - from the reality of the Lawgivers, the Imperial Mountain and the Loom of Fate. As long as the created things continue to interact with Creation or the Exalted, as through the magical trade networks established in the First Age to tame the Wyld, they survive.
   If something created by this Charm fails to interact extensively with the things of Creation during a story, it begins to lose its reality. Roll its creator's Essence against either difficulty 1 or, if the Solar's creation does not interact with real things that story at all, difficulty 2. After three failures without any extensive interaction with Creation or an Exalt, something created by this Charm fades away entirely.
   Creatures made using Wyld-Shaping Technique are outside Creation's processes of life and death. They do not reincarnate in Creation or as a real creature unless Heaven orders their pattern woven into the Loom of Fate. Nor do they form ghosts unless the Neverborn intervene to recreate their Essence pattern as such. They fade away upon their deaths and are no longer valid targets for Charms or other effects unless otherwise stated.

      <description>The Lawgiver may craft reality from the Wyld. This Charm enhances the Exalt's Wyld-Shaping Technique, allowing the character to make permanent and real things.
   Land/Wealth: The character can make real land or wealth with Wyld-Shaping Technique. This follows the normal rules, but the character must make a sacrifice - normally, a quantity of orichalcum or jade with Resources value equal to the Resources value of the creation. The character cannot sacrifice functional artifacts. The character can instead spend (Resources value x 2) in experience points, carving the necessary land or wealth out of his soul.
   Magical Things: If the character builds a manse or artifact out of materials imported from Creation, the result is real - it does not lose its reality as described above.
   People: The character can change a person or a social group with Wyld-Shaping Technique. Doing so subtracts an external penalty equal to the target's MDV from the successes on the character's Wyld-Shaping roll. If the character succeeds, she may change the target's Motivation and impose a number of points of Wyld mutations equal to the Solar's Essence. The target can resist this change by spending four Willpower. The target can alternatively spend two Willpower and state a short condition, such as "do not make me hideous" or "do not make me a traitor", which limits the Solar's options but does not prevent the effect. Storytellers can veto conditions such as "do not change me at all". Targets of this Charm must be present in the Wyld and within (Essence x 10) yards of the Solar.

      <description>The Lawgivers restore the hidden patterns of the soul. This Charm targets an individual, whom the Solar must touch. The Lawgiver spends 15 motes and an amount of Willpower equal to the target's permanent Essence. This Charm shatters all Shaping effects on the target, including long-term or permanent effects such as Wyld mutations and Sidereal astrology. The target is immune to further Shaping effects for the remainder of the scene.
   Using this Charm outside the Wyld on one of the Fair Folk destroys the target. The dream-wrought bodies of the Fair Folk are a Shaping effect, and this Charm renders them into statues, dreams, objects, animals or ordinary humans at the Storyteller's discretion. Note that the Exalt must successfully touch Fair Folk to use this Charm against them.

      <description>The Solar draws strength from the harmonious governance of Creation. The greater the social structure he commands, the more Essence he may wield. This Charm allows the Solar to recover motes by tending to the affairs of a kingdom, organization or social or military unit he leads. Each hour spent inspiring the people or performing administrative tasks allows the Solar to recover motes equal to the unit's Magnitude.
   In addition, each purchase of this Charm increases the character's Peripheral Essence pool by 10 motes. This Essence cannot be committed to an artifact. The character cannot recover this Essence normally - he can refill this pool only through the technique above and with Essence-recovery Charms. The player may purchase this Charm a total number of times equal to the Exalt's Essence.

Channeling Essence through her sagacious knowledge, the Solar is able to revive a legendary wonder and temporarily restore it to functionality. The Solar may restore a broken or damaged artifact to full working order so long as Essence is committed to sustain this Charm. In order to use this Charm, the Solar must know what the artifact in question is and what it does.</description>

      <description>The Solar's Harmonious Academic Methodology is permanently enhanced by her greater enlightenment. The Solar may now use her instruction to enlighten mortals, granting them the enlightened essence blight (see The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II - The Wyld, p. 148). She also abolishes the 4-dot training cap from Harmonious Academic Methodology and Legendary Scholar Curriculum; only the age and Essence of her students limits their potential to absorb knowledge at the Solar's feet. She may also use Harmonious Academic Methodology to impart knowledge of thaumaturgy, sorcerous initiation Charms, or spells, assuming her students are capable of using such magic.</description>

      <description>The concepts which engender the universe fall readily into the grasp of the Solar Exalted. Emptying himself of all thought and desire, the Lawgiver becomes a vessel for the knowledge of the shinma. Entering a trance state, his eyes become unblinking lanterns and his caste mark appears, glowing the same stark white for one full day. During this time, the Solar subtly alters universal principles with the force of his will, to great effect. The character may use Shinmaic Communion to target a landscape he has created with Wyld-Shaping Technique, redefining its relationship with the great cosmic elements known as the shinma. The character gains ten 'points' with which to edit the region in accordance to his will, which may be spent on the following modifications:
• Nirupadhika, the Way, governs spatial relationships. For one point the Solar may enchant the roads in the region such that they prevent travelers moving along them from getting lost, or infallibly lead them to specific places regardless of where they intend to travel. Two points allow the Solar to speed up or slow down travel according to his design; by default, this halves or doubles travel times, though each point invested beyond the initial two raises this by a factor of one. Three points may designate points within the region as impossible to miss, or occlude them so that all efforts to find them suffer an external penalty equal to half the Solar's Lore. Four points make the region mobile, able to move (Solar's Lore miles / day). Each additional point spent on mobility doubles the region's movement rate. Five points doubles the interior size of the region without altering the size of its borders -the region is simply bigger on the inside. Each additional point spent on this aspect increases the region's size by a factor of one.
• Dharma, the Cup, governs corrosion, ignorance and desire. For one point, staying within the region for at least one week counts as a scene spent building an Intimacy of hatred toward a particular social group not native to the region. Two points cause each week spent within the region to count as a scene eroding an Intimacy of the Solar's choice. Three points create a tenor of desire within the region ac-cording to the Solar's definition; all actions which directly reject this desire are taken at a -2 internal penalty, while all actions in pursuit of it enjoy a +1 circumstantial bonus die. Four points produce a regional agenda - the Solar defines an Intimacy, and each time an individual sleeps within the region, this counts as a scene spent building that Intimacy. Five points hide knowledge about a particular thing from those within the region, inflicting an external penalty equal to (Solar's Lore / 2) on all attempts to uncover information about the thing; alternately, the Solar may ensure that anyone who seeks a certain thing will find it. This thing must exist within the region, be intangible, of limitless supply, and likely to bring the individual significant turmoil in the future. Valid examples, then, might include worldly insight, occult secrets, or love.
• Nirvishesha, the Ring, governs identity. One point raises or lowers the region's level of Wyld infection by one stage, for example changing a Tainted Land to a stretch of Bordermarches. Two points summon a certain common variety of little god or minor elemental to flock to the region, according to the Solar's will (consider the differences between a region full of field gods as compared with one full of bloody hands). Three points may create or close a shadowland within the region, with a diameter no greater than one mile. Four points may create an Essence bias within the region with the same range of flavors as demesnes enjoy (the five elements, Solar, Lunar, vitriol, etcetera). Beings matching this Essence bias raise their hourly respiration rate by four motes. Five points may alter the cycle of life and death within the region. This may guarantee that all souls go on to lethe, linger as ghosts, or plunge into Oblivion; or it might create a closed reincarnation loop, where all residents who enter lethe within the region are guaranteed to reincarnate somewhere within its borders.
• Nishkriya, the Sword, governs conflict. For one point, the region takes on a martial tenor - its people slowly become more generally warlike and inclined to the ways of battle. Each season spent within the region acts as a scene of building a positive intimacy of some kind toward conflict into the Policy of all social groups. For two points, the region becomes a magnet for conflict - it will begin to produce natural resources needed or coveted more by the region's neighbors than by the region itself. For three points, the region becomes a den of brotherly raiders - all military units raised within the region have a Drill one higher than normal, and all individuals enjoy a +2 situational bonus to all attempts to take something from another person or group by force. Four points formidably defends the region against invasion - its animals attack intruding military forces, and the land itself rises up in protest, causing all movement to be across what is considered difficult terrain, and producing a -1 external penalty to all military activities by invaders. Five points tithed to Nishkriya turns the region into a weapon against hostile forces attempting to move into the Lawgiver's domain, raining down at least one environmental attack per hour against any invading military unit, of a sort devised by the Solar - avalanches, rains of lightning, supernatural ice storms and localized earthquakes are only the beginning of the woes that may be hurled at unwelcome guests.
• Nirvikalpa, the Staff, is the medium through which communication occurs. One dot makes the region a gathering place for societies, by increasing its yield of timber or making it more fecund farmland. Two dots make the region a magnet for commerce, increasing the amount or value of mineral resources found within. Three dots make the region a point of interaction between its inhabitants and the supernatural world, by seeding the region either with raw materials capable of being refined into the magical materials, or with those materials directly. Four dots makes the region a point of communion between Creation and Heaven, by causing each prayer uttered within the region to count as though it had been spoken from five mouths rather than one. Five dots makes the region a communication network between Creation and itself, drawing dragon lines together to create a three-dot demesne. This value may be raised by one dot per additional point invested.
   The Solar is not obligated to spend 'left-over' points, if he does not wish to do so. A region may only be affected by one use of Shinmaic Communion at a time; additional uses cancel any existing alterations and overwrite them. Shinmaic Communion's effects vanish upon the Solar's death, unless a surcharge of one permanent point of Willpower is paid upon the Charm's activation.
   This Charm may be purchased up to (Lore) times. Each purchase after the first grants two additional points to spend on shinmaic alterations.

      <description>Having communed with the foundational elements of the cosmos, the Solars forge miracles. This Charm must be activated in a region the Solar has altered with Shinmaic Communion. The character defines a wondrous aspect or blessing for inclusion within the region. Much like artifact crafting, this Charm is conceptually broad and depends on cooperation between players and Storytellers to design uncanny wonders that later Ages will disbelievingly mythologize and dream of. The parameters of the effect depend on the Shinmaic Communion elements affecting the region this Charm is used in.
• Nirvikalpa determines the power of the miracle. One point affecting the region permits the Solar to produce works equivalent to mundane effort. Two points may produce uncanny effects equivalent to thaumaturgy. Three points produce wonders equivalent to Terrestrial Circle sorcery. Four points are equivalent to the Celestial Circle, and five points may produce awe-inspiring effects comparable to Solar Circle sorcery. Zero points limits the effects to only the weakest happenstance, the equivalent of mood lighting - effects with no mechanical repercussions at all.
• Nishkriya determines the strategy of the miracle. Each point of Nishkriya invested in the region allows one trigger to be built into the miracle. Examples of potential triggers include "entering the region", "praying to the Yozis", "sleeping within the region", "stealing from a merchant", "marching under the flag of a foreign power," or "disguising one's identity".
• Dharma determines who the miracle affects. One point permits only a very limited subset of a population - old men of Varangian descent. Two points allows the miracle to affect a population - Varangians. Three points permits a category of magical beings to be targeted (such as gods, or Dragon-Blooded). Four points affect all individuals who wish to be affected. Five points allows the miracle to target everyone within the region. Zero points limits the miracle to working upon the environment; it cannot affect people at all.
• Nirvishesha determines how long the miracle persists. One point causes the effect to last unto the third generation (60 years). Two points last unto the seventh generation (140 years). Three points last until the 30th generation (600 years). Four points last unto the 50th generation (1,000 years). Five points create a permanent miracle. Zero points invested in Nirvishesha produces a miracle lasting a single paltry year.
• Nirupadhika determines the scope of the miracle. One point affects all regions the Solar has shaped out of the Wyld within a single Direction. Two points affect all such regions he has shaped within the boundaries of Creation, and any realms of the Faraway which he has visited. Three points affect all of the above, as well as the entirety of Creation. Four points affect all of Creation as well as all directly adjoining realms (the Underworld, Malfeas, Yu-Shan, Autochthonia, the Wyld). Five points are conjectured to affect all of existence - even those conceptual frontiers the Exalted have yet to discover or invent. Zero points invested in Nirupadhika affects only the Shinmaic Communion-marked region in which the Charm is used.
   For example, a Solar might lay a blessing of protection on a region for seven generations, so that all invading armies are scoured at its borders by enormous pillars of white-hot sunfire and other horrifying manifestations of Adamant Circle destruction. This would require that the region be affected by two points under Nirvishesha, five under Dharma, five under Nirvikalpa, and two under Nishkriya. Or a Solar might attempt to permanently ennoble all the cosmos so that anyone attempting to initiate into the practice of sorcery will receive this tutelage by the world itself. This would require five points of Nirupadhika, five points of Nirvishesha, four points of Dharma, one of Nishkriya, and two points of Nirvikalpa.
   Crafting a miracle is an extended dramatic action using a dice pool of (Intelligence + Lore) with an interval of one day, a difficulty of (points of Nirupadhika used), and a cumulative difficulty of (total number of points used x 10). Abandoning the effort at any point before completion causes the effect to unravel harmlessly, and the Solar is refunded the xp cost of the Charm. A botch causes the miracle to erupt in some dangerous and unpredictable manner - at best, everyone in the region is likely to have a very interesting day.
   This Charm's miracles take effect automatically once crafting is complete, unless the Solar has utilized one or more points of Nirupadhika. In that case the miracle becomes what is known as a shinmaic potentiality or "Miracle Shell", an Essence-shaped working which exists in potential but does not interface with Creation. Greater arts than Shinmaic Calibration are required to integrate a Miracle Shell into reality - the Salinan Working is likely the most well-known example of such an integration.

   This Charm may be used only to give stalkers who possess one dot of Essence a second dot. It cannot be used to give Dragon Kings additional degrees of enlightenment. Until the stalkers' training is completed, the Solar must confine them, since they are savage and cunning beasts until they regain their reason.

      <description>The eyes of the Solar Exalted see the hidden truths of others' pains. This Charm lets the Solar automatically determine which of the target's observable traits and described symptoms are medically related. If the Solar uses this Charm in the process of a formal diagnosis, normally a dramatic (Perception + Medicine) action with a Speed of 5 long ticks, this Charm protects her from any error in diagnosis. If she has enough information, she accurately identifies each condition, its source and its additional effect. If she does not have enough information - as when a target that caught an unknown disease from eating infected human brains successfully conceals his cannibalism - she recognizes that some key piece of the puzzle is missing.</description>

      <description>Disease and corruption cannot stand against the Solars' healing light. Solar Exalted with this Charm can cure any Sickness effect. This Charm guarantees that any attempt Solars make to treat a sickness is considered supernatural. It halves the length of the patient's convalescence. If the Exalt's player rolls five or more successes on a Medicine roll for the Solar to treat an ordinarily incurable illness, such as the Great Contagion, she can spend five motes and banish it from the patient's system. Treating sickness in this fashion is a dramatic Medicine-based action that takes one hour unless sped by a stunt or Charm.</description>

      <description>The Lawgivers bring purgation and purity. Solar Exalted with this Charm can force even the most terrible Poison effects from the target's body. This Charm guarantees that any attempt they make to treat a poison is considered supernatural. If the Exalt's player rolls five or more successes on a Medicine roll for the Solar to treat an ordinarily incurable poison, such as spiritual taint, Yozi impregnation or even spells such as Blood of Boiling Oil, she can spend five motes and banish it from the patient's system. Treating poison in this fashion is a dramatic Medicine-based action that takes 20 minutes unless sped by a stunt or Charm.</description>

      <description>Essence can repair even severed limbs. Solar Exalted with this Charm can cure any Crippling effect. This Charm guarantees that any attempt they make to treat the effect is considered supernatural. If the Exalt's player rolls five or more successes on a Medicine roll for the Solar to treat an ordinarily incurable Crippling effect, such as limb amputation or Charm-induced paralysis, she can spend five motes and restore the patient. Treating Crippling injuries in this fashion is a dramatic Medicine-based action that takes one hour unless sped by a stunt or Charm. It takes the patient several days of convalescence to repair otherwise permanent damage such as lost limbs or blindness.</description>

      <description>Rarely is a Solar forced to leave a task unfinished. This Charm is a Medicine-based action in which the character treats a patient. The Charm functions exactly as any Medicine-based dramatic action that takes up to one hour, save that the character performs it in a handful of seconds. As with Contagion-Curing Touch, the medical shortcuts involved depend on the Exalt in question. This Charm does not remove the need for appropriate medicine, surgical tools and suchlike, but the Solar can use a stunt or Combo to work around these limitations.
   This Charm speeds only that portion of treatment that actively involves the physician. It does not accelerate any rest, recovery and convalescence the patient normally performs on his own. It can act as the dramatic action required by Charms such as Wholeness-Restoring Meditation and Wound-Mending Care Technique.

      <description>The Lawgiver need not only heal, but may recreate bodies as she sees fit. After she spends five hours performing a Medicine-based action (and making an Intelligence + Medicine roll), her target gains or loses points of physical mutations no greater than the Solar's successes. (See Exalted, pp. 288-290, The Manual of Exalted Power - The Lunars, pp. 206-209, and The Compass of Celestial Directions, Vol. II - The Wyld, pp. 144-148. Poxes and deficiencies are one point; afflictions/debilities, two points; blights/deformities, four points; abominations, six points.) This procedure inflicts a number of levels of lethal damage equal to the point value of the mutation bestowed (extras cannot die from this treat-ment unless the activation roll botches).
   This Charm can remove Wyld mutations, but the mutations it grants aren't usually of the Wyld. Unless the storyteller rules otherwise, mutations granted by this Charm don't restrict the target's ability to live in Creation.

      <description>Creation sets a grim course for those who cycle through it. By healing others, a Solar finds the power and resolve to continue her journey. The Lawgiver regains two motes per health level restored to another character through the application of her healing arts, so long as that character's wounds were not inflicted by the Solar or at the Solar's behest. Once per story, the Lawgiver may waive this benefit to instead reduce her Limit by one point.</description>

      <description>Transcending individual treatment, the Solar exercises sovereignty over disease, giving it form at her behest. The Solar selects a specific disease. All instances of the targeted disease within (Essence x 20) miles are immediately pulled from those who suffer from them, traveling at the speed of prayer to the Solar's location. There they coalesce over the course of one day, leaping together in a roiling mass of filth and shadow that eventually becomes a single, powerful plague god of that particular disease - one which harbors an indestructible Intimacy of loyalty to the Solar who caused it to come into being. The spirit may somewhat resemble the Solar in appearance. This god is equivalent to a spirit of the second rank or third rank, depending on the virulence and magnitude of the disease and its outbreak (see The Compass of Celestial Directions, vol. III - Yu-Shan, pp.122-124) The spirit always has the Bane Weapon Charm, which is efficacious against other spirits of the disease it represents, and a special Charm called Consume Sickness, which allows the spirit to spend 10 motes to draw out the sickness it represents from a person and consume it, gaining a point of Willpower or restocking a Virtue channel in the process. This Charm may only function if a number of individuals of Magnitude 6 or above are infected with the disease within the targeted area.</description>

      <description>This legendary Charm was employed only rarely in the First Age, as a reward for the most loyal of a Solar's mortal retinue, or to preserve a favorite servant or lover. It involves a complex, delicate 12-hour medical procedure that resets the Essence flows of the target's body and mends instabilities of the flesh. At the end of the process, the target is physically returned to the flower of youth - 18 years of age for humans, or the proportional equivalent for animals. The target retains all memories and skills. This procedure is efficacious only when used on behalf of mortals or animals, and it wears off after a year and a day, returning the target to his previous age unless the Solar chooses to renew the Charm's application with another 12-hour procedure. Alternatively, the Lawgiver's player may choose to spend one experience point in addition to the standard cost of the Charm, removing the need for upkeep. The target will then begin to age normally from the point of his "reset" youth.
   At Medicine 10, Essence 10, the experience point cost for enduring youth disappears. The Solar is still capable, though, of performing the Charm so that the target requires yearly maintenance.

      <description>The maneuver named Peony Blossom Attack burns significant Essence to unleash a powerful flurry of blows. The Lawgiver moves as smoothly and rapidly as ice on hot metal. This Charm is a magical flurry of two or more Melee-based attacks. Each attack costs two motes, including the first, and the Exalt can buy up to (her permanent Essence + 1) attacks. This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of the weapon's Rate, without multiple action penalties, and with a DV penalty equal to only the highest penalty for any one attack.</description>

         <comment>On Peony Blossom Attack: "'What?!' Yes, this is the new Peony Blossom Attack (and its Abyssal counterpart has been similarly changed). Peony Blossom is one of the holdover concepts from early first edition, when Charm trees were often designed as a series of speedbumps: you'd start with a weak version of a concept, followed by a stronger Charm which completely obviated its prerequisite by being better in all regards, so that you never used the old Charm again. Peony Blossom Attack was one of those Charms. As best I was able to determine, the only thing people used it for was to get low-impact, cheap three-hit extra actions once Invincible Fury of the Dawn locked onto it. Now it performs a new, useful function as a 'circle-slash' technique, useful for clearing out bodyguards or creating some breathing room in a press." -H</comment>

      <description>The maneuver named the Iron Whirlwind Attack conserves Essence but requires an utmost exertion of will. This Charm is a magical flurry of many Melee-based attacks. The Exalt makes a total number of attacks equal to (her Dexterity + 1). This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of the weapon's Rate, without multiple action penalties, and with a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any one attack.</description>

         <errText>At Essence 3+, the character may select to levy fewer than (Dexterity + 1) attacks against her target, to a minimum of zero attacks. She may also cancel her attack prematurely. For example, when attacking a target which has a tick-long counterattack effect, she may decide to end her flurry early to avoid further counterattacks.</errText>

      <description>The Essence of the Lawgiver manifests in a gleaming blade of the sun. This blade is always a glowing weapon that inflicts aggravated damage against creatures of darkness (seeboxed text) and sheds sunlight as bright as a torch. The Exalt can summon this weapon to her hand from anywhere it has fallen, as a dice-less miscellaneous action.
   The player defines the appearance of this blade when purchasing this Charm. She can also define its weapon qualities, as follows. If she chooses a light, agile blade with Speed 3, she can divide a number of points equal to the Solar's Melee score between its Accuracy, Defense and lethal damage. If she chooses a larger sword with Speed 5, she can divide a number of points equal to twice the Solar's Melee score between its Accuracy, Defense and lethal damage. In both cases, Accuracy, Defense and Damage begin at 0 and cannot be lowered. The player can change this choice and allocation only when the character raises her Melee score. This weapon has unlimited Rate.
   Characters can use this Charm to summon paired blades, one in each hand. Doing so increases the Charm's cost by four additional motes, to a total of 10 motes, one Willpower.
   Players wishing to have multiple options can purchase this Charm a number of times equal to the character's Melee. Each purchase defines a different blade with distinct properties.

This blade is always a glowing weapon that inflicts aggravated damage to creatures of darkness and sheds light as bright as a torch. The Exalt can summon this weapon to her hand from anywhere it has fallen, as a diceless, miscellaneous action.
   The character defines the form of her weapon upon purchasing this Charm. Statistically, the weapon has traits equal to single or paired basic 1, 2 or 3-dot close-range orichalcum artifact weapon (such as a daiklave, grimcleaver, or direlance) of the player's choice. Paired 1-dot weapons or a singular 2-dot weapon costs 3m. Paired 2-dot weapons or a single 3-dot weapon costs 5m. "Brawling aides" such as smashfists are not valid forms.
   Players wishing to have multiple options may purchase this Charm a number of times equal to their character's Melee score, creating a different weapon with each purchase.
   If the character possesses an Overdrive pool, she gains one offensive mote to that pool each action while she is actively wielding Glorious Solar Saber. The character must be in battle to benefit from the one mote drip. She may only benefit from one drip from weaponry at a time.

      <description>The maneuver named Iron Raptor Technique extends the Solar's reach. Her weapon flies toward the enemy like a hungry bird of prey, then returns at the Solar's call. This Charm is a Melee-based attack that costs two motes and can attack enemies up to (Essence x 8) yards from the Solar. It is in all other ways treated as a normal Melee attack.
   If the Exalt has Essence 3 or more, she can spend two additional motes for a total cost of four motes and throw a burning arc of energy from her weapon instead of the weapon itself. This is called the "Sandstorm-Wind Attack". It cannot be blocked without a stunt or Charm.

      <description>The character invokes this Charm in response to an attack. The attack must not be unexpected, and the character must have a weapon in hand. This Charm is a parry that perfectly defends against any attack, even if it is unblockable.
   Mundane weapons can break when used with this Charm. If the character uses this Charm and a mundane weapon to block an attack that inflicts at least 25L raw damage before soak, the weapon breaks (though it still successfully parries).
   This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability (see boxed text) common to all Solar perfect defenses.

      <description>The world weeps when the Chosen fall, and so, the Unconquered Sun has given them every mastery of defense. For the remainder of the scene, this Charm removes the onslaught penalty other characters' attacks impose on the Exalt's DV. It also reduces the defense penalty imposed by each action the Exalt takes by one, to a minimum of zero.</description>

      <description>This Charm allows the character to prepare a single invoca-tion of the Heavenly Guardian Defense maneuver in advance. The character can have at most one invocation prepared at any given time. The character invokes the Heavenly Guardian Defense Charm, paying the normal four motes. He can later use the Heavenly Guardian Defense against one attack of his choice, in any circumstance when using the Charm would be legitimate. Preparing the Charm counts as a Charm use, but invoking its abilities later does not. The motes remain committed until the Solar uses the Charm to block a single attack.
   If the Solar has Essence 6 or higher, he may prepare up to his Melee score in invocations of the Heavenly Guardian Defense,and the cost to activate that Charm is reduced to three motes.

         <errText>The Solar needs commit only a single mote to reserve a use of Heavenly Guardian Defense with this Charm. At the time Heavenly Guardian Defense is actually used, he must pay the remainder of its cost. (For example, an Essence 5 Solar would commit 1m to reserve a Heavenly Guardian Defense use, and then pay an additional 3m to activate the defense when he wished to use it).</errText>

         <description>The Lawgivers have returned into a world of peril and sorrow, a cruel age that threatens to destroy all that they cherish and hold dear. So long as there is a weapon in their hands, they can fight against this dark time, holding it forevermore at bay. As the Solar activates this Charm, he attunes his martial instincts to a single Melee weapon he wields, invoking an aurora of blue and gold flames to surround it with protective Essence. He takes no DV penalties from attacks made with the chosen weapon, and adds +2 to its Defense rating.
   The Solar may also use the enchanted weapon to perfectly parry any attack against him in Step 2, even if that attack is unblockable. Doing so ends this Charm prematurely, as the corona of protective Essence flares to supernova brilliance, and then fades away. Once the Solar has done so, he cannot reactivate this Charm for the rest of the scene, a limitation that counts as this defense's Flaw of Invulnerability. With Melee 5+, Essence 5+, the Solar may invoke this defense up to (Essence / 2) times in one scene before this Charm ends.

      <description>Capable of mastering all forms of combat, a Solar need not limit herself to a single weapon. This Charm represents the Lawgiver's mastery of and kinship with all forms of tactile artifact weaponry. When attuning multiple artifact weapons, the Solar commits Essence to the weapon with the highest attunement cost. All additional artifact weapons cost only a single mote to attune. The Solar may attune artifacts up to double the mote cost of the initial attunement. For example, she pays an attunement cost of five motes to attune a daiklave, and may now attune five additional weapons, each for a single mote, provided each weapon has a commitment cost equal to or less than five motes. If she attempts to add a weapon to her array which has a higher commitment cost than the most expensive of her current weapons, the original highest-cost weapon in her current panoply of attuned weapons transfers all but one mote to the new highest-cost weapon and the Solar attunes the new weapon by paying the difference.
   The Lawgiver may expressly use this Charm to reduce the attunement cost of artifact weapons for use with combat abilities other than Melee, however it does not reduce the cost to attune armor, N/A-rated artifacts or non-weapon artifacts.
   At Essence 4+, once the Solar has attuned enough weapons to double the commitment cost of the highest-cost weapon in her array, all additional artifact weapons have an attunement cost of zero motes. At Essence 5+, the power of her attunement expands further: the Lawgiver may reach the threshold of zero mote attunement after increasing her total commitment by only 50%, rounded up. For example, at Essence 5+ the Solar attunes a daiklave for five motes. The next three weapons she attunes will each cost a single mote, and all weapons beyond that will cost zero motes.

      <comment>"The notes for this Charm have been sitting in my Dawn case file (now closed and solved) for a good eight months. I really wanted to give it to you in Dreams, but I didn't want it to be a high-Essence Charm, and I didn't want to tip my hand on the direction I was going with the Dawn Solution. In any case, it wouldn't be nearly as useful to blend all your combat abilities if you could not attune multiple artifact weapons economically. Now you can. Enjoy."Ø</comment>

      <description>Like a diamond that knows its edges, the Solar is aware of all angles which affect the symmetry of perfect form. A Lawgiver with this Charm has honed his defensive skills to a superhuman degree; he knows the limits and reach of his weapons as if they were but extensions of his will. The character's Melee-derived Parry DV is permanently raised by 2; this bonus counts as dice added by a Charm.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted are living weapons; as they evolve into this role, they begin to manifest the very threat they pose to their enemies, until no angle of attack seems safe. Attacking a Lawgiver with this Charm is dangerous at best, for her very gestures, mannerisms, and glances carry all the import and possibility of a daiklave's edge. This Charm imposes a -1 external penalty on all attacks made against the Solar.</description>

      <description>Sensing the pulse of Essence along which an attack was fired, a Lawgiver may send a strike back at his opponent with perfect form and blazing speed. This Charm allows the Solar to respond to an attack with a Melee attack of his own. This attack has infinite range, ignores cover, and may be made even if the Solar is unable to see his target. If assailed by a ranged weapon, the source of the attack is rent by a razor-edged heat shimmer of Essence at his location. At Essence 6+ the Solar may use Blind Impulse Strike in response to social attacks he is aware of, so long as they occur within the same realm of existence. At Essence 7+ the Solar may use this Charm to respond to all social attacks, regardless of where the perpetrator is. Blind Impulse Strike may only be activated once in response to a written social attack, no matter how many times the Solar re-reads it.</description>

      <description>In every battle there is a perfect moment to strike; in the stillness of inaction-becoming-action, a fight may be decided by a mere speck in time: a choice to move or not move. The Solar knows these moments like brothers and summons them to hand like hawks, making all her choices perfect. Until her next action, a character under the effects of Flawless Mirror Trance gains the following benefits: she adds her Essence to her Melee-derived Parry DV; whenever she uses her Melee-derived Parry DV against an attack, she may make a Melee-based counterattack with (Essence) dice added to her regular attack pool in step 9; and she may use her Melee-based parry DV to parry unblockable attacks.</description>
      <comment>On Flawless Mirror Trance: "I designed this Charm to be used in combination with another Charm already mentioned, but I won't tell you which. I'm sure one of you will figure it out within 24 hours of this post. In case you were wondering, the clear / tranquil principles laid forth by Musashi were the inspiration for this Charm's description." -Ø</comment>

      <description>A Lawgiver's skill in combat evolves into an unshakeable truth with all the conviction of a religion. When her resolve is challenged, her holy blade becomes the answer to all her enemy's questions. This Charm enhances its prerequisite. The Solar may opt to pay a three mote surcharge when activating Heavenly Guardian Defense, extending its duration to One tick. Solars with Essence 5+ may extend the duration of Heavenly Guardian Defense to One action by paying a three mote, one Willpower surcharge. The Exalt's weapon is seen to leave burning golden-orange streaks in the air as it flashes out to meet all attacks. When using this Charm in conjunction with Defend Other, the Solar must activate this Charm multiple times to cover multiple allies, paying the Charm's activation cost and surcharge separately for each target she wishes to defend for One tick or One action. This Charm may not enhance activations of Heavenly Guardian Defense pre-loaded through Protection of Celestial Bliss.</description>

      <description>With a flash from his blade, the Solar sears a burning image into the mind of his enemy. A character who activates this Charm unleashes a glint of perfect light, caught in the motion of his weapon.
   This Charm creates a ranged Melee attack against a single target up to (Essence x 10) yards away. A flash of light, accompanied by a hollow, glassy pop, stuns the victim. This attack is guaranteed to land; it will strike the target with a threshold of at least zero successes. However, Edge of Morning Sunlight does not inflict health level damage. Instead it blinds and dazes the target, inflicting a -1 internal penalty to the target's combat actions for every health level of damage it would have inflicted. This debilitating condition lasts for (Essence x 2) ticks. When placed in a Combo, any attack which includes Edge of Morning Sunlight inflicts no damage. Finally, Edge of Morning Sunlight is not Stackable, and may only be used against the same target once every five actions.If used to target a creature of darkness, the Solar adds his Essence to the attack's accuracy.

      <description>The holy wrath of an enraged Lawgiver is a thing to behold. Channeling his martial skill into a burning aura of killing force that blazes bright red in his anima, the Solar increases the power of this Charm's prerequisites. The Solar may pay an additional five motes, one Willpower when using either of those Charms to activate Corona of Radiance. Doing so repeats the damage application (Step 10) of those Charms (Essence +3) times against a single target. Alternately, the Solar may use this Charm to launch Blazing Solar Bolt or Edge of Morning Sunlight against (Essence + 3) opponents simultaneously (making a different roll against each target). A repurchase of this Charm at Essence 7+ allows the Solar to pay a seven mote, one Willpower surcharge to split this attack against (Essence + 3) opponents and resolve damage against each of them (Essence + 3) times.
   When enhanced by Corona of Radiance, Edge of Morning Sunlight gains the Stackable Keyword.

      <description>Never again shall a Lawgiver suffer being apart from her blades. A character with this Charm may pay one mote to indefinitely store (Essence x 2) weapons Elsewhere, including close- and long-range weapons. This Charm also expressly permits the storage of shields. Thousand Arms Prana is Stackable; the Solar may reflexively store as many weapons as she wishes Elsewhere, at a rate of one mote per (Essence x 2) weapons. In order to retrieve a weapon stored in this manner, the Solar must concentrate on that weapon and pay an additional mote, causing the weapon to fall to the ground at her feet. The character may also use Charms such as Elegant Dance of Bow and Blade to draw her weapons from Elsewhere.
   As long as the Solar maintains an Essence commitment to this Charm, she may sheath weapons in Elsewhere without cost, up to her storage limit. Releasing the motes committed to storing her weapons in Elsewhere causes them to fall to the ground around the character in a circle ([Essence x 2] x [number of committed motes released]) yards in diameter. Her weapons do not become immediately tangible, but rather they glow with ghostly blue-white flames, and though they appear to be embedded all throughout the scenery, they can neither be grasped nor moved by anyone but the Lawgiver for one hour, after which the flames disperse and the weaponry rejoins existence. Should she commit motes back to Thousand Arms Prana before the hour's end, she may instantly banish her emblazoned weaponry with a thought if she so chooses, or may otherwise place new weaponry into Elsewhere for the duration of this commitment. If the Solar grasps an emblazoned weapon at any point before the hour ends, the weapon immediately re-enters existence and becomes tangible to characters other than the Solar. Should a Lawgiver die while using this Charm, her weapons do not spring from Elsewhere, but rather float through the pocket-space of not-here, individual weapons falling into Creation and other realms of existence across (Essence) months from the character's death.
   Finally, purchasing this Charm grants the Solar an experience point refund for the cost of its prerequisite.

Using this Charm raises the character's Melee-derived Parry DV by 1 for one tick. This bonus does not count as dice added by a Charm and ignores maximum DV limitations. Furthermore, any time a character using Final Sunset Stance successfully parries an attack with this DV, she stocks a free reflexive attack which she may withhold or unleash at a moment of her choosing. Free reflexive attacks may not be accrued with the aid of Charms bearing a Flaw of Invulnerability. Unused stocked attacks vanish from the Solar's arsenal when the scene ends. A Solar may stock no more than (Dexterity + 3) attacks in this fashion through any combination of any Charms which stock free reflexive attacks, such as Shrike Saving Discretion (see Ink Monkeys, vol. 32).</description>

This Charm creates a peripheral Essence pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, the character may fill it by paying one mote and converting stocked attacks into offensive motes. The Solar is seen to strike across her center with fist or blade, severing as many attacks as she chooses from her gamut of potential actions. Each attack converted in this manner instantly becomes two offensive motes. The Solar may not use an offensive mote to power this Charm.</description>

      <description>During the Primordial War, members of the Dawn Caste became famous for throwing themselves into the hewer and refusing to bow. Never running away, never surrendering, inexorable; their unwavering valor even earned them the respect of the titans. If the Yozis learned little else from their defeat, they learned this: you cannot stop the rising sun. A character invokes this Charm in response to attack flurries or multiple reflexive attacks made against her during a single tick. This Charm may not aid a defense against single attacks, save for instant reflexive attacks (such as those created by Final Sunset Stance). However, against the first in a string of attacks, increase the character's Melee-derived Parry DV by one against that attack. If her parry succeeds, the entire string of attacks is instantly broken. If her defense fails, she may reactivate this Charm on the second attack, increasing her Parry DV by two against that attack. As before, if she successfully parries the strike, she defeats the entire attack; her opponent's attack is broken, her Essence dispersed by the Solar's definitive rebuff. The Solar may continue to activate this Charm, boosting her DV by a number equal to the number of current iterations in the attack string, until the attack ends or she successfully disrupts her foe's onslaught. Bonuses granted by this Charm do not count as dice added by a Charm and ignore maximum DV limitations. This Charm may not be assisted by Charms with a Flaw of Invulnerability; reverting to a perfect parry defense does not break the string of attacks and prevents the character's Parry DV from increasing on the next attack. Bonuses gained from this Charm diminish immediately as the attack ends.</description>

      <description>Turning inward, drawing down, the Cross-Fang Maelstrom is a phantom storm birthed in the heart of the righteous. The character must have at least three stocked free reflexive attacks in order to channel this attack against her target. The Solar expends up to (Dexterity + 3) free reflexive attacks upon activation, allowing the character to create a flurry consisting of an equal number of Melee attacks against a single opponent. All attacks in this flurry are made at the Solar's full dice pool, and the flurry has a total DV penalty equal to the highest penalty on any single attack in the flurry. Upon activation, the player decides how many attacks to launch against the target, but may unleash no fewer than three attacks. Treat each of the attacks as if they were the result of a coordinated attack effort (see Exalted, p. 144), with each attack lowering the target's DV by an equal number. This effect stacks with the successes from coordinating an attack, but only the Exalt's attacks benefit from the increased target DV reduction caused by this Charm. If the target flees the Solar's flurry through the use of Charms such as Leaping Dodge Method, the Solar regains a number of free reflexive attacks equal to the number of attacks remaining when the opponent moved out of range.</description>

      <description>The Solar controls the pace of battle and is exhilarated by her enemy's retreat. Whenever the character forces her opponent to use a movement-based evasion Charm such as Leaping Dodge Method (see Exalted, p. 227) to escape a close-range attack, the Exalt regains one point of Willpower. Characters may not gain more than one Willpower point per action through this Charm's effect.</description>

      <description>This Charm acts as a permanent upgrade to its prerequisite, allowing the Solar's player to count extra successes on the attack roll three times rather than twice for the purpose of determining raw damage. A second purchase, at Melee 6+, allows extra successes to be counted four times rather than three, while a third purchase at Melee 8+ allows extra successes to be counted five times. A fourth and final purchase at Melee 9+ causes each extra success to be counted ten times for the purpose of determining raw damage.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted embody a limitless destructive power which is second to none. Using this Charm, the character may tap into that power, focusing it into a large-scale defense capable of striking down and turning aside all oncoming forces with an even greater force of her own. Defending herself is not good enough; even if a star should fall, the Exalt may use Guarding Star Tactics to deflect it away from all that she wishes to protect by an unrivaled display of power. This Charm serves as a permanent upgrade to Heavenly Guardian Defense, allowing it to be activated with a four mote surcharge to serve as a perfect parry against any area-of-effect attack, environmental damage effect, or ranged attack from a complementary unit - a parry which destroys or turns aside the offending attack. Players should feel free to invent suitably dramatic stunts to express the way in which attacks are defeated.
   Attacks may be divided into two categories: transitory and sustained.
• Transitory: Transitory attacks are attacks composed of non-imperishable physical matter, energy, or non-permanent environmental hazards. Defending against a transitory attack destroys that effect utterly at the point where it intersects the Lawgiver's weapon, preventing it from harming anything behind the Solar, or any complementary unit he is a special character in.
   For example: The Exalt unleashes an arc of solar flame from his blade, burning away an arrow volley as it descends toward his army. Crackling waves of golden lightning erupt from the Solar's daiklave, shattering a swarm of obsidian butterflies in midair. The Solar's weapon strikes an incoming tidal wave, sending a sheet of Essence boiling across it surface and evaporating it before it can smash into Chiaroscuro. The Lawgiver's sword dissolves the leading edge of a Total Annihilation shockwave, unraveling the spell in moments. The Solar plunges his weapon into the ground, stilling an earthquake with a pulse of Essence.
• Sustained: Sustained attacks include attacks made of the five magical materials, attacks which are part of the body of a living being, permanent environmental hazards, and environmental hazards or attacks which the Storyteller deems unsuitable to arbitrary destruction. Attacks made with imperishable materials (such as a rain of jade arrows) are simply scattered and deflected without harm. Attacks made by permanent environmental hazards (such as the Pole of Fire) are stilled within (Essence) miles for (Essence) actions. Attacks made by living environmental hazards (such as the winds of Adorjan or a Lunar using a swarm Knack) are prevented from moving to intersect or bypass the position of Solar or any complementary unit he is a member of until their DV has refreshed. Attacks unsuitable for arbitrary destruction are generally one-of-a-kind storyline events, and are deflected or otherwise handled according to the Storyteller's discretion. Potential examples of resolution of such attacks:
   Golden lightning leaps from the Solar's blade to catch Mount Metagalapa before it can fall on her army, then shifts the mountain so that it is deposited safely on the ground several miles away. A shockwave erupts from the Solar's blade, knocking the flying manse away without harm moments before it would have crashed into Tzatli. A pillar of sunfire rises from the Lawgiver's blade, preventing two of Malfeas's layers from crashing together and sending them slowly drifting apart. A slash releases a cyclone which ironically carries Adorjan away.

      <description>The Solar whirls into a devastating attack, felling all who would stand against her with a storm of slashes. The character makes a standard Melee attack and applies it against all enemies within (Melee x 100) yards. Allies are immune to this onslaught; the waves of lethal radiance dance deftly past them. This attack is also applied against any enemy who moves into the effect radius during the Charm's duration, and applied again once per tick against any enemy attempting to move toward the Lawgiver. The attack produced by this Charm deals aggravated damage to creatures of darkness.
   If used over consecutive actions, the Charm loses its Willpower cost after the first use, and cumulatively lowers its most cost by two on each subsequent activation, to a minimum cost of 5m. The range of its area of destruction doubles with each consecutive activation. The Charm cannot spread to encompass more than the Solar's (Essence x 3) miles.
   Directed against a complementary unit in mass combat, this Charm renders the attack unblockable and undodgeable, and multiplies its final damage in Step 10 by the Lawgiver's Essence.

      <description>A brilliant red-gold corona erupts around the Lawgiver's weapon, empowering him to strike down his enemies. This Charm allows the character to enchant a weapon with Fire and Stones Strike for the duration of a scene rather than a single attack, at a cost of three motes per die added, following the same rules for maximum dice. This also counts toward the maximum number of dice that may be purchased with a subsequent normal activation of Fire and Stones Strike. Any nonmagical weapon forced to channel such power is destroyed when the Charm ends.
   At Essence 5+, dice purchased with this Charm no longer counts toward the maximum number of dice that may be purchased with a subsequent normal activation of Fire and Stones Strike.

      <description>The Solar's weapon surges with the limitless power of the wrathful sun god. An attack supplemented by this Charm adds (Essence) dice of raw damage in Step Seven. Should the dice of damage to be rolled after soak in Step Eight exceed the target's maximum total health levels, the Solar may instead inflict as many or as few automatic levels of damage as desired.
   At Essence 7+, this Charm may be used to inflict whatever level of damage the Lawgiver desires to nonmagical objects and structures up to the size of a palace. Cutting passes through hills or smashing down stout fortress gates are trivial exercises for such mighty heroes. At Melee 9+ the character may pay a five-mote surcharge upon activation to inflict as many or as few automatic levels of damage as desired to targets regardless of his total dice in Step Eight.
   A second purchase, at Melee 8+, Essence 8+, allows the Solar to activate this Charm as a miscellaneous action (Speed 5, DV -1), and commit Essence to it to "store" it in advance. When the commitment is reflexively dropped (this must be done in Step One), the Charm activates without counting as a Charm use. At Essence 9+, the Solar may store up to (Essence/2) activations simultaneously, though each must have Essence committed to it separately.

      <description>The Lawgiver's anima fractures into a thousand reflections of his weapon as he raises it in a silent salute. Afterwards, he moves with grace beyond words and skill beyond awareness to brush aside the clumsy attacks of any who should be so impudent as to strike at him.
   While this Charm is active, the character may invoke Heavenly Guardian Defense at its normal cost as an innate ability rather than a Charm activation. When used this way, the Charm's duration is always instant regardless of other modifiers. This benefit may not be be employed until the character's DV has refreshed once, and may be used a number of times equal to (Essence x 2); upon making the last permitted invocation, Immortal Blade Triumphant automatically deactivates itself. This Charm may not be reactivated to re-stock its supply of defenses while it is already active.

         <description>The Lawgiver channels the blinding radiance of his anima banner through his blade, empowering it as an icon of his martial legend and heroic triumph. While Immortal Blade Triumphant is active, the Solar's anima banner emanates from a chosen weapon, not from his person. At the lowest levels of anima flare, this channeling suffuses the enchanted blade with the light and colors of the Lawgiver's banner; at higher levels, the anima banner emanates from the enchanted blade itself, taking on the shape of the weapon it shines from. This Charm ends if the chosen weapon leaves the Lawgiver's hands, but his will alone is capable of breaking the bond. The weapon cannot be destroyed or disarmed, nor is it affected by magic that would break the Solar's attunement to it.
   As the vessel of the Solar's anima and personal legend, the enchanted weapon resonates with his heroic will, adding any dice from stunting or channeled Virtues to damage rolls as well as attack rolls. The overwhelming Essence pressure of the anima surrounding the weapon also magnifies the weapon's strength, both to lay waste to the Lawgiver's enemies and to shield him from harm. Any damage rolls made with the weapon convert up to (Essence) dice to automatic successes, and parrying with it adds (Essence) to the Solar's DV.
   Should the Solar have need of power beyond even this, then he may unleash the triumphant power of his martial legend in a single devastating attack. While his anima banner is flaring at the 16m+ level, he may choose to discharge this Charm through an attack. Doing so adds (Essence) automatic success to the damage roll instead of converting dice to successes, and allows the attack to bypass both soak and Hardness. Calling upon this power ends this Charm and resets the Solar's anima banner to the 0m level.

      <description>Spirits cannot hide from the Lawgivers. Spirits such as demons, ghosts and gods often move through the world in dematerialized form, completely hidden from all observers. This Charm lets the character see, hear, smell and feel - but not touch - dematerialized creatures. It makes dematerialized creatures within the normal range of the character's senses valid targets for the character's Awareness actions, including reflexive Awareness actions.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted may attack even the subtle Essence of dematerialized spirits. This Charm enhances an attack, making dematerialized creatures within the attack's normal range valid targets. The attack deals aggravated damage to spirits, materialized or otherwise. This Charm is explicitly permitted to supplement actions using other Abilities. Note that if the character cannot see the spirit he attacks, he receives the normal -2 external penalty.</description>

      <description>The heroes of the First Age used Ghost-Eating Technique to slay the Neverborn and the demon hordes. Spirits normally dissipate rather than dying when they lose all of their health levels to damage. The Solar invokes this Charm after making a successful attack that damages or dissipates a spirit. In addition to the normal damage from this attack, this Charm transfers a number of motes from the spirit to the Solar equal to (the Solar's permanent Essence x 2). If the spirit loses its last health level to this attack and dissipates, this Charm consumes the spirit utterly. Its Essence dissolves, and it will never be remade.</description>

         <errText>This Charm cannot drain more motes from a spirit than the total levels of damage dealt by the attack. Motes drained do not go into the Solar's Essence pool; rather, these torn-off fragments of spiritual power swirl invisibly about her, empowering her to continue her assault upon unruly spirits. For each mote drained by this Charm, the Solar may launch one Spirit-Cutting Attack at no mote cost. Phantasmal images of those spirits damaged or destroyed by Ghost-Eating Technique during the scene flicker and churn within the Solar's anima until she has used up all captured Essence on Spirit-Cutting Attacks, or until the end of the scene, at which point the drained power dissipates.</errText>

      <description>The Solar casts out spirits. She spreads her arms, and a blazing ring of gold-white light spreads from her, forming a circle centered on the character with a radius equal to (the character's Essence) yards. This circle remains centered on the character for the remainder of the scene. This Charm imposes a Compulsion effect on all dematerialized creatures who take actions in this scene. They are compelled not to enter the circle while dematerialized and not to stay within the circle while dematerialized. Resisting costs Willpower equal to the Lawgiver's Essence, after which the spirit can ignore the Spirit-Repelling Diagram for the remainder of the scene.</description>

      <description>Nothing is hidden from the Lawgivers. The character augments his vision with the ability to see patterns of Essence. This Charm allows the character to see motes, Essence-fueled effects, power and invisible but magical creatures and effects. These things become valid targets for the character's visual Awareness rolls, including reflexive visual Awareness rolls.
   The ability to perceive Essence patterns has the following effects: All Charms are treated as Obvious with respect to the character. Dematerialized and invisible creatures and effects are considered visible. The character recognizes all artifacts, manses and demesnes as such. The character can automatically recognize a creature with Essence 4+ as a supernatural creature. Characters using Stealth to avoid detection are not automatically revealed by their Charms, Essence trait or carried artifacts - for the same reason that colorful clothing does not automatically void mundane attempts at stealth. Instead, add the target's Essence in dice to any attempt by the character to pierce mundane or magical Stealth. Similarly, this Charm does not automatically void disguises, magical disguises and similar deceptions, although circumstances might warrant a bonus to see through them.
   If the character makes a conscious attempt to analyze what he sees, this Charm allows an (Intelligence + Occult) roll to do so. Identifying the exact effects of an unknown Charm or spell is difficulty 5. Gauging the rating of a person's Essence trait, a demesne, a manse or an artifact has difficulty 2.

      <description>The Lawgivers see all things truly. This Charm functions as All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight, but it has no cost - the character gains the benefits automatically whenever her anima banner is at or beyond the 4-7 mote level. If she wishes to use Essence sight at some other time, she may commit one mote reflexively to do so. While that mote remains committed, her Caste Mark burns visibly, and she has access to the benefits of All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight.</description>

      <description>Before Brigid discovered sorcery, the Solar Exalted had to counter the world-twisting powers of the Primordials through other means. Magic-Shattering Strike permits the Solar's attack to disrupt sorcery, necromancy, and Sorcerous-keyword Charms. The Lawgiver targets a spell or appropriate Charm and spends fifteen motes. The Charm or spell must be Obvious to the Lawgiver's senses to be a valid target for Magic-Shattering Strike. If the attack (which may use any combat Ability) successfully strikes the beneficiary of the spell, then the spell is broken as though targeted by the weakest level of countermagic capable of affecting it. If the spell creates or summons an automaton or spirit, the Lawgiver's attack must target that automaton or spirit. If the spell is a free-standing effect, such as Rain of Doom, then the attack must be generally aimed at the center of the spell's area of effect, and the effect is considered to have a Parry DV of (Circle x 3) for spells, or (Minimum Essence + 2) for Sorcerous Charms. Should the Solar successfully shatter a spell or Charm in this fashion, he gains (Spell's Circle x 4) or (Charm's Minimum Essence + 2) motes for doing so. Magic-Shattering Strike may explicitly be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.
   Lunar Exalted have a similar Charm called Sorcery-Rending Talons, which is identical to Magic-Shattering Strike with the following exceptions: Its minimums are Perception 5, Essence 4, its prerequisites are God-Cutting Essence and Instinctive Essence Prediction (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Lunars, p. 179), and it restores only (Spell's Circle x 3) or (Charm's Minimum Essence) motes on a successful application.

      <description>When the Solars graciously accepted the surrender of the vanquished Primordials, they gained authority over their numerous souls and mimetic races, including the power to summon and bind them into service. Sometimes waiting for Calibration - or even sundown - is an affront to the Lawgivers, as if to mock them for the mercies they once accorded. This Charm enhances the spells Demon of the First Circle and Demon of the Second Circle. At Essence 7+, this Charm's power expands to encompass Demons of the Third Circle as well. When casting one of these spells, the Solar may spend an extra 10 motes and one Willpower to gain the following benefits: The casting time of the spell is reduced to a single hour, and the dramatic action used to shape this spell may begin at any hour of the day and on any day of the year. The concentrated power of the Solar's will visibly strains the boundaries of existence, causing a localized Calibration more ominous and bizarre than the natural fixing of Creation that marks the beginning and end of each year. For an area of (100 yards for a First Circle demon, 500 for Second Circle demon, and one mile for a Third Circle demon) around her, sunlight bleeds away as surely as the coming of midnight, and sounds somewhere between great hollow wails of torment and the grating of brass echoes out from her location. The Bureau of Destiny is made explicitly aware every time this Charm is used to enhance a summoning, and knows where it was used.
   Whenever this Charm is used to summon a demon of the Third Circle outside of Calibration, the Solar must reflexively make a contested roll of his (Intelligence + Occult) against the Dodge MDV of each Third Circle demon he has currently bound. Failing this roll for a single demon permits all currently bound demons to slip free of their bindings.

      <description>It is the duty of the son to surpass his father. The Exalt may pay three motes and one point of Willpower whenever he activates a Charm with the Holy keyword. Doing so allows the Solar to treat the target of the Charm as if it were a creature of darkness. When using Eclipsing the Sun, the Lawgiver manipulates his instinctual understanding of Holy to supersede - if only for an instant - the will of Ignis Divine. Doing so against another Solar Exalted incurs the additional cost of one point of Limit, as the Exalt's will strains against the authority of the Most High.</description>

      <description>Veiling her nature in the essence of the eclipse, the Solar reaches through the cracks in the universe the Primordials forged to rip forth power hidden from lesser minds. This Charm allows the character to instantly learn one Charm per three motes committed to Power From Darkness. The only limit on this number is the amount of Essence the Lawgiver is willing to commit. These do not have to be Solar Charms, but they must be Charms a character of the Eclipse Caste could potentially learn through the Eclipse anima power. Power From Darkness is subject to the following limitations:
   The character must satisfy the trait minimums and prerequisites of all Charms bestowed by Power From Darkness. The character must have not only personally witnessed all bestowed Charms in use, but must have analyzed them with All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight. Power From Darkness may not bestow spells or Combos, nor may Charms acquired through Power From Darkness be placed into Combos. The Solar activates bestowed Charms as though they had been learned with the Eclipse anima power. Finally, Power From Darkness may only be activated during Calibration, though it may be sustained normally with committed Essence throughout the year.
   Whenever the character gains Limit while using Power From Darkness, she gains one extra point of Limit on top of whatever amount she would have normally accumulated. The Solar Exalted remain unaware of this flaw in the Charm.
   A second purchase of this Charm, at Occult 10, Essence 10, reduces its cost to 2m per Charm, 1wp and upgrades the character's Limit gain from +1 to +2.

      <description>This grim Charm was originally developed by ambitious Solars in the final years of the First Age. Frustrated by dead-ending in their study of necromancy at the Labyrinth Circle, they recklessly attempted to forge onward. Those researchers never did break through to the Void Circle. Instead, they found... something else.
   This Charm permits a Solar to learn and use Abyssal Charms as though she were an Eclipse Caste. Additionally, she may accept a point of Limit to activate the Abyssal Mirror of a Solar Charm she knows, with the same limitations as Unconquered Hero's Faith (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Abyssals, pp. 140-141). As a final side effect, she is guaranteed to linger as a ghost after death, rather than passing on into Lethe.
   The Charm's Avatar keyword indicates that the character must possess the Whispers Background at a rating of at least one dot to learn this Charm. Black Mirror Revelation may be learned only through meditation within the depths of the Labyrinth. In the First Age, its only acceptable prerequisite was Labyrinth Circle Necromancy. In the Second Age, perhaps due to the actualization of the Abyssal Exalted, Solars find it easier to let the whispers of the Neverborn guide them to a core of dark power nestled within themselves, and may also use Occult Essence Flow as an alternate prerequisite.
   This Charm may never be learned by non-Solar Exalted under any circumstances. As a point of clarification, its Abyssal Mirror, Unconquered Hero's Faith, may never be learned or used by any character who possesses Immortal Malevolence Enslavement. Furthermore, Deathlords are incapable of learning Unconquered Hero's Faith or any other Charm based upon fundamental elements of Abyssal Exaltation.

      <description>This bizarre Charm was innovated in the High First Age by the Solar Queen K'tula. After warping her body into a cephalopod horror through sorcerous manipulation, she found that she could not innovate new Solar Charms that acknowledged the terrible, inhuman capabilities of her new form. Pressing at the outer boundaries of sorcerous understanding, however, she was able to discern a set of cosmological principles more amenable to the thing she had become: the acrid Essence-flows of Kimbery.
   Upon learning this Charm, the character names a single Yozi. She can henceforth learn and use that Yozi's Charms as though she were a member of the Eclipse Caste, save that she needs no tutor. Primordial Principle Emulation may be purchased a total number of times equal to (Essence - 5), with each purchase covering a different Yozi. The character gains a point of Limit the first time she invokes any Yozi Charm within the scope of a scene. The Yozis are aware of this Charm, having used certain of its principles to help guide the formation of their Green Sun Princes. It has historically pleased them to dispatch their Solar akuma to suppress knowledge of the Charm. The Ebon Dragon especially enjoys the bitter regret of his gilded slaves when they realize they bartered away their souls needlessly.
   Thanks to the taint of the Great Curse upon their Exaltation, Solars may use this Charm only to unlock the secrets of the mutilated lords of Malfeas. It is possible that a Solar who was somehow cleansed of the Great Curse could also unlock the principles of non-Yozi Primordials. Thankfully, the Abyssal Exalted and their Deathlord masters have never discovered a Charm building off Void Circle Necromancy to gain access to the magics of the slumbering Neverborn. The most well-informed gods of the Division of Secrets hope such a thing proves impossible.
   This Charm may never be learned by non-Solar Exalted under any circumstances.

      <description>Others listen when the Lawgivers speak. In ancient days, they commanded the attention of Primordials, beasts and gods. This Charm involves a performance or oration, and the Solar's player rolls (an appropriate Social Attribute + Performance) when invoking Respect Commanding Attitude. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on everyone who can see or hear the character. If the extra successes exceed a given target's MDV, that target suffers a compulsion to stay in the Exalt's company and respectfully observe the performance. Resisting this compulsion for five minutes costs one Willpower, up to a maximum of three Willpower per scene, and such resistance allows the target to leave, heckle or even forcibly silence the character.</description>

      <description>Essence enhances the Solar's arts. This Charm allows the Solar to create ghostly images, Essence flares, ethereal music and strange sensory effects when using a Performance Excellency or Presence Excellency. These effects do not seem entirely real, they remain within (Essence x 10) yards of the Solar, and they cannot be used to confuse or deceive others without a stunt. This Charm has no cost, but the Solar need not use its effects.</description>

      <description>The Lawgivers define others' reality. This Charm is a Performance-based social attack that encourages a specific belief - for example, overwriting the audience's memories and convincing them that the Solar has always lived in their town. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on every valid target of this roll. If their MDV is less than the extra successes on the roll, this Charm inspires them to believe. It also creates an instant commitment (see p. 201) to that belief. Shaking off the illusion requires one Willpower per scene, and the effect lasts until the targets break their commitment to the false belief.</description>

      <description>In answer to the call of the Solar Exalted, in ancient times, people gave up their homes and families and marched to war. Some Lawgivers gave speeches and shone with the sun's radiance, but others called their servants with beauty - piping, dancing or playing at the harp, wordlessly and terribly calling their soldiers to their deaths.
   The Solar gives a performance, her player rolling ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Performance) and adding her Appearance in bonus dice. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on all who witness it. Characters with Mental DV less than the Solar's successes must spend two Willpower or fall instantly in love either with the Solar or something the Solar represents. This effect does not depend on gender or sexual preference. Targets incapable of sexual attraction to the Solar suffer starry-eyed infatuation or dedication to the Solar's cause rather than romantic desire. This love is a form of commitment (see p. 201). Targets can break the commitment naturally but they must spend one Willpower in each scene where they deliberately attempt to shake it off.

      <description>The charismatic soul of the Lawgiver bleeds into every song she sings, every word she reads, every act she plays and every step she takes, making her beautiful. Even if she's just singing softly to herself, she inspires adulation. Whenever she successfully influences a target with a social attack, that target acquires a positive Intimacy toward her, with an emotional context of the target's player's choosing, so long as the target does not choose to reject the social attack by paying Willpower or invoking an appropriate Charm. If the target already has an existing positive Intimacy toward the Solar, then he instead suffers an Illusion effect which causes him to regard the Lawgiver as having twice her true Appearance rating. This unnatural mental influence persists so long as the positive Intimacy does, but may be ignored for one scene by paying a point of Willpower, or broken altogether by paying five points of Willpower at once.</description>

      <description>The Unconquered Sun trusts his Chosen to separate out the righteous from the wicked. By the power he has invested in them, the Lawgivers may send forth the specter of his rage to be visited upon the enemies of the Exalted. This Charm allows entire groups to be labeled enemies of Creation and given the creature of darkness deformity. The Lawgiver's player makes a prayer roll against a difficulty of (3 + Magnitude of group targeted). If successful, the day dims and the air quivers, or the night grows hot and feverish and bright. Targeted beings realize what is about to happen as the wrath of Heaven gathers (the Charm is Obvious to them), and have one long tick to prepare themselves -Essence-users are advised to establish some form of Shaping defense. After one long tick passes, a surge of Essence rips through the area, flaring it bright as noon and rendering every targeted being a creature of darkness.
   This Charm may only be used to target relatively geographically compact groups, up to about the size of a city. Targeting may be based on geography or political affiliation. "Every member of the Guild in Nexus" would be a valid target for the Charm, as would "every man woman and child in Nexus" or "the army encamped in that valley". However, Guild members not in Nexus would not be affected, and if the army's general were back in the Lap receiving new orders, he would be spared, as he is not with the targeted bulk of the group. Likewise, "all members of the Guild" or "all Brides of Ahlat" would not be valid targets, because those organizations are spread far and wide geographically. The Solar must be close enough to the targeted group for at least one targeted individual to hear the prayers and condemnations he speaks to the Unconquered Sun.

      <description>Creation was given into the hands of the Lawgivers; it is theirs to govern and to judge, forever. Through the power of this Charm, a Solar may exile those who have proven themselves unworthy to exist in the world he rules. The Lawgiver's player makes a prayer roll against a difficulty of (5 + Magnitude of group targeted); this works in the same fashion as Catching the Sun's Glance, save that the Charm cannot discriminate to target sub-groups within a geographic region; for example, it can only target "everyone in Nexus", not "all Guildsmen in Nexus". Unlike its prerequisite, the Charm does not render its targets creatures of darkness. If used while the sun is out, the day grows dark as night as the Unconquered Sun turns his face away from what is to come. If used by night, the light of the stars becomes weird and green, casting everything into a febrile haze. Creation's Essence sizzles and screams at the culmination of the Lawgiver's ritual condemnation; the boundaries of the cursed area blacken, char, and erupt into flights of blind doves. A patina of silver sand drips from the stars. These omens persist for one long tick following the successful conclusion of the Lawgiver's prayer, which must be uttered within earshot of at least one targeted individual.
   At the end of that long tick, the entire targeted region and all inhabitants who have not fled or established Shaping defenses are torn from Creation in a surge of crimson Essence. Where the targeted region stood, there is only a plain of black glass holding Ligier's sullen reflection. He speaks a grudging word of ritual thanks for the Solar's offering, and then vanishes.
   The targeted region is deposited somewhere within a random layer of the Demon City, which reflexively re-organizes its geography to make room for the new arrival. The lethal miasma of Malfeas avoids such imported bits of Creation, but this is the only mercy the new deportees are granted; demons are always quite interested in the novelty of a freshly-arrived army encampment or city, and soon come to investigate.
   The Sidereal Exalted have repeatedly pressed for legislation to outlaw the use of this Charm, or at least require Deliberative-authorized advance warning of its deployment, as it wreaks untold havoc on the Loom of Fate whenever it is used. To date, these efforts have met with little success.

      <description>A favorite of many hedonistic (or simply predatory) Solars in the First Age, this Charm figures prominently in Immaculate legends of the Anathema. While the Charm is in effect, all characters who possess any sort of romantic Intimacy toward the Solar (love or lust, it makes no difference) have their MDVs set to 0 against seduction attempts by her. Shaking off this unnatural mental influence in order to assert MDV normally costs one Willpower per action.
   The embedded Intimacy of a Solar's Lunar mate always qualifies for this Charm, even if the Lunar chooses to articulate the bond as platonic friendship.

   While the Charm is in effect, all characters who possess any sort of positive Intimacy toward the Solar have their MDVs set to 0 against seduction attempts by her so long as she is of a gender they are normally attracted to; if she is not, then such targets halve their MDVs instead.
   The user's Lunar mate has his MDV set to 0 regardless of normal preferences.

      <description>By the authority of the Unconquered Sun, his Chosen may command the very heavens to become a vessel for their glory. This Charm may be activated only under the open sky, during the day. The clouds above shuffle themselves into the precise likeness of the Lawgiver, lit by the sun so that they glow from within. The Solar's words boom out over the countryside, inescapable.
   For the duration of the Charm, any Performance-based social attacks (or simple informative declarations) made by the Solar are transmitted to everyone within (Essence x 20) miles in every direction. Because the Solar cannot see or hear through his heavenly manifestation, social counterattacks that require the target to actually be present may not be invoked in response to this Charm.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Performance 7+, Essence 7+ expands its range to (Essence x 50) miles. A third and final purchase at Performance 9+, Essence 9+ expands the range to (Essence x 100) miles.

      <description>It is hard for mortals to resist the shining glory of the Solar Exalted. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence to create a Compulsion effect. The Lawgiver's player rolls (Manipulation + Presence). If the result exceeds the target's Mental DV, the target receives a compulsion to follow one order given by the Solar. The order can be as complicated as the Solar desires. The target must spend one Willpower to resist the order but need pay this cost only once per day. The influence fades when the Charm expires.
   When the Solar uses Hypnotic Tongue Technique, the target is not aware of the compulsion, nor does the Solar need to spell out the order explicitly in words. If the target wishes to recognize the influence or remember it later, doing so costs four Willpower, which must be spent all at once, and the target is thenceforth fully aware of the effect. Recognizing or remembering the influence is not considered "resisting" it, and the target does not gain Limit from doing so.

      <description>The Solar burns with the incandescent radiance of the Unconquered Sun. This Charm intimidates others, negating any physical or social attack made against the Solar unless the attacker's player succeeds on a reflexive resistance roll. The Solar's player chooses when purchasing this Charm whether a difficulty 1 Valor roll or a difficulty 2 Willpower roll is the appropriate form of resistance. The attacker need succeed only once per action, no matter how many attacks she makes during a flurry. This Charm's effects are a form of unnatural mental influence, and characters can spend three Willpower to resist the effects of Majestic Radiant Presence for a scene.</description>

For the rest of the scene, each character who interacts personally with the Exalt and has a lower MDV than the Exalt's Presence suffers an unnatural Illusion effect. He believes that the Exalt is someone with authority over him. Recognizing this belief as an illusion costs two Willpower. This Charm, as a specific exception to the usual rules for unnatural effects, does not cost Limit to resist.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted surround themselves with the faithful. This Charm is a Presence-based social attack that inspires someone to recognize the Solar's greatness. The target chosen must be a valid target for persuasion attempts. The Solar's player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Presence), subtracting the target's MDV from the successes as an external penalty. If the Solar succeeds, this Charm exerts unnatural mental influence and creates a Servitude effect. It compels the target to serve the Solar loyally. This effect costs one Willpower per day to resist.
   This Charm creates an instant commitment (see p. 201) to the Solar. The target cannot begin breaking faith (see p. 201) with that commitment until the Charm's effects end. The mental influence lasts until the target has fully shaken off this loyalty.

      <description>The Solar ignites her spirit with the Essence of the successes Sun. This Charm can enhance a physical attack. This Charm makes the attack Holy and causes the attack to inflict aggravated damage against creatures of darkness (see p. 192).
   This Charm can also enhance social attacks that create guilt, shame or fear, or where the Exalt uses a stunt to draw on these emotions. It makes the attack Holy. This Charm makes creatures of darkness treat the social attack as unnatural mental influence that costs one Willpower to resist. This Charm also halves the creature's base MDVs against the attack.
   This Charm is specifically permitted to enhance rolls based on other Abilities.

      <description>Locked in debate, the Solar's words fall so sweetly upon the ears of listeners that those of her opponent become harsh and discordant in comparison; such tonal inflections render the content of the conversation irrelevant. While this Charm is active, third-party observers to any debate the Solar engages in believe the Lawgiver to have decisively won the argument, regardless of the merit of her words (or lack thereof). Where possible, this is achieved by subtle introduction of bias. The observer glosses over the Solar's flaws and strictly judges his opponent's words and delivery. Against more rational opponents or those using objective criteria, Listener-Swaying Argument induces outright hallucinations - whatever is necessary for the witness to believe in the Solar's victory.
   The unnatural mental influence imposed by Listener-Swaying Argument affects all observers with a Dodge MDV lower than the Solar's ([higher of Charisma or Appearance] + Essence), and costs 2wp to resist at the time of activation. Characters can also correct memories clouded by this Charm, but only with external prompting to remember the debate or a personally compelling reason approved by the Storyteller. The victim must pay three Willpower to fix each scene of damaged memory.

      <description>The Lawgiver issues a powerful admonition against a target, forbidding him from taking a certain action. The Solar's player makes a (Charisma + Presence) social attack against the target's Dodge MDV; if successful, he may forbid the target from performing an act of his choice for the duration of the scene. This ban may be no wider than the scope of a single Ability or Charm, at the Storyteller's discretion. Examples of forbidden actions include "dodging my attacks", "attacking me with your daiklave", "picking any locks", or "using Seven Shadow Evasion". The Lawgiver cannot prevent the target from resisting Mind-Blanking Rebuke, or forbid any necessary life function ("do not breathe" is not a valid ban).
   This unnatural mental influence may be resisted for one action by spending a point of Willpower, and the target becomes immune to the Charm's effects for the rest of the scene once he has spent 3 Willpower resisting it.

      <description>A touch, a kind word, a moment of intimacy - Through such gestures the Solar Exalted may straighten that which is bent and mend that which is broken. This Charm's activation requires at least one hour of personal interaction, which may take a wide variety of forms. Patiently listening to a subject while they explain what ails them, sitting together to watch the sun rise or set, or an evening of lovemaking would all qualify. This Charm has two effects. First, the Solar may target and remove one derangement from the target's mind, regardless of whether it was inflicted by Charms, sorcery, the Wyld, or the simple stresses of life (if any effect contests this, the Solar adds his Presence in automatic successes to the roll-off). Second, the Solar forges in the target an Intimacy to a specific memory in the target's life of which she is aware. So long as this Intimacy endures, the target may not reacquire the derangement the Solar cured, nor may that memory be in any way tampered with, altered, poisoned, removed, or corrupted.
   Hastening Night's End may be resisted for a cost of 0 Willpower - the Charm will only help those who wish to be helped. It is impossible for the patient to gain Limit or Resonance, or suffer a Dark Fate manifestation, Limit Break, or Torment during the course of the treatment.
   There exists a similar Charm utilizing Medicine as a prerequisite called Mind-Soothing Anodyne (Prerequisites: Flawless Diagnosis Technique, Touch of Blissful Release). Its activation requires an hour of careful psychoanalysis or hypnotherapy, but is otherwise identical to Hastening Night's End.

      <description>All characters in existence who possess a positive Intimacy toward the Lawgiver find that they cannot intentionally raise a hand against her while this Charm is active. This unnatural mental influence forces such characters who wish to deliberately take some action they believe will bring harm to the Solar (be it physical, emotional, political or even financial) to spend one Willpower per action to do so. Spending three Willpower in this fashion within the course of a single scene negates the effects of Eternal Empress of Love Attitude for the rest of the scene, but the only way for a target to permanently escape the effect of the Charm is to remove her positive Intimacy for the Solar. A second purchase of this Charm at Presence 7+, Essence 7+ renders mortals incapable of spending Willpower to resist the Charm.</description>

      <description>This Charm is the result of Solar paranoia in the High First Age. When alone with one another, certain Solars referred to it by an alternate title, "Lunar-Taming Leash".
   With a touch, the Lawgiver infuses his Essence into the link constructed into his Lunar mate's Exaltation, vastly strengthening it. The Lunar gains the benefits (and drawbacks) of a five-dot rating in the Solar Bond Background. This unnatural mental influence remains in effect until five Willpower is spent at one time to remove it.
   In the event that a Solar's Lunar mate is not available, he may touch himself and activate the Charm instead. Doing so grants the Solar an infallible sense of the direction in which his mate can be found, even if he has never met the Lunar in question before. If the Lunar is in another realm of existence, the Charm leads the Lawgiver to the nearest point of entry to that realm.

      <description>The authority of a Lawgiver with this Charm is inescapable. The Solar is capable of making social attacks against her Lunar mate while he is under the effects of this Charm's prerequisite, enhanced by any desired Presence or Performance Charms, regardless of the distance separating them. This communication is one-way. The Solar cannot sense her mate's state of mind or read his thoughts. Though the Solar's player always dictates use of this Charm, characters sometimes use Soul-Spanning Bridge Method unconsciously, imposing their idle thoughts and desires on their mate unintentionally.
   Despite numerous attempts throughout the First Age, no Lunar has ever been able to design Charms permitting him to exercise power over his Solar mate through their spiritual bond.

      <description>This Charm permanently upgrades its prerequisite. The Solar no longer needs to commit Essence to sustain Underling Promoting Touch when applying it to un-Exalted humans or to Dragon Kings.
   At Essence 6+ the Solar may enjoy this benefit when applying Underling Promoting Touch to other Exalted, but doing so automatically creates an Intimacy of loyalty in the recipient. Exalted targets may reject the benefits of the Charm and the Intimacy at no cost, if desired.

      <description>As the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, the Solar Exalted are empowered on behalf of their patron to determine Creation's true enemies, even if they walk in the guise of the righteous. This Charm may enhance a Presence-based social attack to condemn, castigate or otherwise revile a subject as an enemy of Creation, making that social attack undodgeable. The target may not ignore the Solar's righteous tirade, but only attempt to counter-argue his own case against the Lawgiver's judgment. If the attack succeeds, the target has a one-time opportunity to spend two Willpower to resist (or one Willpower if the target is Exalted). Failure to do so bestows upon the target the creature of darkness mutation. The day dims slightly as he is permanently marked as an enemy of Creation.</description>

Success enables the Solar to achieve the desired effect instantly. With Essence 4+, a mortal's Motivation may be "attacked" in order to confer a new and more heroic Motivation (chosen by the mortal's player). Mortals are explicitly not forced to resist this effect. Success also transforms an extra into a heroic mortal.</description>

      <description>When the Solar armors himself for battle, there is no delay or fumbling - Essence smoothes his course. This Charm allows the Exalt to make one minute's progress on donning armor in a single action. The Solar Exalted normally use this Charm for a number of successive actions equal to the armor's mobility penalty in order to complete the armor-donning process. For example, six actions and six invocations allows an Exalt to gird himself in chain swathing. Facing exigent circumstances such as limited Essence or frequent interruptions, he could also spend two minutes' effort and four invocations of the Charm.
   This Charm applies to personal worn items, including body armor, shields, clothing and warstriders.

This Charm does not speed the amount of time it takes to fully attune to the warstrider, however, so as a practical matter, it is rarely useful to a warstrider pilot.</errText>

      <description>Armor worn in countless battles becomes a part of the Solar's spirit. It is always on hand when its master calls. The Solar first dons a suit of armor that she owns and has worn in battle. This Charm banishes that armor to Elsewhere. The Solar can gird herself in that armor directly from Elsewhere. Doing so takes as much time as donning the armor normally would, and she can use Whirlwind Armor-Donning Prana to speed the process. The Charm ends when she does so. If she cancels the Essence committed to this Charm while the armor is fully or partially Elsewhere, any donned pieces return Elsewhere, and then, the entire suit appears within arm's reach.
   This Charm applies to body armor and shields, but not other worn items.

      <description>The Solar armors herself in the blazing glory of the Unconquered Sun. This Charm creates a suit of golden body armor from the Solar's anima. The character can design the armor to suit his personal aesthetic and mood - it can be sleek, imposing, ornate or simple. Regardless of aesthetic, it is always unmistakably medium or heavy armor, and it always glows with a golden light resembling an 8-10 mote Solar anima display. This light is bright enough to read by in a three-yard radius.
   Characters can only use this Charm if they are not already wearing body armor or a warstrider. It creates armor with 10L/10B soak, 5 Hardness, a -1 mobility penalty and no fatigue penalty. The character is instantly fully armored. For an additional three motes, if the character is not carrying a shield, he can create a glowing shield that gives a +1 cover DV bonus against hand-to-hand attacks and a +3 cover DV bonus against ranged attacks. This shield is always unmistakably a shield and bears the sunburst emblem of the Unconquered Sun.

         <description>The Solar armors himself in the blazing glory of the Unconquered Sun. Glowing golden armor manifests on his body as he activates this Charm, taking on a form chosen by the Solar at the time he purchases the Charm. Statistically, the armor has traits equivalent to those of any basic orichalcum artifact armor with a rating of 3 dots or lower. One-dot armors cost 1m, 1wp to invoke with this Charm; two-dot armors cost 3m, 1wp; three-dot armors cost 5m, 1wp.
   Regardless of their design or statistics, the armors created by this Charm shine with golden light equivalent to an 8-10m anima display. Creatures of darkness are staggered by this radiance, subtracting the Solar's (Essence) from the raw damage of their attacks against him, to a minimum of one.
   For a two-mote surcharge, this armor may be invoked along with an Essence-forged shield decorated with either the symbol of the Unconquered Sun or a depiction of the character's iconic anima. This shield has the traits of a mundane shield of the character's choice, again chosen at the time of Charm purchase.
   Players wishing to have multiple options may take this Charm up to (Resistance) times, defining a different suit of armor each time they purchase it. Each purchase after the first costs 2 experience points.

      <description>In these grim and degenerate times, the Chosen of the Sun must be as soldiers ready for a battle. They cannot relax in the face of their enemies, and must sometimes wear armor for days at a time. Yet, they do not weary. For each three motes spent, this Charm reduces both the fatigue value and the mobility penalty of the Solar's armor by one, to a minimum of 0. A fatigue value of 0 means that the Solar's player need never roll to see whether her character becomes fatigued from wearing the armor. This Charm lasts until the character removes the armor in question.
   This Charm applies to any combination of worn items that give a mobility or fatigue penalty. This includes body armor, shields, combinations of body armor and shields, warstriders and articles of clothing that impose mobility or fatigue.

      <description>Mortal weapons are as the stings of wasps and hornets to the Lawgivers reborn. The Solar invokes this Charm after an attack hits him but before damage is rolled. Roll (his Stamina + Resistance) against a difficulty equal to the attacker's Essence (up to a maximum of 6). On a success, this Charm prevents all damage from the attack; on a failure, this Charm still gives him +4A/+8L/+8B soak.</description>

         <description>The Lawgivers are armored in righteousness; many need no other hauberk. This Charm upgrades Durability of Oak Meditation. The Solar may pay a surcharge of four motes to increase the soak bonus of the Charm to (Essence + Stamina + Resistance) and extend its duration to one scene. He cannot do so if he is wearing armor; donning armor later immediately ends any upgraded activations of Durability of Oak Meditation.</description>

      <description>Driven by her purpose and her Virtues, the Exalt becomes invincible. The Solar invokes this Charm immediately before the damage of a physical attack or similar effect is rolled. This Charm is a perfect defense against the raw damage of the attack, reducing it to zero after all other effects. This Charm has one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability (see p. 194).</description>

      <description>The more terrible the enemies and adversities they face, the greater the power of a Solar's spirit. The Solar invokes this Charm when hit by an attack with the potential to damage her - that is, an attack with a calculated raw damage exceeding her Hardness, which therefore rolls at least one die of damage. The Solar's player rolls two dice for each damage die rolled. For each success on this roll, to a maximum of her Stamina in successes, the Lawgiver receives a number of motes of Essence equal to her permanent Essence score. For example, an Essence 2 Solar with Stamina 3 would receive two motes with one success, four motes with two successes and six motes with three or more successes. This Charm cannot increase the Solar's Essence pool past its normal maximum, and the Solar can never gain more than 20 motes from any combination of Charms including Essence-Gathering Temper during a single one of her actions.</description>

         <description>The more terrible the enemies and adversities they face, the greater the power of a Solar's spirit. This Charm grants the character an additional ten-mote peripheral Essence pool in accordance with the Overdrive Keyword. Whenever the Lawgiver is injured, she gains motes which are used to refill this pool: one mote for being struck by an attack without taking damage, two motes per point of bashing damage, or three motes per point of lethal or aggravated damage suffered.
   Essence-Gathering Temper will only provide motes when the Solar is injured against her will; she may no more order a bound demon to assault her in order to obtain motes than she may gain them from stabbing herself. Health lost in order to pay the activation cost of a Charm likewise never produces motes.
   At Essence 3+ the Solar may also refill her Overdrive pool when she perceives her allies being injured, at the same rate as though she were taking damage herself. In order to gain motes in this fashion, the Solar must directly perceive the character being injured at the moment the injury occurs, and must have a positive Intimacy toward that individual (the character's Lunar mate also always qualifies). Finally, the injuries may not be self-inflicted, as outlined above, and may not be inflicted by the Solar herself.

         <comment>On Essence-Gathering Temper: "Due to uncertainty about when the Scroll of Errata will be updated next, this forms a particular exception to the policy of not doing errata on Ink Monkeys. As you can see, Essence-Gathering Temper is a whole new Charm. EGT is one of the most important Charms I ever designed. I came up with the concept for it in the wake of Dreams of the First Age, after designing the Ruin-Abasing Shrug + Rising Sun Renewal + Inner Fire Unleashed build. I knew that Essence-Gathering Temper would need a nerf, and early suggestions from trusted sources strongly urged me to limit EGT to a single mote kickback in the form of a Permanent Charm. Knowing the history of EGT and its importance to players, such a huge regression just did not feel right to me, so I began to look for alternate ways to make Essence-Gathering Temper shine. I wanted to avoid the defensive mote slog, encourage offense, and increase the use of Supplemental attack Charms, and these imperatives all seemed to fall right in line with the thematic of getting really pissed off when someone hits you. As a particular bonus, I also decided that a Solar should feel this empowering rage when he sees someone he cares for come under attack. Thus the mechanic of temporary offensive motes was born. From it sprang the Overdrive Keyword and a number of great new Charms." -Ø</comment>

      <description>The Lawgiver draws inner strength from the challenges that face him. He invokes this Charm when hit by an attack that damaged him - that is, an attack that cost him at least one health level of damage. His player rolls one die for each health level lost. This Charm restores one point of temporary Willpower plus one point for each success rolled. This Charm cannot raise the Exalt's Willpower above its normal value.</description>

      <description>The character steels herself for the struggle ahead. She awakens in her soul a deep and terrible passion - stoic dedication, primal rage, merciless justice or some other emotion appropriate to her nature - and lets it drive her into battle.
   This Charm gives the character an extra die to all combat-related pools and reduces all wound penalties by one. The character must be engaged in combat or attempting to become so engaged. She can attack at range and differentiate friend from foe, but she cannot utter sentences of more than a few words, move away from the enemy or perform complex actions such as retrieving a small object from a pack. To end this Charm prematurely, her player must spend one Willpower.

      <description>When ordinary means have failed, and there is nothing left save life and death, then it befits the god-kings of legend to give themselves over to the battle-trance and make themselves implacable enemies to their foes. This Charm functions as Battle Fury Focus but is in all ways greater. It gives the character three extra dice to all combat-related pools and removes all wound penalties. The character's mind is consumed by the battle-trance. The character cannot speak coherently and cannot retreat. She may only take one or more of the following actions: moving toward her current target by the shortest route, attacking enemies within range, waiting for an attacker to engage her or selecting the nearest enemy as a new target when her previous target is incapacitated, dead or not locatable.
   This Charm lasts until the character can no longer locate an enemy to kill. Enemies include known enemies and those who get in her way. Strangers and acquaintances can earn the enemy label if they are dressed like the enemy or if they act in a suspicious fashion. The character will not attack close friends, relatives or lovers for suspicious action or clothing - they must actively interfere to become targets of attack.
   To end this Charm prematurely, the Solar must spend three Willpower and gain one Limit. Reduce this to one Willpower and no Limit if a loved one or friend attempts to restrain the character. Unfortunately, if the Exalt does not spend the Willpower when a loved one attempts to break her battle-trance, she is almost certain to lash out at the unrecognizable blur distracting her from slaying her target.

      <description>Not easily are the Lawgivers slain. This Charm stops poison and sickness from doing further damage to the character for one scene. This Charm also prevents the character from suffering new Poison or Sickness effects during this scene. Effects that would poison or sicken him have no effect whatsoever. The character can walk hand-in-hand with plague victims, sprinkle poison on his food and eat ichneumon eggs as caviar. There are never ill effects later from these indiscretions.</description>

      <description>Even wounded nigh unto death, a Lawgiver will marshal the strength to rise again. This Charm supplements a dramatic action to marshal the character's inner resources for recovery. This action requires one hour without a stunt or another Charm. The Solar's player rolls (Stamina + Resistance). Success speeds his healing rate by a factor of 10 or, if the character prefers, adds directly to the successes of a physician using Wound-Mending Care Technique on the character. See page 149 for more on natural healing rates.
   Characters can activate Body-Mending Meditation when inactive (see p. 143).

This Charm creates an interaction between all Charms possessing the keywords Overdrive and Reactor. A character who has Surging Essence Reactor as well as Overdrive and Reactor Charms gains the following benefits: whenever the character generates more than twenty motes by use of a Reactor effect, the overflow motes go instantly into the character's Overdrive mote pool; additionally, if the Solar's regular mote pools are full upon using a Reactor effect, overflow motes go into her Overdrive mote pool.</description>

         <description>Like the sun they emulate, the Solar Exalted draw unlimited power by their very existence. Surging Essence Reactor upgrades all Overdrive Charms the Solar possesses. Whenever he would gain offensive motes from one of them, he may choose to instead convert them into attunement motes. These special motes are not added to the Solar's Essence pools, but can be committed to any unattuned artifact he has on his person, allowing him to reflexively attune to it if its cost is paid in full with attunement motes. Alternatively, he can commit attunement motes to an attuned artifact he possesses, replacing the motes he has committed to it from his own pools. At the end of the scene, all attunement motes are lost. The Solar may reflexively replace them with his own motes to sustain the attunement of artifacts empowered by them.</description>

      <description>Sealed for fifteen centuries in a cage of jade, the Lawgiver reborn has known death and darkness. Never again shall she yield. The player of a character with this Charm may pay one Willpower to roll (Valor) dice, healing a number of health levels equal to the successes on the roll.
   Moreover, the resilience of the Solar Exalted is only equaled by their courage; a Lawgiver using this Charm reverses even the most grievous of wounds, canceling them out by denying their existence through force of will. Characters who wish to substitute another Virtue for the purposes of this Charm may do so if dramatically appropriate. This Charm may not be used to heal damage from self-inflicted wounds, including damage incurred as part of the activation cost of a Charm. A character may not use Soul Fire Resurgence more than once per action. This Charm's Virtue roll may not be enhanced by other Charms or magic; Virtues enhanced by Epic Zeal of (Virtue) are never applicable for this Charm's effects.

      <description>Perfection is the nature of the Solar Exalted, and the best efforts of the world cannot draw them away from that state for long. The Solar's Essence surges and begins to catalyze, producing a crackling, charged feeling in the air around her, as though a storm were about to commence. Once her DV has refreshed five times, she erupts into a torrent of blue-white Essence, shining like a newborn star. When this surge of power passes, the Solar stands unmarred - all her health restored. Activating a Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability at any point during the Charm's 221charging' period resets its countdown. For example, if a Solar used Rising Sun Re-newal, had her DV refresh three times, and then activated Heavenly Guardian Defense, she would need to wait until her DV refreshed five more times before her health levels would be restored. Losing more health levels than the Lawgiver's Stamina during the course of a single action delays the countdown by one DV refresh.
   At Resistance 6+, Essence 6+, this Charm will also remove all Crippling effects in addition to healing the character.

      <description>The Solar's defense must hold at all costs. If the Solar falls, so does all that she holds dear. From this grim resolution a Solar draws the power to survive all onslaught. The character may use this Charm in response to an attack that incurs pre-soak damage. Upon activation, his hardness to rises to a level equal to the pre soak damage of the attack. This does not prevent damage dice from being rolled, but rather guarantees that all lesser attacks are turned harmlessly aside. The Solar's hardness remains at this level for three actions, or until he is struck by an attack that overcomes her hardness. Should the Solar suffer such an attack, he may reflexively pay six motes to drive his hardness up to match the attack's raw damage. This does not count as a Charm activation. This renewed defense will last for three actions or until it is dispelled by a greater attack, whichever comes first. This Charm is ineffective against attacks the Solar permitted to be inflicted upon himself.</description>

      <description>Considerate of others, a Solar may choose not to flaunt his invincibility until the very last instant. This Charm is a perfect defense, having one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability (see Exalted, p. 194). Upon activation, reduce the final damage inflicted by an attack to zero. Those crippled by iniquity are not availed of perfection. Characters with two or more points of Limit experience a failure in this defense: final damage is reduced to a number equal to the Solar's (Limit / 2, round down), as a crack in the Solar's aegis allows damage to slip through. Under this condition, Ruin-Abasing Shrug loses its Flaw of Invulnerability. Ruin-Abasing Shrug may not be used in a Combo with any Charm carrying the Reactor Keyword if it carries a Flaw of Invulnerability. A repurchase at Essence 7 allows the Lawgiver to extend this Charm's duration to One Tick by paying seven motes upon activation, or to One Action by paying seven motes, one Willpower.</description>

      <description>Essence permeates every fiber of the Solar's being. Lawgivers with this Charm have learned to focus that Essence upon their vital centers, imbuing their very cells with limitless energy. Whenever a Solar with this Charm heals damaged health levels, she recovers two motes per level. After twenty motes have been restored in this fashion in the course of a scene, the Solar only gains one mote per health level healed. When twenty more motes have been paid out in this manner within the same scene, the Solar only gains one mote per two health levels restored. This healing may only occur as a result of rest or of Solar Charms which heal damage. Though this Charm is permanent, it is perpetuated and substantiated by regular meditation upon inner forces turning outward. It is a sacred power which relies upon the Lawgiver's utmost care for her own well-being. This power fails the Solar if she inflicts harm upon herself or allows others to harm her: injuries from attacks thrown without killing intent will not yield motes when healed.</description>

      <description>Until the day he dies, the Solar will not stop fighting. He will sell his final light dearly. This Charm grants an Overdrive pool with a capacity of ten motes. Initially empty, the pool gains motes each time the Solar's wound penalty increases. Add a number of offensive motes equal to twice the wound penalty's value to the Solar's Overdrive pool. In addition, if the Solar has a wound penalty of -2, reduce the cost of all offensive Charms paid through Overdrive by one mote. This may reduce the activation cost of a Charm to zero motes, but the Solar may only enhance a single attack per tick with Charms costing zero motes. He may continue to benefit from the price reduction across additional attacks on a single tick, but consecutive attacks may not drop the cost of Charms below one mote. If the Solar's wound penalty is -4 or higher, reduce the cost of offensive Charms paid through Overdrive by three motes. At -4 or higher, the Solar may enhance two attacks per tick with Charms costing zero motes to activate.</description>
      <comment>On Red Dawn Ascending: "This Charm represents the relentless spirit of the Lawgivers, which seems even more alive and vital when they are closest to dying. All things in Exalted may be slain, but death holds no further dispensation over the Solar Exalted. Though it is not mirrored, compare this Charm to its design counterpart, Sunlight Bleeding Away, later in the post. Yes, it is an Abyssal Overdrive." -Ø</comment>

      <description>The Lawgiver can apply the lessons of Hauberk-Lightening Gesture to a warstrider, albeit at a significant Essence cost. The Solar first dons and attunes a warstrider as normal. He then commits an additional five motes and expends one temporary Willpower to banish the warstrider to Elsewhere. As long as the Exalt keeps the Essence committed, he can summon the warstrider back at any time by spending an additional five motes. The warstrider instantly reappears, with the pilot in the fuselage already fully plugged into the interface and attuned to the warstrider. If the Solar ever breaks the Essence commitment, the warstrider will instantly reappear in the nearest space big enough to hold it, and the pilot's attunement to the warstrider will be instantly broken. This Charm cannot be used to summon a warstrider if the pilot is in a place too small for the artifact to fit. Also, any items worn or carried by the pilot when he summons the warstrider may, at the Storytellers discretion, be lost forever in Elsewhere. This Charm is often comboed with Hauberk-Lightening Gesture and similar Charms that can banish weapons and armor to Elsewhere so that the Solar can freely switch between warstrider combat and conventional hand-to-hand combat (assuming, of course, that the Solar has prodigious quantities of Essence at his disposal).</description>

      <description>The Chosen of the Sun know their animals well. This Charm permanently enhances the Exalt's capabilities with one of the following tricks:
   Harmony of Spirits Style. The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to stop himself from falling off a mount. Characters can activate this effect when the character is inactive (see p. 143). In addition, as a permanent benefit, the character will not fall off the mount simply from being inactive during ordinary travel.
   Horse-Summoning Whistle. The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively to call a mount loyal to him to his side. The mount makes its way to him as circumstances best allow.
   Master Horseman's Eye. The Solar can spend one mote reflexively when evaluating a mount and perfectly recognize its strengths and weaknesses.
   Speed-Sustaining Technique. The Lawgiver can spend one mote reflexively and touch a mount to sustain it for two hours. Effort during that time does not exhaust the creature, and it does not suffer harmful random incidents such as thrown shoes or injured hooves.
   Spirit-Steadying Assurances. The Solar can spend three motes reflexively to prevent a mount from panicking. The mount will not panic for the remainder of the scene.
   Characters with this Charm can purchase additional tricks from this list for two experience points or one bonus point. using these abilities does not count as a Charm invocation - this Charm permanently enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

      <description>The Solar heroes are as one with their mounts. This Charm lets a character use his reflexive Charms to assist a loyal animal he is riding rather than himself. This counts as the character using that Charm, but adds one mote to its invocation cost. Because this counts as the character using the Charm, it must abide by all of the normal limitations on Charm invocation. For example, the character can't use a Martial Arts Excellency to enhance an attack and also use Reflex Sidestep Technique to help his mount dodge in the same action without a Combo. However, he could use either of these to help both himself and the horse in a single action. If the character has a self-invoking Charm, such as Surprise Anticipation Method, then it invokes to protect his mount as well. If the mount faces unexpected mortal danger, the character reflexively spends two motes to enhance the mount's Awareness and allow it to shy.</description>

For example, the character can use Thunderbolt Attack Pranato enhance his horse's attack, possibly even in the same action that the character uses it to enhance his own. The character cannot do so when these Supplemental Charms are part of a Combo that includes a Simple Charm.</description>

      <description>In ancient times, Solars chasing sundown represented something both tragic and awe-inspiring; their efforts redoubled at the fading of the day as a nod to their patron, his symbolic death leaving them to fill the void. This Charm captures a Lawgiver's breathtaking iconicity and his otherworldly there-and-gone nature, turning it into a renewed intent to bring the story to its conclusion.
   When this Charm takes effect, the Solar's player chooses a Virtue and rolls the Lawgiver's Conviction. The Exalt regains one spent channel for the chosen Virtue and Willpower points equal to (number of successes + 1). To gain this benefit, the Solar must leave a Magnitude 3+ social unit that he has helped in the past day, and must do so by making a dramatic exit on his mount, blazing his unforgettable image into their minds as he departs. Examples of a dramatic exit include riding off into the sunset, pausing to cut an iconic figure on the horizon, rearing one's steed so it can churn the air before galloping away, or departing at the height of a raging thunderstorm.
   This help must be intrinsically heroic and known to all members of the social unit, the sort of deeds that draw Solar Essences to Exalt mortals. Examples include driving off a ruthless band of brigands, killing a monster, curing a plague, feeding the hungry in a time of famine, improving the local infrastructure, healing the lame, etc. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of what constitutes acceptable help. Barring something unusually awe-inspiring, such help must have taken at least one full scene to provide.
   If the Solar ends a story with such a departure, he loses a point of Limit, and all members of the community gain a positive Intimacy toward the Solar with an emotional context defined by the Lawgiver (generally respect, love, gratitude or reverence). Resisting this unnatural Emotion effect costs (Solar's Essence, max 5) Willpower. Similarly, the unit's leader must spend (Solar's Essence, max 5) Loyalty or the Intimacy becomes part of the unit's Policy. For example, if the Solar saves a small town from hobgoblins and chooses an Intimacy of gratitude, all citizens feel thankful to him and incorporate that appreciation into their local culture. As a result, the people as a whole won't betray the Solar when the Wyld Hunt comes looking and only the most determinedly ungrateful individuals can bring themselves to such heinous treachery.

      <description>The Solars reinvent that which defines their legends. A character who purchases this Charm gains the following benefits: Ride Charms no longer count as Charm activations, and Ride Charms may be activated to enhance a mount the Solar is not presently riding, so long as he can perceive that animal or it is within one mile. In addition to these advantages, the Solar gains an auxiliary peripheral mote pool containing (Essence + Ride + 5) motes. The Solar may only use this pool to pay for Charms of the Ride ability. When this pool runs out, the character may then use her personal and peripheral mote pools to pay for Ride Charm activations. This mote pool refills by normal means, including stunts. A repurchase of Immortal Rider's Advantages at Essence 4+ doubles this mote pool. Another purchase at Essence 5+ doubles it once more.
   This Charm only applies under the following conditions:
• The mount must be a living being (i.e. not a Windblade or other accouterment which incidentally use the Ride ability).
         �� The mount must belong to the Solar (see Exalted, p. 238) or be the character's Familiar. Exalts, gods, and other powerful NPCs never qualify.
• Phantom Steed is expressly permitted to benefit from Immortal Rider's Advantages.

      <description>If a mount is only as good as its rider, a Lawgiver's mount defies all convention. By activating this Charm and paying three motes, for the next action the character's mount's capacity for movement-based stunts is increased a hundredfold. It may skid along the ground without losing speed, maintaining velocity without moving its legs, allowing it to drift, draft, and grind. It may spin, turn, twist, whirl, and even skate backwards at full speed. While taking these skid actions, the Solar's mount may not be directly targeted by any attack.</description>

      <description>When a hero rides away, he may be headed toward battle. Formation lines break and the wicked scatter at the Solar's terrifying battle charge. A Solar may use this Charm when emerging from a position of cover, such as smashing in through a window or leaping down from an overland pass; the Charm may also always enhance a mounted Join Battle roll. The Solar's player makes a (Charisma + Ride) roll, opposed by his opponents' MDVs. Each opponent whose MDV fails to protect her is awestruck by the Lawgiver's emergence onto the battlefield, and suffers a -3 internal penalty to all attacks directed at the Solar or her mount, and a -1 internal penalty to all attacks against the Solar's allies. This unnatural mental influence costs (6 – target's Valor) points of Willpower to resist, producing immunity to any further uses by the same Solar for the rest of the scene.
   Used in mass combat, this Charm may enhance a charge by the Lawgiver, causing it to count as a rout condition. Only the Solar need be mounted for this Charm to be activated, but if she is leading a cavalry charge by a mounted complementary unit, then the rout check is made at +1 difficulty. One Man Cavalry may not be activated more than once per action in this fashion.

      <description>Sometimes riding down a foe is just not good enough. Points are best when made soundly. The Solar may pay five motes and one Willpower to concentrate all the incredible speed of his mount into a single instance of acceleration. For the space of a heartbeat, the Solar 'draws back the reins,' holding his mount in place as a surge of withheld speed gathers in its legs like a storm, briefly drawing the world around horse and rider into the vacuum so created. When the Lawgiver lets go, all that force is unleashed in one tremendous shockwave that tears loose from the point of launch, ripping away at the ground with a sonic boom that inflicts automatic knockdown on all individuals within (Solar's Essence x 5) yards, while the mount is propelled forward (Essence x 10) yards in an instant. Creatures of darkness may not rise from prone until their DV has refreshed twice. This Charm may not be used more than once per action. For a point of reference, this Charm simply causes a sonic boom in the air, while in loose dirt or mud it may cause the added abuse of showering foes with muck; used over water, such as at dockside, it creates a small tsunami to achieve this effect.</description>

      <description>The mounts of the Solar Exalted are as tenacious as their riders. The Lawgiver may use this Charm to lock on to a target no more than (Essence x 3) yards away. Doing so causes an invisible tether of force to bind his mount into an orbit around the target. Carried on the momentum of the target's movements, the Solar's mount may effortlessly keep pace with the target, moving freely to any point within (Essence x 3) yards in order to maintain the minimum distance required for this Charm. The Lawgiver's mount becomes tireless so long as Draft Horse Measure is in effect, and all Ride Charm costs are lowered by 2 motes (to a minimum of zero motes). This Charm does not confer the ability to fly or to run across water, so other Charms are required in order to ride the Silent Winds of Adorjan across Malfeas or chase Leviathan across the ocean.
   At Ride 6+, Essence 6+ the Solar may tether himself to weather patterns, enabling him to draft behind a hurricane or trade wind.

      <description>In the Time of Glory the Solars used this Charm to pull down the sky and drop mountains on the heads of the Primordials. In the Era of Dreams, a Solar once saved a caravan stranded in the desert after a Fair Folk attack by using Sun-Towing Method to haul their entire wagon train to Chiaroscuro with a single horse. Essence imbues the Lawgiver's mount with incredible strength to pull massive loads, also rendering any means used to attach the load (such as a rope tied off to a mount's saddle) unbreakable. The Solar's mount may pull any object with no loss of speed, regardless of the object's weight. This does not imbue the object with any unusual durability.
   At Ride 6+, Essence 6+ Sun-Towing Method may be used to drag any vehicle, regardless of its size - even those normally large enough to qualify as structures, such as ships.
   At Ride 7+, Essence 7+ the Solar may haul structures with a spherical mass up to up to (Essence x 50) yards in diameter. Should he tie off to a larger structure or landscape feature, his horse will tear out an appropriately-sized chunk and drag it away. For example, a Solar with Ride 10, Essence 10 could tear off the peak of a mountain and ride away with it at full gallop. Manses cannot be moved in this fashion.

      <description>The heroes of the dawn are masters of the sea. Invincible Admiral Method resembles Salty Dog Method but extends its benefits to others. This Charm assists in naval and shipboard operations. The Solar must be on board a seagoing vessel. This Charm removes one point of external penalties from appropriate combat, social, dramatic and military actions for all units within (Essence x 10) miles that are actively following the character's lead - including solo units. For example, this Charm benefits a Solar's crew during a boarding operation or the Solar's navy during a large-scale fleet battle.</description>

      <description>The Essence of a ship knows its master. This Charm claims a ship. The target ship must not be owned (see p. 238) by another Essence channeler. This Charm causes the Exalt to own the ship instantly. Other characters subtract one success as an external penalty from all actions while on board until the Exalt formally welcomes them to the ship and unless he later renounces them. This is enforced by the little god of the ship, so the Exalt must welcome and renounce others in the language of the Old Realm and in earshot of the ship itself.</description>

      <description>A man of the sea is a legendary thing to behold. A character who purchases this Charm gains the following benefits: Sail Charms no longer count as Charm activations, and Sail Charms may be activated to enhance a ship the Solar is not presently aboard, so long as he can perceive that vessel or it is within one mile. In addition to these advantages, the Lawgiver gains an auxiliary peripheral mote pool of ([Essence + Sail + 5] x 2) motes. The Solar may only use this pool to pay for Charms of the Sail ability. When this pool is depleted, the character may use his personal and peripheral mote pools to pay for Sail Charm activations. This mote pool refills by normal means, including stunts. A repurchase of Immortal Captain's Advantages at Essence 4+ doubles this mote pool; a repurchase at Essence 5+ doubles it again.
   This Charm only applies under the following conditions:
• The character must own the ship (see Exalted, p. 238).
• Characters who are admiral to a fleet of ships may apply this effect to various ships under their command, even ones they do not own.
• The character may apply Perfect Reckoning Technique to every ship he commands with a single activation.

      <description>The authority of the Lawgivers transcends boundaries. All nations are their nations; all people are their people. Standing at the center of a vessel she owns, the Solar releases her Essence into the ship, veiling it from hostile eyes and hostile intent. All observers who witness the ship see it as a friendly vessel, if possible - its sails display friendly colors, and its sailors seem to be of the proper origin and nationality. Pirates and other nautical predators instead see a ship that is too poor to bother assaulting, or too formidable to consider boarding. This unnatural mental influence costs four points of Willpower to see through. The disguise has one major flaw - the ship's reflection upon the waves shows its true nature. Solars are thus advised not to sail too close to other vessels when relying upon this Charm.</description>

      <description>The Solar's vessel shouts his legend into the world. This Charm may only be used aboard a ship the Solar owns. The identity of the vessel's owner becomes Obvious to all characters who perceive it. Should they be unaware of the Solar by reputation or personal association, Mariner's Parable Defense makes it clear - the Exalt is a legendary man of the sea: a hero who sinks pirates, rescues damsels in distress, puts storm gods in their place, braves hurricanes and defies the Yozis; or a peerless pirate who ransacks port towns, evades capture with a laugh, and steals comely lads or lasses with as much ease and abandon as casks of jade. Should the Solar's ship put into port while this Charm is in effect, this aura follows the character wherever he should go, up to (Essence) miles from the ship.
   Common folk marvel at the Solar's heroism or cringe before his rapacity-he raises his Appearance and MDVs by three with regard to all characters struck by this aura. Additionally, fear of the Solar's prowess imposes a -1 external penalty to all attacks directed at his person or his ship. This unnatural mental influence costs two Willpower to resist for a scene.
   Additionally, the Solar gains one temporary dot of Influence while this Charm is active.

The magic quickly sinks into the boards of the vessel, visible only by the lanyards which untie themselves, the sails which raise and lower in accordance to the Lawgiver's will, and the other processes by which the ship obediently tends to its own upkeep and operation. So long as this Charm remains in effect, the ship requires a crew of zero sailors. So long as the Solar remains within (Sail x 100) yards of the ship, she may direct its course as though she were onboard.</description>

      <description>The path of a Solar must not be impeded, nor the glory of his vessel diminished. While this Charm is in effect, any craft the Solar is aboard becomes immune to Shaping effects, and it and all passengers are immunized against the warping powers of the Wyld. Additionally, the ship will not burn, cannot be capsized by waves or impacts, and is immune to sorcery of the Terrestrial Circle and Sorcerous Charms of Essence 3 or below. The Solar may also declare one particular environmental hazard that the ship is immune to upon activating this Charm (for example, the acidic waters of Kimbery, or the razor-edged waves of a Wyld-tainted sea).
   Finally, this Charm's prerequisite is also permanently improved, changing its duration to one action.

      <description>The power of the Solar Exalted extends to all things which enable their legends. This truth is demonstrated clearly by this Charm, through which any ship the Solar commands becomes an extension of his anima. Upon first purchasing this Charm, the Solar's ship gains the effect corresponding to his caste. Additional powers may be purchased for two experience points each. The Solar's vessel may only benefit from one effect at a time.
• Dawn: For three motes, the Solar's ship becomes an extension of his terrifying might for the rest of the scene - the minds of his opponents are clouded with fear at the thought of the reprisals that would be invited by assaulting such a vessel. Opponents must pay two points of Willpower to ignore this unnatural Compulsion if they wish to target the ship with their attacks. This power in no way prevents the ship's crew from being targeted.
• Zenith: For three motes, the Solar's ship becomes Holy ground for the rest of the scene. Any creature of darkness boarding the vessel enters an environmental hazard with (Damage 2A/action), Trauma (Sail).
• Twilight: The ship becomes aware of all threats approaching within (Essence x 30) yards, from above, below, or beside the ship; this warning is communicated to the Solar in the form of eerie sea-sounds which appraise him of the position and bearing of the threat (for example, something below the ship and approaching fast). This benefit costs one mote, and lasts for one day.
• Night: For three motes, a mist rises up around the ship's shrouding it from view. This grants a +3 bonus to all Stealth attempts, and reduces the cost of Sea Ambush Technique by one point of Willpower.
• Eclipse: The Solar may pay five motes to cause his anima to surmount the ship as a flag bearing complex sigils which may be understood by all observers. This flag may offer the terms of a truce, alliance, or financial arrangement. It is clear that this offer is genuine, and magically binding; should the captain of another vessel verbally agree to the terms offered by this flag, that fact becomes Obvious to the Solar and he may pay one Willpower to sanctify the oath as though with the Eclipse anima power. Additionally, if the character is a member of the Eclipse caste, he may sanctify any oath spoken aboard his ship that he is aware of for a cost of only one point of Willpower.
   At Sail 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm gains the Stackable Keyword, and the Solar may simultaneously apply up to (Essence - 4) different effects at a time.

      <description>The Solar reshapes the beliefs of a society. This Charm is a Socialize-based social attack to make a social group with Magnitude 1+ (such as a court, kingdom or secret society) believe something. The character must have spent several hours within the last year encouraging the desired belief within this group before using this Charm, and this Charm must be invoked in the presence of at least one member of that group. The Exalt's player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Socialize). Subtract an external penalty equal to the group leader's MDV plus half of the group's Magnitude from the rolled successes. If the character succeeds, the social group accepts the belief.
   This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence. The targeted group - and any social groups of Magnitude 1+ that splinter off from the target - must spend six Loyalty to break free of the influence forever or one Loyalty to break free for a single scene.
   This Charm has no effect on individuals - only on groups. The character can redefine a church's dogma or change the prevailing beliefs of a nation, but any given individual reacts of his own accord. The primary function of Wise-Eyed Courtier Method outside of narrative time is to limit the actions that social groups can take.

This Charm is a Socialize-based social attack to make a group feel a strong emotion - to lose itself in hatred, grief, lust or the joy of festival. It functions exactly as Wise-Eyed Courtier Method, save that its unnatural mental influence imposes an Emotion effect rather than a belief.</description>

      <description>The Solar furiously condemns or supports some behavior, encouraging an entire society to accept or reject it. This Charm is a Socialize-based social attack to compel a social group with Magnitude 1+. The character must have spent several hours within the last month encouraging the desired attitude within this group before using this Charm, and this Charm must be invoked in the presence of at least one member of that group. The Exalt's player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Socialize). Subtract an external penalty equal to the leader's MDV plus half of the group's Magnitude from the rolled successes. If the character succeeds, the social group adopts a taboo or fad of the character's choice. The society instantly integrates the taboo or fad into its Policy. The taboo or fad remains part of the group's Policy until the group's leader spends a total of 10 Loyalty, at most one per week, to remove it. It is also a part of the Policy of any social groups of Magnitude 1+ that splinter off from the target group, and the leader of those groups must spend a total of 10 Loyalty, at most one per week, to remove it.
   This Charm has no effect on individuals, save that breaking the new rules of their society can make them outcasts. Its primary function outside of narrative time is to limit the actions that social groups can take.

      <description>The Solar convinces society at large to reject a given individual or group. The Solar must touch an individual target or interact with the targeted group. This Charm is an unnatural Socialize-based social attack to undermine the target's position. The Exalt's player rolls ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Socialize). Subtract an external penalty equal to the target's MDV plus half of the target's Magnitude from the rolled successes.
   If the character succeeds, the target puts his or its worst foot forward in every social situation. For the rest of the day, in every scene, the individual target or representatives of the group must spend one Willpower to act naturally. Otherwise, he or they subtract the character's Essence in dice as an internal penalty from all social dice pools.

      <description>The Lawgivers understand how people interact. This Charm is an attempt to survey the power relationships in a given social environment. The character builds an accurate profile of the people and relationships involved, which the Storyteller can detail as desired. The Exalt's player rolls ([Perception or Intelligence] + Socialize), adding a dice bonus equal to the Exalt's Essence. The difficulty of this roll is 1. If a major social group in the court is deliberately attempting to send out misleading cues, subtract an external penalty equal to the largest ([Manipulation + Socialize + Magnitude] / 2) for such a group from the successes rolled. Unusual circumstances, such as a major player not being present at all during the character's survey, can also impose an external penalty. If the character succeeds, then each success reduces external penalties on dramatic and social actions to manipulate social groups within that environment. This Charm cannot reduce external penalties by an amount greater than the Solar's Essence.
   The Exalt can have only one profile of a given social environment. The crispness of the profile - that quality that reduces external penalties - lasts only as long as the committed Essence. The Lawgiver's player cannot roll again to build a new profile unless the story ends or a new piece of evidence allows a dramatic reconceptualization of the court's structure.

      <description>The Solar attunes herself to the patterns of human interaction. This Charm makes her responses to social situations so natural and appropriate that in social combat she treats all enemy groups as one point of Magnitude smaller than they are (to a minimum of 0.) It also increases her effective Appearance by one dot. When in doubt, other characters will be more apt to do small favors and provide hospitality than not. Finally, this Charm ensures that the character understands the basic motivations of everyone present in the scene, as if her player had rolled three successes on a mundane Investigation roll to estimate each person's motives.</description>

      <description>Seasoned Princes of the Earth are no longer surprised by the schemes and treacheries of their subjects and peers. Their petty games are transparent before the Lawgiver's jaded eyes. While this Charm is active all social magic directed at the character becomes Obvious to his senses. At Socialize 7+, Essence 7+ this Charm's duration becomes Indefinite. At Socialize 9+, Essence 9+, its cost drops to 1m.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Socialize 6+, Essence 6+ adds a second benefit: While the Charm is active, any social Charm directed at a social unit the character is a member of or which includes loyalty to him as part of its Policy becomes Obvious to his senses, though the identity of the character attempting to influence his social group is not automatically made known to him. For example, if a young Solar attempts to use Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe on the capital of a prefecture the Solar rules, he becomes aware that someone is attempting to influence the people of the city with Taboo-Inflicting Diatribe, but would have to personally investigate to discover the identity of the offender.

All individuals with a Dodge MDV lower than half the Solar's (Charisma + Socialize + Essence) who behold the character and have no reason to regard him with hostility are inclined to respect him, gaining an automatic Intimacy of admiration toward the Lawgiver.

      <description>As a prelude to their war against the Primordials, the Exalted sought means by which they might defeat their world-shaking foes. While members of the Night Caste were content to lurk in the shadows and watch their intended prey engaged in various disgusting acts, one Eclipse felt that the closest secrets would require her to seduce them. Some say that, in return for guzzling copious quantities of infernal juices, she discovered that no Primordial could be slain until they were tricked into making it possible by killing one of their own.
   Although the sexual characteristics of a Primordial's shapes might vary from a thousand penises to vaginas of ravenous teeth, vortex-filled anuses or immaterial fantasies with breasts the size of a yeddim, this Charm lets an Exalt satiate the desires of one who attacks her intimately. Lesser beings - animals, men or gods - are hard pressed to resist that which seduced their betters. This Charm does not enable the Exalt to actually receive or survive the sexual act, although other Charms (such as Mountain Penis Absorption, p. 68) or ballsy stunts might do so. Suffering a sexual encounter from another being allows the Solar to launch this social counterattack, which can only be blocked or dodged by social defenses that allow the target to block or dodge perfect attacks. If this counterattack succeeds, the sex partner must spend two temporary Willpower points per dot of Compassion that the Solar possesses or be reduced to 0 MDV for the rest of the scene.
   This Charm may be used in mass social combat, although doing so requires the Solar to have sex with every member of the social unit. Success reduces the unit Loyalty instead of Willpower.

      <description>The Lawgivers must sometimes mask their glory, moving anonymously among the common folk. This Charm makes the character difficult to notice unless circumstances or battle readiness make him obvious. It causes Awareness and Investigation rolls made to notice the Solar to fail automatically unless the Solar is currently joined in battle (see p. 141) or the observer has a minimum two-die bonus from circumstances. Examples of relevant circumstances include the +1 bonus guards receive from alertness, the +1 bonus to notice a Northerner in a Southern city and the +3 bonus to notice a blood-drenched orichalcum-armored Solar at a formal dress party.</description>

      <description>The Mental Invisibility Technique bends the minds of those who might observe the character. The Exalt's player rolls ([Dexterity or Manipulation] + Stealth), adding her Essence in automatic successes. This Charm exerts unnatural mental influence on all those who observe her. If the character's successes exceed a target's Dodge MDV, the target is compelled to ignore the Solar's presence whenever the Solar is not joined in battle (see p. 141). The target must spend four Willpower to resist this compulsion, which drops to one Willpower if someone calls the target's attention to the Solar.</description>

      <description>In the night, surrounded by the brooding things of darkness, it is sometimes hard to remember the sun. This Charm allows the character to apply Stealth retroactively. The Solar's player rolls ([Wits or Manipulation] + Stealth), adding a number of automatic successes equal to the Exalt's Essence. This stealth veils the character in others' memories. The first time in each day that someone attempts to remember an event involving the character or attempts to recognize the character, that person's player must reflexively roll (Wits + Lore) and achieve more successes than did the Exalt's player. If he fails, the character does not remember or recognize the character - in his memories of past interactions with the character, the character is either a nameless, unremembered figure or simply not present at all.</description>

This Charm makes it impossible to detect the character with any sense save touch -unless they bump into him, observers simply cannot spot the character. This Charm fades instantly if the character joins battle or moves (with the Move action, the Dash action or their narrative and dramatic equivalents.) It fades automatically five ticks after someone notices the character by touch.</description>

      <description>The eyes of the Solar Exalted are always watching. Through the use of this Charm, the Solar becomes omnipres-ent in the minds of the wicked. The Solar touches a target (this may require a Dexterity + Martial arts attack if the target attempts to avoid contact) and spends four motes. The sensation of the Solar's touch lingers on and on, eventually spreading to encompass all of the target's senses. So long as these motes remain committed, the Lawgiver seems to be constantly shadowing his mark - the target frequently glimpses the Solar leaning in doorways, or disappearing down alleys. He sees the Exalt's silhouette watching him from rooftops or following him through crowds. The Solar seems to be watching more often than not, always vanishing if confronted directly. This is an unnatural Illusion effect which costs two Willpower to ignore for a scene; the effects of the Charm end once the target has spent a total of twenty Willpower fighting it. The Lawgiver adds his Essence in bonus successes to all attempts to establish or reestablish surprise against individuals afflicted by Everywhere and Nowhere Stance - it becomes difficult to discern the Solar's true presence from the shadows in the target's mind.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Stealth 6+, Essence 6+ permits the Solar to use this Charm on an area. Used in this manner, Everywhere and Nowhere Stance has a cost of 6m, 1wp. So long as the Solar commits Essence to the Charm, everyone in the affected region suffers visions of the Solar's presence, as detailed above, though with lower frequency - no more than once per scene. Individuals in the affected region may resist the Charm's Illusion for one Willpower per scene, but cannot permanently immunize themselves to it so long as they remain in the area. Everywhere and Nowhere Stance may initially be used upon an area a mile in diameter, but with Stealth 7+ the Solar may affect an area up to (Essence x 2) miles, and with Stealth 8+ may affect (Essence x 10) miles. At Stealth 9+ the Solar may spread her presence across (Essence x 100) miles, and with Stealth 10 the Lawgiver may encompass an entire Direction.
   At Stealth 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may add a point of permanent Willpower to the Charm's cost when used to target a region. Doing so changes the Charm's Duration to instant, requiring no Essence commitment on the part of the Lawgiver and rendering its effects permanent. The Solar's shadows will continue to haunt the area forever, even after his own demise.

      <description>Legend and fact soon become interchangeable in the lives of the Exalted, and the Solars embody this principle - to the degree that the Princes of the Earth sometimes find it necessary to hide even from themselves. This Charm allows the character to walk directly out of the ongoing narrative of his life, either dimming himself to the eyes of history, or increasing interest in his legend until he himself is all but forgotten.
   Should the Solar dim himself, he passes from the active thoughts of Creation. His personal acquaintances will still recognize him, but strangers will not. Even if the Solar stands directly next to a poster bearing his face and name, those without a personal relationship simply will not connect the two. The Lawgivers use this Charm to temporarily escape from the public eye. This unnatural mental influence costs four points of Willpower to resist, or only one if someone actively points out the Solar's identity.
   Alternately, the Solar may enhance his glory until its glare blinds the world. The Lawgiver once again cannot be recognized as himself - even by those who know him. The reality of the man simply does not connect to the stature of his legend. Used in this mode, the Charm requires only two points of Willpower to resist, but offers an additional benefit: No action the Solar takes will besmirch his reputation, as bystanders are overcome by memories of the Exalt's glory days rather than circulating news of his misbehavior. For example, Desus could beat an orphan to death in the middle of the street, and any onlookers who recognized him would go home to reminisce about the time he bravely taught the behemoth Oliphem the cost of defying the Solar Deliberative. This unnatural mental influence costs three points of Willpower to resist.

      <description>The Lawgivers were meant to work together to bring order to Creation, but the Night Caste has always found fulfilling this mandate difficult. This Charm helps the Iron Wolves stand side by side with their less subtle brethren. The Lawgiver need only touch a consenting ally and commit two motes to tag him as a beneficiary. Up to maximum of (Stealth rating) beneficiaries may be tagged simultaneously.
   Beneficiaries use the Solar's traits (if higher) for all rolls to remain undetected. Additionally, whenever the Solar activates another Stealth Charm or Stealth-related anima power while using Spreading Night's Shroud, she must pay two extra motes per beneficiary. This surcharge extends the effect through the tag, hiding the beneficiary just as it hides the Solar. Should the Lawgiver or any beneficiary do anything that qualifies as an attack, however, all the Lawgiver's shared effects instantly terminate, preventing an unexpected attack.

      <description>It is not enough to have a brief moment's anonymity. The wisest Lawgivers must sometimes abandon their thrones to walk among the people, unnoticed and unsuspected, in order to truly understand what ills must be overcome in forging a better world. A Solar using this Charm wraps himself in a cloak of perfect obfuscation as long as he adheres to the basic customs of the land in which he resides (dressing appropriately, speaking the local language, observing native rituals and so forth). Attempts to track and locate the Solar within the city or nation he moves through automatically fail. (If another Charm contests this effect, add [Essence] automatic successes to the Solar's roll). This Charm helps hide the Solar only from efforts to locate him within a large area or populace.
   It will not actually assist personal attempts at stealth, so a guard can plainly see a Solar attempting to walk into a restricted area (though as long as the Charm holds, the guard will recognize him only as "an intruder"). The Charm automatically deactivates itself and will not reactivate for the rest of the scene if the Solar joins battle or flares his anima banner above the one- to three-mote level of expenditure.
   In the case of beings who are also large areas containing a population, such as Autochthon or many Yozis, this Charm provides full protection from the being the Solar hides within, despite that Malfeas is technically always "present" in every street and building of the Demon City. Due to differences in scale of existence, the Solar is able to hide within his vastness the way a flea might hide in a human's hair.

      <description>Even the beasts and birds recognize the heroes of the dawn. This Charm keeps natural animals from attacking the character unless they are provoked or driven by unusual pain or fear. It allows the Exalt to communicate with natural animals - with sounds and gestures - as if they shared a common language. Animals have limited capacity for comprehension, and the Exalt cannot convince an animal to adopt a belief or plan that it cannot understand.
   Characters can activate Friendship with Animals Approachwhen inactive (see p. 143).

      <description>Since the First Age, the Lawgivers have forged magical bonds with their chosen beasts. The target of this Charm must be an animal loyal (see p. 175) to the Exalt. Normally, the Exalt wins this loyalty through persuasion and the use of the Friendship with Animals Approach. The Exalt can only use this Charm if he has no familiar, and using it on a new animal for the first time removes his Familiar Background entirely. This Charm is a dramatic action requiring several hours of interaction with the target. It increases the Exalt's Familiar Background by one dot, to a maximum of five. When the Exalt's Familiar Background reaches a sufficient level to have the animal as a Familiar, it becomes his familiar. For example, a tiger requires three applications of this Charm to become the Exalt's familiar, and two more to give the Exalt the abilities conveyed by Familiar 5.</description>

      <description>Animals trained by the Solar Exalted become more loyal and more powerful. This Charm involves training a natural animal or familiar. This Charm requires five or more hours of effort in any given week to bear fruit. This Charm replaces the normal effects of that training. In each week of training, the trainer picks one of the following to train:
• Strength, Dexterity, Stamina or Perception. This Charm increases the animal's Attribute by one dot, to a maximum of (its species average + 2).
• Valor. This Charm increases the animal's Valor by one dot, to a maximum of 4.
• Athletics, Awareness, Martial Arts, Resistance or Survival. This Charm increases the animal's Ability by one dot, to a maximum of the Solar's own rating in that Ability.
• Health and size. This Charm gives the animal an additional -1 health level and, optionally, increases its size by 10%. This Charm can give an animal a number of extra levels no greater than its Stamina.
• Intelligence. This Charm gives the animal the effective intelligence of a six-year-old human.
   Using this Charm on a familiar increases all of these maximums by one and allows training the animal to adult human intelligence.

      <description>The wilderness cannot subdue the heroes of the dawn. This Charm negates any environmental external penalties to Survival rolls made for the Solar. This means that the coldest glacier and the hottest desert are no more deadly for the Solar than the gentlest rolling plain. She can find food and water easily, she ignores inclement weather even when lightly dressed, and she does not suffer undue blisters, bug bites or plant poison even walking barefoot through the Far East. This Charm does not protect against environmental damage, however, so if the environment is deadly enough to force regular Resistance rolls, the Solar needs Element-Resisting Prana to endure it.</description>

She can survive in a bonfire, underwater, in a volcano's caldera or in a pool of boiling acid, all with ease. She takes damage or suffers Poison, Crippling or Sickness effects only when directly inflicted upon her by some character's action.</description>

         <errText>Environmental damage inflicted via Charms, spells, etc. are replicating natural environmental damage, but it isn't actually natural. These are supernatural assaults that are directly inflicted upon characters. So, for example, Dragon Vortex Attack would, in fact, be able to inflict damage to someone under the aegis of Element-Resisting Prana.</errText>

      <description>The land gives its strength to the Lawgivers. This Charm affects the character or a group she leads with a Magnitude no greater than her Essence. The character or group may forage in the wild and find enough food for a small meal each. It takes five applications of this Charm per day to keep a group well fed. If the Solar has dependents not foraging with her, food found with this Charm can be brought back to them. For example, for three motes, a 10-person group can find enough food to maintain two dependents for a day.</description>

      <description>The deepest wilds are no mystery to the Solar Exalted. This Charm affects the character herself or a group she leads with a Magnitude no greater than her Essence. While this Charm is in effect, the character or group travels 10 miles per day across the harshest terrain and 20 miles per day across normal wilderness. The Solar's player automatically succeeds at any valid Survival roll for the Exalt to find her way - though the character must have enough information to make this a valid roll.</description>

      <description>This Charm is a dramatic action to camouflage the Solar or some person or object, and it normally takes one hour to perform. The player rolls (Intelligence + Survival) to determine the quality of the camouflage. This Charm makes the camouflaged thing impossible to detect with Awareness rolls using ordinary senses. Characters with inhuman sensory acuity, such as Lawgivers using Keen Smell and Taste Technique, can discover the hidden thing by opposing the camouflage roll with (their Perception + Awareness). Characters conducting a thorough search, such as a miscellaneous Investigation action with a normal Speed of five long ticks, can oppose the camouflage roll with an appropriate dice pool.</description>

      <description>Guided by the light of the Solar Exalted, none shall lose their way. Flaring his anima to a towering iconic representation that surges a mile into the sky, the light of the Solar's Essence shines through all barriers and obstacles and may be seen up to (Essence x 10) miles away. All attempts to navigate toward the Solar automatically succeed - for both allies and enemies. Astrology used within this range returns only the message "THE LAWGIVER BECKONS".
   At Survival 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm may be activated for a cost of 10m to provide one of two alternate benefits. The Solar may act as a beacon only for those he wishes to attract without needing to flare his anima; alternately, the Solar may send his anima burning even higher into the sky, extending the range of its visibility and navigation benefits to (Essence x 100) miles.

      <description>The Solar Exalted may survive anywhere. By his mastery of Survival, he may guarantee this protection to his followers. Even in the depths of Hell or the tunnels of the Labyrinth, Solars using this Charm may erect a shelter which is stable and safe from forces which would seek to harm those within. Once she has found shelter large enough to protect all of her followers from the elements (an Intelligence + Survival roll with a difficulty of the Magnitude of the character's entourage), the Solar personally builds this shelter. She places representations the five elements at the center and directional boundaries of the shelter (these representations can be actual examples of each element, such as twigs, stone, cinders, etc, or the Solar may use a few drops of blood, paper effigies, Dragon-Blooded willing to sit still, or other tokens) during its construction, blessing the configuration with his power and claiming all within its borders as his dominion. For a larger group, the Solar supervises the process of building this shelter (an action normally requiring one hour), but otherwise using the same process as described above.
   This Charm protects an area large enough to house the Solar and up to her Essence in Magnitude of her followers. The inclement conditions of harsh weather hold no sway over the camp - all individuals within are protected as though with Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit. Moreover, the camp is immune to the inclement conditions of alien worlds. The Wyld will not mutate the camp's land, the Solar's followers, or their belongings, nor will Malfeas's toxic miasma poison them. The Solar and her followers may respire Essence normally even in the Underworld or the Blight Zones of Autochthonia.
   Moreover, the Solar's followers will take no harm from any nourishment scavenged within the confines of the camp. Wyld berries will not poison them, nor singing fish give them mutations. The iridescent locusts which swarm across the sands of Cecelyne will not infect them with demonic taint.
   Finally, the Solar's Food-Gathering Exercise may secure enough food to feed the entire camp with only a single use - even if there is no food to be had in the region. As if produced by faith alone, the Solar finds clean water flowing from the rocks of Malfeas, fresh fish in the acrid seas of Kimbery, and living fruit upon dead branches.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Survival 6+, Essence 6+ sanctifies the camp as Holy ground. Creatures of darkness must spend five points of Willpower to set foot within the camp unless formally invited by the Solar.

      <description>The unbound anima of the Solar Exalted subverts the wrath of nature, cowing the elements in order ensure the safety of the followers of the sun. When faced with the unmitigated purity of the sun's light, all lesser forces must bow. By voluntarily flaring her anima into an enormous pillar of light, the Solar banishes the wrathful elements. Lava flows part or harden to admit the passage of the Solar's followers. Flesh-scouring sandstorms whirl about and leave them untouched. The Solar may extend the effects of Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit to a unit he leads with a Magnitude of up to his Essence, so long as that Charm is active. They are also immunized against toxic atmospheres such as the miasma of Malfeas.</description>

      <description>Even in a pitched battle, the Lawgivers strike with controlled precision. This Charm enhances a Thrown-based attack so that it stuns or cripples the Solar's opponent. For each health level of damage this attack inflicts, this Charm subtracts one die (as a -1 internal penalty) from the target's Physical Attribute dice pools and one point from the equivalent static ratings. This is a Crippling effect that lasts for the remainder of the scene. The players and Storyteller decide how the effect is inflicted - it could be an injured hand, slashed tendons or a stunning blow to the head. Storytellers will have to work with the players to determine how the attack cripples more exotic opponents such as automata and the walking dead.</description>

      <description>The Solars' opponents are often arrogant and attempt to predict how and when the Lawgivers will strike. Such is their folly that they cannot see the vengeance of the Unconquered Sun even when it comes upon them. This Charm conceals a Thrown-based attack. Characters watching the Solar need (the Solar's Essence) successes on a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll to notice him making the attack. This success requirement decreases by one each additional time the Solar uses this Charm in a scene. For characters not watching the Solar, all evidence indicates that the attack comes from a direction and distance named by the Solar when making the attack. For example, a Solar attacking from behind might wound an enemy in the side or chest by having his missile curve at the last moment.</description>

      <description>This is a Charm of silent death that imbues the Solar'sweapon with Essence. It supplements a Thrown-based attack and supernaturally cripples its target. Targets affected by this Charm cannot speak or cry out. This Charm silences their every action. The bells they ring make no noise, and if they fall off of a wall, they will land silently. In short, their actions are not valid targets for hearing-based Awareness rolls. Should the attack kill the target, no one will notice the target's death until the Charm expires. The corpse usually remains standing, and a combination of circumstances, dramatic necessity and perfect timing and execution on the Solar's part keeps the target's companions from noticing the death.
   This Charm can impose silence for a number of the Solar's actions equal to her Essence score. The Chosen must pay three motes for each action of silence she wishes to buy. The initial attack counts as an action. The Charm expires at the end of the appropriate action.

      <description>Surprise is at the foundation of all military undertakings. The Sun's Chosen strike with secrecy and rapidity, confusing and confounding their enemies. Falling Icicle Strike enhances an unexpected attack (see pp. 155-156). Count damage successes for this attack twice. If the player rolls five damage dice and gets two successes, it will strip away four of the target's health levels.</description>

   If the Solar has Essence 4 or higher, this Charm also negates external penalties from environmental conditions.

This Charm supplements a Thrown-based attack, filling the air with dozens or hundreds of duplicates of the Lawgiver's thrown weapon. This Charm renders the target's Dodge DV inapplicable against this attack. It also doubles the Solar's successes on the attack roll before comparing it to defense, in Step 3 of attack resolution.</description>

      <description>The Solar cherishes his weapons. This Charm gives the character three bonus successes on any valid action that, if it succeeds, will physically reclaim one or more of the throwing weapons he owns - whether by yanking one back to him on a cord, snatching several up while running past, grabbing a knife from the lava's surface before it sinks or snatching a weapon physically from an enemy who has stolen it. This Charm does not affect attempts to reclaim throwing weapons by non-physical means such as persuasion, nor does it help when the character is taking preparatory actions such as running across a hair-thin bridge to where his weapon rests. Returning Weapon Concentration also makes any weapon slide free of any target without resistance, so that the lightest tug can reclaim even a knife sheathed to the hilt in a tree.</description>

      <description>The Exalt shapes weapons from shadows, Essence and light. This Charm permits a Lawgiver to create temporary throwing weapons. Each such weapon costs two motes of Essence to create. Each has the weapon qualities of a Thrown weapon costing at most Resources 2, such as an exceptional hatchet or throwing knife. These weapons last for one scene, but they thrive on the Essence of the Exalt who created them. If anyone else uses them to make an attack, these weapons fade away during Step 2 of the attack's resolution.</description>

      <description>A Solar may learn to master all angles, trajectories, and speeds of attack - even those of his enemy. This Charm takes effect when the Solar is targeted by an attack, telling him the exact range and position of the character that made the attack. This does not allow the Solar to see his opponent; instead, his superior throwing skills allow him to calculate the angle of attack, making a perfect estimation of his assailant's position. At Essence 3+, the Solar gains a taste for the Essence signature of his attacker; when faced with more than one opponent whom he cannot see, the Exalt may tell the difference between them, even if they are constantly changing positions. This does not confer information about the identity of his attackers; he simply knows them by their attacks, making it possible to hone in on a particular opponent under changing conditions.</description>

      <description>Even should his prey dive below the waves or tunnel underground, the Solar may track its progress. This Charm supplements a Thrown-based attack. If the attack inflicts damage, the projectile sticks in the victim, rendering the weapon inapplicable for any Charms which summon weaponry. So long as the Solar's weapon remains embedded in his victim, the Lawgiver feels its presence calling out to him, and may track the movements of his opponent up to (Essence x 100) yards. The Solar enjoys three automatic successes on all Awareness rolls to detect marked enemies within this range. The Lawgiver must own the weapon used to make this attack (see Exalted, p. 238), and it may not be an artifact (missile weapons form an exception; for example, a sling of deadly prowess may be used so long as the Solar is hurling mundane bullets) or part of the character's body. Any attempts to remove the weapon cause it to break off in the wound, destroying the weapon. This does not terminate the Charm's effects. Removing this fragment requires a (Dexterity + Medicine) roll at difficulty 4.</description>

      <description>When challenged, the breathtaking speed with which a Lawgiver calls blade to hand is often the last miracle her opponent witnesses. This Charm represents the unhesitating, blinding speed of a Solar's genius hands, honed by a lifetime of practice. Add one success to the character's Join Battle rolls. In addition to this benefit, the character may also reflexively draw or ready a Thrown weapon upon rolling Join Battle, without the need for a miscellaneous action. Finally, all Thrown attacks made during the first tick on which the character acts after rolling Join Battle have a Speed of three.</description>
      <comment>On Flashing Draw Mastery: "This may be the Charm that started it all. Before I ever came up with the Martial Keyword, I knew that I was going to need to fuse the combat abilities together to make them worthwhile. This was one of the first Charms conceptualized: a 'lightning draw' Charm in Thrown that would apply to all your different combat abilities. A character with Flashing Draw Mastery may use Thrown - the art of fast eyes and faster hands - to improve his weapon drawing techniques in other combat abilities, signifying the linked nature of combat abilities and the way in which buying up Charms in one combat ability teaches you martial techniques and martial logic which carries over to your other fighting techniques to create a kind of snowball effect, thereby making purchases in any Dawn Caste ability apply toward your total character concept. Because of this design - which is demonstrated in the rest of the Charms you see here, as well as throughout the errata - all of the Dawn abilities may be seen as important and valuable to making your character the ultimate combatant, in the way that other Castes' abilities all help to facilitate the standard character concepts of those particular Castes. This Charm also marked the beginning of my interest in making Join Battle an important and active part of your combat strategy, as evinced by several other Charms." -Ø</comment>
      <comment>On Flashing Draw Mastery: "Join Battle has always been a bit of a tricky issue in Second Edition. There are plenty of Charms out there to help you win it, but if you play the 'Join Battle Game' and lose, the penalty tends to be things like death via Kill Combo. A lot of players are willing to simply sit out Join Battle, accept whatever their base dice pool gives them, and keep their Charm selection free rather than taking a gamble they might lose. The Flashing Draw series ups the stakes on Join Battle, granting rewards for winning - and penalties for losing - that make opting out a dicey proposition. Dawns should play to win at combat, from the very beginning." -H</comment>

      <description>Sometimes outgunned, rarely outdrawn, a Lawgiver answers the call of battle with a swarm of deadly steel. This Charm permanently enhances the Lawgiver's ability to manage greater numbers of opponents. Upon rolling Join Battle for the first time in a scene, the character may make a reflexive Thrown attack against any opponent whose Join Battle result is less than her own. Additionally, where others would grow desperate at the sight of enemy reinforcements, the Lawgiver is invigorated. For the duration of combat, the character may make a Thrown attack against all opponents who roll Join Battle after the initial Join Battle roll that began the fight, unless that character is doing so because they have cast a spell (generally representing new characters appearing and entering the fray). This Charm will only allow the Solar to make attacks against opponents whose engagement range she is within.</description>

      <description>A Lawgiver may grow to become an old hand at killing. When greatly outnumbered, it may not do to break his cover at the first opportunity. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite. The Solar may opt to withhold free reflexive attacks accrued against opponents as outlined by the rules of Swarm-Culling Instinct, choosing instead to stock these attacks until a tactical opportunity presents itself. Free reflexive attacks stocked in this fashion vanish at the end of the scene. Until then, the Solar may unleash as many attacks as he has stocked on targets of his choice. For example, a character with five stocked attacks may choose to unleash five attacks on one target, or he may launch a single attack against five different targets, or he may attack one target three times and withdraw, retaining two free reflexive attacks until the scene ends. A Solar may stock up to (Dexterity + 3) attacks in this fashion.</description>
      <comment>"Thanks to this Charm, the fastest guy in a five man Wyld Hunt is going to be the first one to eat an eight hit zantetsuken when your Solar steps out from behind a tree after using Vanishing March Manuever. The War Charms listed above, and those written in Dreams of the First Age, were devised to help players conceptualize War as a vital part of a Dawn's combat array, but it is Charms like Shrike Saving Discretion which really drive the point - and your daiklave - home.

      <description>The enemies of the Solar Exalted soon learn to kiss the ground. Prudence suggests that they stay there. When an opponent attempts to rise from a prone position, the Solar may activate this Charm to reflexively make a standard Thrown attack against the target. This attack is automatically unexpected.</description>

      <description>The Solar is a living weapon, every mote of his Essence a microcosm of the perfect assassin. The character gains the following permanent benefits:
• Triple-Distance Attack Technique: The Charm extends the range of thrown weapons by a factor of ten rather than three. At Thrown 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm changes a weapon's range value from yards to miles.
• Spirit Weapons: This Charm's Cost becomes zero motes.
   Additionally, all unexpected Thrown attacks ignore the target's Hardness.

      <description>This Charm costs three motes every time its benefits are activated. It allows the character to hurl implements in order to take a normal action out to a range of (Essence x 10) yards; for example, the character could throw her lockpicks at a lock to make a Larceny roll, toss a pen at a desk to write a letter from across the room, or hurl her daiklave at an opponent on the other side of a moat to make a standard Melee attack. Acuity of the Far-Flung Hand does not help the character retrieve tossed items. Penalties that would apply to a Thrown roll (such as those due to wind or poor visibility) apply to the roll for the action taken.</description>

      <description>The Solar focuses the apocalyptic might of his Essence into a weapon and hurls it out into the world, where it becomes a vortex annihilation formed of ten thousand glittering blades. The character makes a single Thrown attack with a readied weapon. This attack is unblockable and undodgeable, and applies to every character within a line (Essence x 3) yards wide, (Essence x 2) yards high, and (Thrown) miles long. At Thrown 8+, Essence 8+ the Charm's distance extends to (Thrown x 3) miles.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Thrown 7+, Essence 7+ upgrades its destructive power to the point that the attack lacerates the very fabric of the cosmos. A million white-hot cuts sizzle in the air, leaving behind a ragged white scar of sunfire. This acts as an environmental attack within the area covered by the Charm's initial attack with Damage 3L/action (Damage 3A/action as a Holy effect against creatures of darkness), Trauma 3. This scar lingers for (Solar's Essence) hours. The Lawgiver is advised to be wary of this barrier, as he is not immune to its power.

      <description>The glory of the Solar Exalted steadies those who follow them. The Exalt can target up to her Essence in military units or (Essence x 100) scattered individuals with this Charm. The Exalt chooses the targets insofar as she cares to specify; otherwise, this Charm affects the closest non-enemy targets. Individual targets must be able to see or hear the Exalt. Targeted units must be able to see or hear some sort of Solar-sent signal. This Charm causes targets to succeed automatically on all Valor rolls. If used in the instant one or more targets fail a Valor roll, this Charm allows the targets that failed to reroll, but the reroll does not automatically succeed. This Charm's effects last until the Exalt's next combat or mass combat action.</description>

      <description>The Lawgiver's forces know his will. The Solar calls out an order or message. It is still conveyed by his voice, his signal or by relays, but the message is effectively instantaneous - his troops find themselves reacting almost as an extension of the Solar's desires. This Charm conveys a message up to 12 words in length to one or more loyal units within (Essence x 100) yards and guarantees that the message is clearly understood. This Charm has special effects when used immediately before a roll to determine whether a targeted unit hesitates or can change order rapidly. If the Exalt gives an appropriate order, the roll succeeds automatically.</description>

      <description>The Lawgiver chastises the unworthy rabble. This Charm forces the player of an enemy unit most of whose members are within (Essence x 100) yards to make an immediate check for rout. The difficulty of this roll is 1 if the unit has Magnitude greater than the Exalt's Essence, and 2 otherwise. This Charm can be used socially rather than in war, in which case the Exalt can treat any mob, gathering or social group he can reasonably chastise as the target military unit.</description>

This Charm organizes all characters whom the Exalt successfully persuades and who do not resist the persuasion (see p. 179) into an unordered military unit under the Exalt's direction. This unit dissolves if the Exalt abandons it for more than 15 long ticks.</description>

      <description>The Solar Exalted do not abandon their forces. This Charm informs the Lawgiver of the position and status of all units within (Essence x 10) miles containing a commander, hero, relay or sorcerer loyal to the Solar or to a cause for which the Solar is fighting. This includes solo units, but not solo extras. The character determines only the strategic position of each unit - where units are located relative to one another and to major landmarks such as mountains, cities and rivers. The status information that the Solar learns is the unit's fatigue, order and current Magnitude. The Solar acquires this information as an instinct but can convert it mentally into a battle map if appropriate for the character. The Storyteller is the final authority on whether a Solar without established loyalties is fighting for a given cause.
   This Charm gives the Lawgiver awareness of all the major landmarks within one mile of any loyal units.

   This Charm costs five motes when used in combat or social combat, or five motes, one Willpower when used in mass combat. It renders allies fearless within a range of (Essence x 20) yards, not (Essence x 5).
   At Essence 3+, in addition to the listed effects, whenever the Solar or an ally under the effects of Heroism-Encouraging Presence channels Valor to enhance an action, they add successes rather than dice to the action at a rate of one success for every die that would have been added. If the action succeeds, the character is automatically refunded the Willpower spent to channel Valor.

      <description>Under the banner of the Solar Exalted, even bandits and peasants become deadly warriors. This Charm involves training a military unit. This Charm requires five or more hours of effort in any given week to bear fruit. This Charm increases the Drill of a unit by one for each week of training, to a maximum of Drill 5. In each week of training, the trainer picks one trait to train: Valor, Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Archery, Dodge, Martial Arts or Melee. This Charm increases that trait for each member of the unit by one dot, to a maximum of 4. The Solar can train with the unit or as a solo unit, increasing her own traits. She cannot increase others' traits past her own.</description>

      <description>Solar Exalted imbue their warriors with something of theirown nature. This Charm enhances the Exalt's ability to trainwarriors. This Charm allows him to use Tiger Warrior Training Technique to train others in any of the following:
• Military Abilities he possesses at 4 or more. In additionto the Abilities already available through Tiger Warrior Training Technique, military Abilities include Thrown, War, Integrity, Resistance, Survival, relevant Craft, Medicine, Athletics, Awareness, Stealth, Ride and Sail.
• Willpower. The Exalt can train Willpower to a maximum of 7.
• Bonus dice. The Solar can devote one week's training torare and special techniques. This gives trained characters two bonusdice or one bonus success for a specific activity defined by the Solarduring training. This benefit must have military relevance, it doesnot apply to Exalted targets, and it is not cumulative. Charactersmust abandon their previous training and lose the previous bonusto benefit from this Charm again. This bonus can apply to rolls forany Ability and is considered an artificial two-die specialty thatstacks with (at most) one die of other specialties. Examples includea one-success bonus in silent communication, a two-die bonus infighting when outnumbered and a two-die bonus for nocturnalfighting. Non-extras must pay four bonus points or eight experiencepoints for this benefit, and they go into experience debt as usual if they cannot pay. The Storyteller is the final authority on whethera special technique has military relevance.

      <description>Locked away in the insane prison of their King's body, the Yozis dream, and their sleep is troubled with nightmares of the Bronze Tigers. All too well, they remember the futility of opposing the blades of the Unconquered Sun, and they know that there is nothing-in Creation or beyond-that is not a weapon in the hands of the Dawn Caste. The character may cross-apply his Archery, Martial Arts, Melee, Thrown and War Excellencies. For example, the Solar might use his First War Excellency to organize a coordinated attack upon an Abyssal Exalt, and then in the very next tick use that Excellency to boost his Melee Parry DV against the deathknight's attack. This benefit also applies to the character's Infinite (Ability) Mastery, (Ability) Essence Flow, and Supreme Perfection of (Ability) Charms for the aforementioned Abilities. It is specifically incompatible with Divine Transcendence of (Ability).</description>
      <comment>On Dawn King's Strife: "This is one of the earliest Charms written for this segment, devised by Holden. I consider it to be the pinnacle Charm of the Dawn Solution, exemplifying the principle of combat fusion. Naming it was one of the hardest things to do. I eventually settled on Dawn King's Strife because when you say it aloud it sounds like Don King's Strife. You can't put a price tag on that kind of a bizarre revelation." -Ø</comment>
      <comment>On Dawn King's Strife: "One of the biggest problems plaguing the Dawn Caste has been Infinite Mastery. Infinite Mastery is a lynchpin of Solar power in second edition, but it requires a tremendous Essence investment and carries a significant activation risk. Until now, this has strongly discouraged any sort of multi-ability fighting style: once you put Infinite Mastery up, it would be foolish to use any other combat ability unless forced to. Dawn King's Strife not only solves this problem, but it helps make multi-discipline fighting economically practical for Dawns by getting rid of the need to purchase Excellency suites in four different Abilities." -H</comment>

      <description>There is no such thing as an unprepared Solar warrior. Effortlessly changing tactics to suit the shifting battlefield, the Lawgiver easily keeps pace with the desperate stratagems of his opponents. The Solar may reflexively change which weapon he has readied without the need of a miscellaneous Draw/Ready Weapon action. For example, the Lawgiver could hurl a readied throwing knife into one opponent, reflexively ready his bow, shoot a second opponent, and then pay one mote to reflexively switch to a slashing sword to finish off a third opponent, all in the span of a single flurry. Each shift per action after the first costs one mote.</description>
      <comment>On Elegant Dance Of Bow And Blade: "Send a guy reeling backwards with Heaven Thunder Hammer, make his chest sprout a few blades with Thrown, and then pull out a bow and shoot him before he hits the ground. As you can see, I'm really serious about making you use all your Dawn abilities. See: Perfected Battle Array under Melee." —Ø</comment>
      <comment>On Elegant Dance Of Bow And Blade: "Another issue that has plagued Dawns is that they are the most equipment-dependent Caste, and changing between the tools of the trade has always been stiff and awkward due to the necessities of Draw/Ready miscellaneous actions. Battlefields are now much less safe if a Dawn is on them; you cannot assume that just because your opponent is carrying a daiklave, he doesn't have a brace of knives concealed under his cloak and won't plant them in you in the blink of an eye. This Charm, along with its buddies Supreme Martial Instinct and Dawn King's Strife, allow the Dawns to truly benefit from multi-ability combat investment in a direct manner, rather than just leveraging synergy from Martial and Martial-ready Charms into the one combat ability they actually fight with." -H</comment>

      <description>Solars of the Dawn Caste are the ultimate warriors, allowing an uncanny instinct for battle to inform their every action. Infusing his battle arts with Essence, the Solar's comprehension of combat becomes holistic; his knowledge of an arrow's proper trajectory may guide the path of his sword, and the instinct that turns his fist into a deadly weapon will continue to serve him when guiding knives into the vitals of his enemies. By paying one mote and one Willpower, the Solar raises his ratings in Archery, Martial Arts, Melee, Thrown and War to the value of the highest rating among any of those five Abilities until his DV refreshes. This is considered a natural increase-for example, if the Solar had Dexterity 5, Melee 5, and Archery 1, he would be considered to have Archery 5, and would be able to add up to ten dice to his Dexterity + Archery dice pools. Moreover, the Solar may use the First, Second, or Third Excellencies of his highest-rated Ability to enhance any of those five Abilities until his DV refreshes.</description>
      <comment>On Supreme Martial Instinct: "I developed this Charm around the same time Holden came up with the concept for Dawn King's Strife. This is a less impressive Charm than DKS, but it was important to me to include it to further demonstrate the principles of combat fusion. This Charm models the inherent interconnection of the five combat abilities, allowing the character to - if only for a few seconds - flow between interchangeable battle forms. It also serves as a good example of how the definition of the War ability is expanding to depict a comprehensive understanding of combat." -Ø</comment>
      <comment>On Supreme Martial Instinct: "The price tag and short duration of Supreme Martial Instinct keeps Dawns from losing the signature feel and distinction of their Caste abilities while still enabling some pretty nasty tricks. Using your Archery skills to set up a coordinated attack or your Melee mastery to fight out of a clinch are my two favorites." -H</comment>

      <description>In the heat of battle, giving a Solar time to consider his strategy may be a fatal error. As the Lawgiver formulates a method by which his opponent may be dispatched, he experiences a surge of Essence to compensate his battle strategy. This Charm grants the character a ten-mote Overdrive pool. An activation of this Charm allows the character to gather one offensive mote per tick, to a maximum of ten motes, with which to fill this pool. If the Solar takes any damage to his health track or uses a Charm with one of the Four Flaws of Invulnerability (see Exalted, p. 194) during this time, his concentration is interrupted; the mote gain ceases and the character must repay the activation cost of the Charm if he wishes to resume the effect. The Solar must be in combat and inside a hostile enemy's engagement range in order to use Certain Victory Formulation.</description>

      <description>During the Primordial War, Solar generals often found themselves marching armies against foes whose very shoulders buffeted the skies. From such a vantage, all manner of horrors might be hurled on the heads of the Lawgivers' forces. Only the peerless tactics of the Solar Exalted saved the Celestial Host from such a fate. By paying three motes and activating this Charm, the Solar becomes impossible to target for all opponents outside of his engagement range. Alternately, the Solar may pay an additional one Willpower when activating this Charm to protect a complementary unit he leads.
   This Charm is accomplished by use of terrain; the character uses brilliant combat maneuvers to position himself in a locus of absolute tactical advantage. For one action, the Solar may continue to move himself and his army toward or away from his foe without reprisal. However, any opponent in combat who moves into the Solar's engagement range may target and attack the Exalt. Cover-Shrouding Movement may not be used if the Storyteller determines that there is no possible cover for the Solar to employ. Note, however, that possible does not necessarily mean reasonable - a famous Solar general hid his army in the shadow of Mardukth as he moved his forces in for the kill.

      <description>The Solars used this Charm to sow confusion amongst enemy forces and control the tenor of battle. Upon paying five motes to activate this Charm, the Solar makes a critical combat maneuver which completely obscures him to all opponents in combat, rendering him impossible to target. By paying an additional point of Willpower, the Lawgiver may extend this benefit to a complementary unit he leads. The effect of this maneuver is perfect: it does not require cover. At the beginning of the next tick, when the Solar emerges from cover, all opponents within (Essence x 20) yards are considered to have made a Join Battle roll. Vanishing March Maneuver may not be activated if there are any opponents within 30 yards of the Solar, nor may it be re-used after activation until the character's DV has refreshed five times.</description>

      <description>The Bronze Tigers are cued to the very Essence of combat. Using a preternatural comprehension of all the modes and methods of battle, a Solar may force his opponent into a fatal showdown. A character who activates this Charm is so attuned with the movements of combat that he becomes difficult to attack from a distance. To compensate for this strain, all opponents in combat outside the character's engagement range must pay an extra one mote surcharge on any offensive Charms they wish to launch against the Solar. In addition, all attacks made against the Lawgiver from outside his engagement range suffer a -1 external penalty.</description>
      <comment>On Strife-Drawing Tactic: "This Charm was the beginning of a very serious effort to bring Solars with a solid ground game up to the level of opponents who preferred to fight at range. It led me to invent engagement range as a concept for helping opponents deal with the nigh unassailable efficiency of certain ranged builds. It spawned all the other engagement range Charms which you see here." -Ø</comment>
      <comment>On Strife-Drawing Tactic: "In real combat, the best advantage a fighter can enjoy is reach. If you can hit your opponent and he can't hit you back, the only thing that can make you lose the fight is screwing up and letting him get close to you. Range is a similarly dominant advantage in Exalted, and as a result, Solar Archery in combination with Solar Athletics has always been the game's undisputed top dog battle build. While we didn't want to pull Archery's fangs, we did want to give short-ranged fighters some tools to help deal with long-ranged fighters, so that they didn't 'lose at the select screen', as it were. We also wanted to reduce the necessity for all Dawns to favor Athletics, to mitigate the Caste's 'one true build' issues. Engagement range as a system concept was codified to help solve these problems." -H</comment>

      <description>It is the lot of Solars to stand before the titans and their creations, and to be unafraid -they were made to kill giants. The Solar sets herself into a battle rhythm which causes larger opponents to expose their weak points and get in their own way as they attempt to destroy her; their strength becomes her own. Any warstrider-sized or larger opponent suffers a -3 external penalty on all attempts to strike the Lawgiver, while her own blows ignore half the target's soak and raise the minimum damage of successful attacks by two. The Solar also ignores any Magnitude advantages enjoyed by opponents who are considered to be solo mass combat units due to their vast size, such as Juggernaut. Finally, if facing landscape-scale opponents (such as Mount Mostath or Mother Bog), the Solar may always use that opponent's own bulk as a point of concealment permitting her to attempt to re-establish surprise.
   At War 6+, Essence 6+, while this Charm is active the Solar lowers by one mote (to a minimum of one mote) the cost of all Charms which create undodgeable attacks or cause attacks to be undodgeable, so long as those attacks are directed solely at warstrider-sized or larger opponents.

      <description>In the Era of Dreams, Solars of the Dawn Caste are as legends outside of time, relics of a Primordial War long ended, known for their ability to stand alone against armies. The Lawgiver's insuperable tactics wreak havoc upon enemy formations, turning their numbers into a liability and lessening the effectiveness of their attacks. This Charm may be activated when the Solar fights as a solo unit. All attacks against her by complementary units suffer an external penalty equal to (the total aggregate Magnitude of opponents facing her on the battlefield) - (unit's Might).
   For example, if the Solar faced a force of 10,000 eryman-thoi, split into 10 Magnitude 6 units, this would count as Magnitude 9 opposition, not magnitude 60. Since a unit of erymanthoi enjoys Might 3, each unit's attacks upon the Solar would suffer a -6 external penalty. Were the units composed of mortal soldiers with mundane weapons, the penalty would instead be -9 (reflecting their Might 0).
   The Solar also ignores any formation benefits the unit may enjoy.

      <description>Yozis are one of the greatest challenges a Solar will ever face in combat, for they are not one being, but hundreds. Yet none may stand in superiority to the Solar Exalted. Using Yozi-Fighting Principle, the Lawgiver's killing instinct expands to encompass foes which are armies unto themselves. By conceptualizing all such combatants as intrinsically linked, the character may extend the actions he takes against one opponent to all of them, enabling him to face impossible odds and engage in legendary battles which form the heart of mythology.
   While Yozi-Fighting Principle is in effect, any Charm activated against or in response to a networked being is considered to have had its cost pre-paid for use against all other elements of that networked being. This cost discount applies until the Exalt's next action tick.
   For example: A Solar is attacked by Ligier and activates a Combo of Heavenly Guardian Defense and Solar Counterattack, paying normally for this defense and counterattack. One tick later, he is subjected to a two-attack flurry by Ligier's soul, Gervesin. The character may activate Heavenly Guardian Defense and Solar Counterattack for no cost in response to Gervesin's first attack, but would need to pay for it against his second. Then, one tick after that, Malfeas himself strikes the Solar with a three attack flurry. The Solar may use Solar Counterattack and Heavenly Guardian Defense twice in response to the titan's onslaught for no cost, but would have to pay a third set of activations.
         "Networked beings" are considered to be creatures whose sum totality of being is encompassed by multiple bodies - Yozis and Primordials are the premiere example, but the Emanations of an unshaped raksha also count. This Charm is effective moving both 'up' and 'down' a Yozi's chain of souls - an attack against Gervesin could roll over into a discount against Malfeas as easily as an attack against Malfeas could roll over into a discount against Gervesin. Attacks against Exalted are never discounted, though in the bizarre event that an Exalt somehow began growing subsidiary souls, attacks directed at the Exalt would provide a discount to then target her souls. Exalted akuma form an exception to this rule - they are considered a part of the Yozi they have sold themselves to, and may be fully treated as such by this Charm.
