            <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.
   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        <description>The Solar suffuses his body with the Essence of the Sun. He becomes a paragon of strength and skill, radiant with the power of a legendary hero returned. There is nothing formal to this fighting style, but there is an unstoppable and unchallengeable grace to it. This is an honest battle art, for champions, gladiators and heroes. It was forged in the dawning of the world so that the Lawgivers could face the greatest monsters with nothing save their hands and skill and be undaunted by them.
   This Charm allows the Exalt to count the successes of unarmed Martial Arts attacks twice for the purposes of determining damage. She must spend one mote reflexively in Step 7 of attack resolution each time she takes advantage of this effect. This Charm also allows the character to make an unarmed Martial Arts block against ranged and lethal attacks without a stunt.</description>

        <description>The fury of the Lawgivers scatters their enemies like leaves before the storm. This Charm supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack. It ensures that the Solar's attack throws his enemy backward one yard for each point of pre-soak damage. Targets that strike hard objects take one die of damage for each yard they would otherwise have traveled. This damage is typically bashing but it can be lethal if the target strikes a sufficiently dangerous object.</description>

            <errText>Enhancement: The target is thrown three yards for each point of pre-soak damage. At Essence 4+ the Solar may add one mote to Heaven Thunder Hammer's activation cost in order to send the victim flashing an additional (Essence x 5) yards toward an object he can perceive. This movement occurs before the normal movement caused by Heaven Thunder Hammer begins. This additional knockback distance does not add to the damage the victim takes for yards they would have otherwise traveled, but helps to ensure that the victim strikes a solid object at the absolute beginning of his flight, even if that object is far from the point of attack. This effect expressly allows a Lawgiver to bash a rooted target into scenery within (Essence x 5) yards without actually moving the target. The target does not appear to move; rather nearby walls and trees develop giant craters as if the victim were being driven into them, while the Solar's blows are seen to unleash devastating shockwaves that annihilate the scenery. Treat all such blows as incurring the full damage of a Heaven Thunder Hammer collision at point-blank range. Using this effect turns Heaven Thunder Hammer Obvious. Finally, the cost drops to two motes.</errText>

        <description>The Essence-driven fists of the Solar Exalted can stun even legends, giants, armored cataphractoi and monsters. The Lawgiver spends up to twice his Strength in motes and makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack. If he hits, this Charm replaces his normal damage with stunning damage. He inflicts one die of stunning damage for every mote spent on this Charm. Extra successes add to his damage as usual. Stunning damage ignores natural and armor soak, but it can be soaked with Charms. Each success on the damage roll imposes a -1 penalty to the target's dice pools and DV for the next three actions. This is a Crippling effect (see p. 152).</description>

            <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.
   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        <description>The Lawgivers' arts of battle bring an unrelenting punishment to their enemies. This Charm is a magical flurry of many unarmed Martial Arts-based attacks. The Exalt makes a total number of attacks equal to (her Essence + 1). This Charm lets the Solar make these attacks regardless of her weapon's Rate, without multiple action penalties and with a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty for any one attack. She must make all of her attacks against the same target.</description>

        <description>The Solar burns with Essence. Her strength and agility rise to inhuman levels. This Charm supplements a single attack. It makes the target's Parry DV inapplicable. If the Solar hits, this Charm allows her to make one further unarmed Martial Arts attack by hurling the first opponent into another. This attack has a range of (Martial Arts x 5) yards. It is also unblockable. The first opponent is treated as a weapon with -3 Accuracy and +4B damage. If the attack misses or the Solar targets empty space, the first opponent travels the full (Martial Arts x 5) yards, with effects as noted in Heaven Thunder Hammer.
   Hurling one opponent into another operates with the same timing as a counterattack. This Charm cannot enhance a counterattack, and it prevents the target from responding with Charms with the Counterattack keyword such as Solar Counterattack or Leaping Dodge Method. The second attack is resolved in Step 9 of the original attack and imposes a cumulative counterattack-based penalty of -1 on the Solar's DV.</description>

        <description>A Solar's intercepting fist may even split a bolt of lightning. By paying five motes, the Solar may interrupt an attack made against him with one of his own. This Charm must be activated in step 2. The character rolls a standard unarmed Martial Arts counterattack in Step 6, subtracting her successes from any remaining successes the attacker may have accumulated after comparing his attack to the Solar's DV. The Solar then applies the rolled counterattack to her opponent in Step 9, doing damage as normal if it lands successfully. This counterattack may be used to respond to lethal and ranged attacks, but may not strike an opponent who is out of range, nor may it be used to respond to an unblockable or unexpected attack. An attack negated with this Charm is considered to have been stopped by the Solar's Parry DV.</description>
        <comment>On Break The Storm: "Expanding Solar Hero to encompass more than just brawl concepts begins by giving the style a riff on the greatest martial artist of our time. The intercepting fist seen here will also be repeated in the errata of Crimson Palm Counterstrike, which will subsequently be moved to Throne Shadow Style in the future, along with the other refugees from Sidereal Brawl." -Ø</comment>

        <description>Even in chains a Solar may bring an enemy to his knees. This Charm is identical to Break the Storm, but for the following exceptions: the character may only activate this Charm when he is in a clinch he does not control; this attack is unexpected, and may only be made against opponents who are attempting to attack the Lawgiver while he is being grappled. This Charm guarantees the primacy of this strike; even if all his limbs are bound, the Solar will get a limb momentarily free, or otherwise land a crushing headbutt. This attack does not allow him to escape the clinch; he remains under the control of the clinching opponent until he can win control of the grapple. This Charm has a special interaction with Heaven Thunder Hammer. If the target uses a perfect soak effect to block the damage from a combo in which Chained Thunder Strike and Heaven Thunder Hammer have been triggered simultaneously, the force of the Solar's attack is redirected back through his body at the opponent who is holding him, applying its raw damage to the controlling clincher. If this unexpected attack does damage, both the Lawgiver and the foe clinching him are hurled backwards per the effects of Heaven Thunder Hammer. If they collide with a solid surface, only the Solar's opponent takes any damage from the collision. Chained Thunder Strike is incompatible with Lightning Strikes Twice.</description>

        <description>As the Yozis well know, the Lawgivers have a way of turning certain death into a crushing victory. When in a clinch, the Solar may use this Charm in response to an attack being made against her from outside the grapple. Doing so forces the clinching opponent to suffer all incoming attacks for the rest of the action as though those attacks had been directed at him. This Charm may manifest in a number of ways: the Lawgiver is seen to twist out of the path of a daiklave at the last instant, causing it to shear through her captor; the Exalt exerts superior leverage to drag her opponent into a volley of arrows, using him as a shield. In any case, the Solar clearly demonstrates to her foes why they should not touch what they cannot hold.
   If used in response to an area-of-effect attack encompassing the Solar and the one grappling her, such as Death of Obsidian Butterflies or a supernatural ice storm, the Solar reduces the effect's raw damage by half (round up) and adds this amount to the raw damage inflicted on the character clinching her.
   This Charm offers no benefits if the Solar is not in a clinch.</description>

            <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.
   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        <description>To be caught in the grip of an enraged Solar is a terrifying prospect, for their mighty hands may rend even the makers of the universe. The Solar may activate this Charm to enhance a crush action when she has control of a clinch. No matter how large the opponent, the Lawgiver's strain pulls her foe into the air over her head, where she may shake it violently, causing its bones, organs, limbs - or souls - to smash together, colliding repeatedly as the Solar thrashes her victim like a ragdoll. The Solar re-applies steps 7-10 of attack resolution (Essence + 1) times, repeatedly damaging her victim.
   If the target is warstrider-sized or larger, double the raw damage from these attacks. If the target is a landscape-scale or larger (such as Mount Mostath), multiply the raw damage by five. Used against such enormous targets, the Charm becomes Obvious.</description>

        <description>To provoke the ire of a Lawgiver is to bring down the thunder. Upon paying the activation cost of this Charm, the Solar may make up to (Dexterity x 2) attacks against a single opponent or (Dexterity / 2, round up) attacks against all opponents within (Dexterity) yards, contingent on the following factors: the Solar must make each attack with a different improvised weapon; the Solar  seizes and swings a different object with each attack; each improvised weapon may not be reused during the tick these attacks occur on; the Solar may only use objects within (Dexterity) yards; and only objects the Storyteller deems the Solar can lift and swing may be employed. Upon a successful hit, every character struck with this Charm must roll (Dexterity + Athletics) at difficulty 2 or suffer knockdown. In addition, suitably large objects (such as banquet hall tables, wooden beams, or temple pillars, subject to the Storyteller's discretion) may be used to strike all opponents within (Dexterity) yards, even when the character has chosen only one target for this Charm; if he has chosen multiple targets, this attack does not reduce the number of attacks he may make against each target singly. Lastly, if the Storyteller deems there are no objects for the Solar to wield, this Charm may not be used, and if the Solar runs out of appropriate props to attack with, the Charm ends prematurely. All objects wielded with this Charm are considered to have accuracy +1 in spite of their improvised status. The first unwitting victim of this Charm was a Lunar stalker who offended a Solar in an emporium of musical instruments.</description>
        <comment>On Teahouse-Shattering Symphony: "This Charm has been sitting in my notes for almost a year now. Mostly it was just the line about the Solar, the Lunar, and the music emporium. Don't cry, Inugami - the Lunar got a date with her eventually." -Ø</comment>

        <description>Before the Solar Exalted, light could only chase shadow; due to the Lawgivers, it may capture it as well. This Charm may enhance a Martial Arts attack. The character lashes out at his target's shadow, pinning it to the ground, a wall, a tree or other immobile scenery; this attack is unblockable and undodgeable without the use of magic. When pinned in such a way, the victim is trapped within a yard of his shadow until he is able to pull it free, a feat requiring a miscellaneous (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty of the Solar's (Martial Arts rating x 2). The successes gained on multiple attempts to pull free are added together cumulatively, but the target may make only one such attempt per action. While rooted, the target may not be moved by knockback effects; if knocked back, such as by Heaven Thunder Hammer, the target is considered to strike a hard surface after traveling only one yard.</description>
        <comment>On Shadow Foot Trap: "You might think that this Charm is manifestly better with Archery and Thrown, and you'd be right, but then you'd still be thinking like a non-Dawn. A Dawn would pin his opponent's shadow with a dirk and then run up and hit him with a combo of the Hammer on Iron Technique and Heaven Thunder Hammer. As of the errata, HTH has a special interaction with Shadow Foot Trap that will blow you away." -Ø</comment>

        <description>The Solar's might is such as to knock a star from the sky or place one into orbit. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite, adding an additional (Essence x 5) yards to the distance a target can be launched on a successful hit, as well as allowing the character to use Heaven Thunder Hammer to launch a foe straight up. The rules for targets impacting with solid objects as a result of this Charm remain otherwise unchanged, though it is worth noting that what goes up must come down; it is entirely possible an opponent might be smashed into a high ceiling and then have to contend with falling damage.</description>

        <description>This Charm offers a permanent upgrade to Heaven Thunder Hammer and Crashing Wave Throw. On a successful knockback or throw using either of those Charms, while the target is still hurtling towards its doom but before they have collided with a solid object, the Solar may pay two motes and one Willpower, activating Lightning Strikes Twice to make a second attack against his opponent. Doing so cancels the collision effect of those Charms, but allows the Solar to make an unexpected attack against the target, taking advantage of its helpless flight. The Solar flashes instantly across the distance from the ground to his hurtling foe, appearing alongside his opponent to make this attack, automatically intercepting his target on the last instant before any collision with scenery or natural termination of the target's flight could possibly occur. When using Archery or Thrown to make this unexpected attack, the Solar need not personally follow the target. Instead, his ranged attack flashes into position beside the target before completing the attack, ignoring the weapon's Range value. Lightning Strikes Twice may not be triggered more than once on a single tick against a single target.</description>
        <comment>On Lightning Strikes Twice: "This is the first Charm I wrote without any assistance. I drew on my history as a fighting gamer for the inspiration for this Charm. It and the Charms which follow allow you to pull off an aerial rave. This is the first Charm technology of its kind in Exalted, and I think it will be important for future Charm design. I call this technology a Jeopardy Offense because if you get hit by the first Charm you may have to contend with the effects of a second more dangerous attack." -Ø</comment>

            <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.

   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        <description>Moving with incomparable speed, the Solar may snap out multiple strikes in a single motion, defying all notions of having any peer. Though Solar Combination is an Extra Action Charm, the Solar makes only a single Martial Arts attack roll. On a successful strike, the Solar is seen to strike his foe (Essence) times. For each of these blows, the target suffers a -1 internal penalty until the Solar's next action. This attack ignores armor and natural soak, but may be soaked with magic. While the target only takes damage from a single attack roll, any Charms used in conjunction with Solar Combination which cause stunning (see Exalted, p. 153) have their effects applied to each strike incurred by this Charm. The character pays the activation cost of such Charms only once to benefit from Solar Combination's modifier, as if they were applying it to a single attack, rather than an Extra Action effect. At Essence 7+ Solar Combination may be used as a Supplemental Charm.</description>

        <description>The Solar Hero's lot is to stand against the forces of evil. All of them. Often a Solar cannot pick where or when these battles must be fought. This Charm creates a new Essence pool capable of storing up to ten motes of Peripheral Essence for the Solar, in accordance with the Overdrive Keyword. Whenever an opponent rolls Join Battle, the Solar experiences a surge of adrenaline which adds a number of motes equal to (half the opponent's Essence, rounded up) to this temporary pool.</description>
        <comment>On Hero's Fatal Resolve: "I wrote the idea and a few lines of the description for this Charm a good eight or so months ago. Back then I hadn't invented Overdrive yet, so this Charm was going to just give you regular motes. Because we have enough Reactor Charms, I was going to leave this one in my notes forever. After I came up with the new design for Essence-Gathering Temper, I got interested in HFR again, and retooled it to match the new EGT. Once I realized the technology from EGT was viable design space, it began to make its way into more Charm concepts, warranting the invention of the Overdrive Keyword. In an odd twist, I almost forgot to put the Keyword on this Charm, as it was the first of the bunch to be written, but its invention predated Overdrive's codification into the Dawn Solution." -Ø</comment>

        <description>In a moment of pristine stillness, the Solar's inner eye opens. Caught between calm and storm, she becomes the channel through which all forces flow, and that which would tear her asunder is cast aside. When the character is struck by a close-range attack, she may activate this Charm to make an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack against her opponent - specifically, a clinch attempt. If successful, the Lawgiver melds the course of her opponent's attack into a throw to the ground or a solid surface within up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards, inflicting the pre-soak damage of the attack which triggered this Charm upon the unlucky opponent.
   Alternately, the Lawgiver may choose to hurl her victim at another foe within range of the throw. This is modeled as a second (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack with a base damage equal to the raw damage of the attack which triggered One With the Wave.
   At Essence 4+, the Solar may use One With the Wave to respond to successful ranged attacks using physical projectiles. In this case she appears to be scathed by the missile, curling along the angle of the shot to pluck it from the air and whip it back at her opponent. This (Dexterity + Martial Arts) counterattack has a range of the Solar's line of sight and a base damage equal to the attack's raw damage against her. At Essence 5+, the Solar may use One With the Wave to answer energy-based attacks, channeling them directly through her body and back at her enemies.</description>

A hand that lies has no strength over the Lawgiver, and only the truest salvos may strike the Solar Hero. A character activating this Charm modifies his opponent's attacks. For one action, all attacks against the Exalt suffer an internal penalty equal to the difference between the Ability being used and the lowest of the attacker's Archery, Martial Arts, Melee and Thrown ratings. Daunting the False Savior must be activated while the character is using a Form-Type Charm and may expressly enhance any Form-Type Charm the character knows.

        <description>It is within the skill of the Solar Exalted to sear the souls of their lessers with a taste of true power. Those so enlightened are rarely ever the same again. This Charm supplements all Martial Arts attacks the Solar makes while it is active. On a successful strike, the character's anima irradiates the target, suffusing her Essence pathways with a constricting flow of overwhelming Solar Essence. Every time the target is struck with this Charm, the activation cost of her next Charm rises by two motes to a maximum surcharge of the Solar's Essence rating. In addition, the next Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability that the target wishes to activate costs an additional one Willpower. If two or more Solars strike the same target with Sun-Suffusing Slag, the mote surcharge on her Charms may only be increased to the rating of the highest-Essence Solar to strike her; individual lower-Essence Solars may not exceed their own Essence maximums for the purpose of stacking this surcharge. Furthermore, the Willpower surcharge to Charms possessing a Flaw of Invulnerability incurred by this Charm is never stackable. Exalts other than Solar Exalted who are continually struck with Sun-Suffusing Slag begin to exhibit Solar anima bleeding through their own anima displays as they continue to expend Essence in order to expel the Solar's irradiating influence.</description>
        <comment>On Sun-Suffusing Slag: "I wrote this Charm while working on Dreams. I had just codified the Martial and Martial-Ready Keywords. As such, this was the first Charm to receive the Martial Keyword. For that precise reason it did not make it into Dreams of the First Age; it would have taken up too much space to explain the Keyword, and would have tipped my hand on the Dawn Solution." -Ø</comment>

        <description>The Solar's might is like a black hole, having gravity sufficient to crush worlds with his fist. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite. On a successful strike with Heaven Thunder Hammer, the character may choose to spend up to his Strength rating in motes for the purpose of subtracting yards from the distance his target would have flown, to a minimum of zero yards. This creates a well of force which sucks the victim in, preventing him from being launched away as the Solar visibly strains against his own might, gathering a terrible force which spills out into the surrounding landscape, shattering scenery and fracturing air at the motonic level. This moment of devastating collision cannot last. A blast tears through his victim as the Solar completes his attack. The target is ripped away with the force of a hurricane and hurled across the landscape. Multiply the number of reduced yards by three and convert them into automatic damage. Add (Essence) to the number of yards which remain from the effects of Heaven Thunder Hammer for calculating the total distance the target will fly after breaking the Solar's inertia. These extra yards are treated exactly as those accumulated by this Charm's prerequisite. The target suffers any impact with scenery as per the rules of Heaven Thunder Hammer.</description>

        <description>The loftiest works of men, gods, and Primordials alike are as dust before the fury of the Solar Exalted. This Charm supplements an unarmed Martial Arts attack directed against a nonmagical structure. The Solar ignores the structure's soak, hardness, and health levels, and automatically destroys a volume of the structure encompassing (Essence x 10) yards from the point of the attack's impact, distributed as the player sees fit. At Martial Arts 6+, Essence 6+ this Charm may be activated for a cost of ten motes, one Willpower to encompass a volume of (Essence x 50) yards. This tends to cause palaces to collapse, city walls to crumble, and the sides of mountains to cave in. At Martial Arts 7+, Essence 7+ this Charm may also be applied to non-imperishable magical structures.</description>

        <description>This Charm offers a permanent upgrade to Crashing Wave Throw, allowing the Charm to throw victims an additional (Martial Arts x 10) yards upward and (Martial Arts x 20) yards horizontally.
   In addition to this benefit, by paying an additional five motes upon activating Crashing Wave Throw, the character may further enhance the effect of the Charm. The Solar violently swings his victim through the air until they blaze like the aura of a re-entry. Charged by the Solar's wrathful judgment, the victim is turned into a missile upon release, and may be aimed at further targets of the Lawgiver's animosity. In addition to the normal effects of Crashing Wave Throw, where the victim lands, the blazing Essence of the Solar's wrath detonates like a bomb: the victim and all other unfortunates within (Solar's Essence x 2) yards are subjected to a one-time environmental damage effect with Damage 10L, Trauma 3. This damage is multiplied by five against objects and structures. The Solar's killing intent fuels this Charm's explosive effect, and so it may not be used to turn willing allies with perfect soak effects into impromptu artillery, nor may it be used on objects or inanimate corpses. It also may not be used on extras.</description>
        <comment>On Cancel The Apocalypse: "If you came this far into Solar Hero Style, you are obviously the most bad-assed character ever in Exalted. Unfortunately, Solars don't hurl thunderbolts. Fortunately they don't have to. Express your disapproval of a Deathlord's machinations by turning his favorite deathknight into a starbolt and hurling him through the Deathlord's front door." -Ø</comment>

        <description>A Lawgiver who suffers the works of the wicked is not patient, only busy. Cast Down Stars Condemnation makes a Solar's feelings known-in the form of absolute destruction unleashed. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite; upon activating it, the Solar may pay an additional ten motes, one Willpower for the following benefits: First, double the raw damage the target suffers from colliding with an object. Next, increase the base environmental damage produced by the victim's impact detonation to 20L. Finally, upon impact the victim plows through scenery like a falling star, shattering the landscape and creating a massive explosion while his body digs a gigantic trench in the earth or bowls through towers, devastating a skyline. In addition to the enhanced base damage of Cancel the Apocalypse, all non-artifact scenery within (Solar's Essence x 100) yards of the victim's point of impact takes an arbitrary amount of damage sufficient to destroy it. The Storyteller may describe this destruction as multiple explosions that level a city, massive shockwaves that flatten a forest, terrifying implosions that leave a mountainside a smoking crater, and so forth. This Charm may not be used if the hurled opponent's Essence rating is lower than 4.</description>

        <description>For the most part, the Solar Hero is a picture of gentility. However, the ill-timed flailing of an assassin or a Yozi with poor table manners may catch a Lawgiver in the worst of moods. The Solar may activate this Charm to make an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack in response to a successful close range attack. On a successful counterattack, rather than inflicting damage, the Solar automatically throws his opponent 100 yards for every die of pre-soak damage on the attack that triggered Sky Breaker Throw, inflicting appropriate falling damage on impact. If the attack exceeds 20 pre-soak dice, Sky Breaker Throw hurls the opponent ten miles. If the Solar uses Sky Breaker Throw to respond to an attack inflicting 30+ pre-soak damage, the Solar may fling his opponent from his position half the distance across Creation.
   Against an attack of 50+ raw damage, the range of the throw becomes infinite, allowing the character to designate a fitting location for his foe to touch down. For example, the Solar may choose to bounce his victim off the tip of the Imperial Mountain, in which case the target is catapulted to one of the far ends of Creation. Alternately, the character may express his displeasure by hurling his victim into the heart of the sun. If the Solar is particularly wroth however, he may fling his foe out into the stars, where his victim smashes through an unseen layer of Creation and comes screaming down over the brass skyline of Malfeas to leave a crater in the street. Any impact triggered by a throw of 20 or more pre-soak dice carries a penalty of arbitrarily high damage, sufficient to kill on impact. Due to a peculiarity in the distance between Creation and the Demon City, if the Lawgiver's victim survives being slammed into Malfeas, he will be unable to move from his crater of impact for five days, until time has caught up with him. Being targeted with a social or physical attack causes time to catch up with the character, allowing him to rise and act as normal. The player and Storyteller may work together to come up with additional interesting results for a throw of this magnitude. Note that Sky Breaker Throw requires that the victim be hurled into a specific location; the player may not choose to throw his victim into a limitless vacuum of empty space or send them infinitely sailing across the Wyld.
   When used in realms other than Creation, Sky Breaker Throw may not be used to throw opponents into Creation save through stable passage points (such as a shadowland during the day, or an open portal between Creation and Autochthonia; under no circumstances may a Yozi be hurled out of Malfeas). Players should work with their Storyteller to define new and interesting parameters for a victim's landing inside of their current realm. Possibilities include, while fighting in the Underworld, banking the First and Forsaken Lion off the well of Stygia and into the maw of Oblivion; or while in Malfeas, throwing Ligier down Isidoros's throat.
   This Charm's magic will not function without the Solar channeling his retributive fury into it; as such, it may never be used for the purpose of intentionally facilitating rapid transportation, rather than acting as a weapon.</description>

        <description>A child must learn to crawl before it can walk, just as the wicked must learn to fly before they can stand against the Solar Hero. The character's fist becomes a falling star, striking the earth to unleash a shockwave that rips through the ground in a straight line up to (Essence x 50) yards distant. Upon reaching an opponent in range, the attack terminates in a massive detonation of force, with a diameter of 10 yards and reaching up to 100 yards high. Everything caught in the range of this attack is immediately hit by an unblockable Heaven Thunder Hammer strike using a dice pool of (Dexterity + Martial Arts + Essence). Characters struck by this attack are always launched up or away from the Lawgiver. The Solar is immune to the effects of his own attack and may stand in the absolute center of this devastation unharmed.</description>

        <description>The killer instinct of the Solar Hero is sufficient to break an opponent's strategy. Whenever the Solar uses a Martial Arts attack to do at least three lethal or aggravated or six bashing health levels of damage to his opponent, he may pay five motes to remove that damage from the attack. This may reduce levels of damage inflicted on his opponent to 0. Instead of taking the full damage of the Solar's attack, his victim's Form is broken; that is, if his opponent had a Form-Type Martial Arts Charm active, a successful application of Stance Breaker Instinct removes it from the target. Victims of this attack may still find themselves injured or killed by the attack. As a point of clarification, if the attack on the damage does more than three lethal or six bashing levels, the remaining health levels of damage still apply.
   Furthermore, the Exalt may not knock the same Martial Arts Form-Type Charm off her target more than once in ten actions. Having knocked her opponent out of form, she may attack different Form-Types her opponent assumes before ten actions have been completed, but doing so resets the ten action count for all Form-Type Charms she has knocked off her opponent in the current battle. For example, the Lawgiver may punch her opponent hard enough to knock him out of Tiger Form; five actions later, she knocks him out of Snake Form; she may not remove either Tiger or Snake Form from her opponent for another ten actions. As a further point of clarity, two or more Solars attacking a single opponent with this Charm track these actions separately.</description>

            <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.
   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        </prerequest>
        <description>This Charm allows the Lawgiver to deliver an ironic comeuppance to his enemy. Whenever the Solar uses a throw to ram his opponent into scenery, or a Charm which causes such an impact directly (such as Heaven Thunder Hammer), he may pay six motes to trigger this Charm's effects:
• When the opponent impacts with a solid surface, the impact causes extreme damage to the structure in question. To determine how much damage is done, use the Lawgiver's ratings to roll a (Dexterity + Martial Arts + Essence) dice attack against the structure in question. Treat this attack as one being enhanced by Sledgehammer Fist Punch (see Exalted, p. 242), doubling the pre-soak damage of the attack.
• When the target takes health levels of damage from such an impact, the Exalt's player may choose to defer a number of health levels from the victim and transfer them into the structure his victim has impacted with. Each health level deferred in this way translates to five automatic levels of damage done to the structure in question. If the attack would have been sufficient to kill the opponent, and accrued more than seven successes on the damage roll, the damage done to the structure is automatically sufficient to destroy it.
• If the opponent takes any health levels of damage upon impact, he is dazed by the collision and takes a -5 internal penalty as a Crippling effect for one action. This effect applies even if the Lawgiver uses this Charm to reduce the health levels of damage his victim receives to 0.
   At Essence 4+ this Charm expressly allows the Solar to destroy magical objects or structures, but does not allow him to destroy imperishable objects or structures (such as daiklaves or the Imperial Manse). In addition, victims of this Charm may never be used to destroy magical objects or structures they do not own (see Exalted, p. 238). Therefore, hurling a peasant at his master's manse will only make a mess, rather than destroy the manse.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances both Crashing Wave Throw and Heaven Thunder Hammer. The character may pay three additional motes when activating either of those Charms. Calculate the damage on impact as normal. However, as the tremendous force of the Solar's attack vibrates through the world at the point of impact, a shockwave flings the opponent back towards the Solar, allowing the Exalt to apply a finishing move which deals (Essence) automatic levels of damage to the victim in step 10, to a maximum of five health levels of damage. The finishing move is not a second attack roll but rather a second visual consequence of the first attack. If the character takes no health levels of damage from a collision with scenery caused by Crashing Wave Throw or Heaven Thunder Hammer, he is unaffected by the shockwave and Second Impact Flourish automatically fails.
   For this Charm, distance is important: the Solar must be in range in order to add this damage to his enemy. To determine range, use the yards the victim would have flown on impact to determine how far he is flung back toward the Exalt. If the Solar is in range, the victim is seen to be catapulted back into the Lawgiver's finishing move. Finishing moves may take a form defined by the player. Example finishing moves include a flying uppercut that blows the opponent's falling body out of the air, or leaping backwards to catch the target in a flying backflip suplex that leaves a crater in the street.</description>

        </prerequest>
        <description>This Charm upgrades its prerequisites, allowing the Solar to pay six motes, one Willpower to activate Lightning Strikes Twice against multiple opponents simultaneously. The Solar may make a single unexpected attack against (Dexterity + 3) targets, with the same rules and limitations as Lightning Strikes Twice. During this time he is seen to blur across the sky in every direction, flashing from target to target, striking blows against each while his anima flares and strobes like the violent concatenation of a lightning storm. Using Storm Burst Explosion counts as an activation of Lightning Strikes Twice, preventing the Solar from re-using that Charm unless he has Split the Chase. Should the character use Heaven Thunder Hammer and Split the Chase to reactivate Lightning Strikes Twice against multiple opponents through the use of this Charm, the arc of flashing recursions is seen to crawl ever outward from the center of impact, leaving blazing jags across the sky and flashing at each point of impact. This attack may be driven through a third iteration through the application of Flicker-Fade Recursion.
   As with Lightning Strikes Twice, the character may opt not to follow his opponents, choosing instead to make an unexpected ranged attack against each of them. This attack follows the same rules as those in Lightning Strikes Twice, except that the Exalt splits this attack amongst multiple opponents. When using Storm Burst Explosion, the character may select which valid targets to strike and may choose to ignore valid targets, allowing them to collide with scenery per the rules of Heaven Thunder Hammer.</description>

The Solar's unarmed attacks automatically stun opponents they strike and roll damage against (see Exalted, p. 153). This stunning effect is cumulative - if a Solar made a three-attack flurry and struck his opponent with all three attacks, his target would suffer a -6 internal penalty until the Solar's next action.</description>

   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        <description>Once a Lawgiver has laid his hand upon an enemy, his wrath becomes inescapable. Even the Primordials learned this, to their sorrow. This Charm may be used to enhance a roll to maintain or gain control of an ongoing grapple, giving it an automatic threshold of one success more than the Solar's opponent. If another effect contests this one, add (Essence) in extra dice to the resulting roll.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Martial Arts 9+, Essence 9+, allows it to be invoked as an inherent ability, which does not count as a Charm activation.

        <description>The character concentrates vast amounts of Essence around her hands, inflicting terrible wounds with an unarmed attack. The character's blow inflicts lethal damage. When she uses it against a living target, this Charm adds a bonus to the raw damage of the attack equal to the attacking character's permanent Essence. This Charm is far more effective against inanimate targets, though. If the character attacks such a target while using this Charm, add a number of damage levels (not dice) equal to four times the attacking character's permanent Essence.</description>

For the rest of the scene, the character adds a number of levels (not dice) of damage equal to twice his permanent Essence to all Martial Arts attacks. When this Charm is performed, the character specifies whether these attacks inflict bashing or lethal damage. He can even choose to inflict bashing damage when wielding a weapon that would normally inflict lethal damage (for example, smashing an enemy across the temple with the hilt of a khatar).</description>

        <description>The Solar meditates for five minutes, sinking into a trancelike state of concentration to let her martial skill reach an instinctive level. Her player then rolls the character's (Wits + Martial Arts), adding a number of successes equal to the character's Essence. The Solar may spend a Willpower point on the roll, augment it with Charms or use any other appropriate normal method for improving the success of this roll, and the player carefully notes the number of successes she achieves. At some time later in the scene, the Solar may reflexively replace the results of any single Martial Arts roll with the successes the player rolled during the activation of this Charm. Doing so replaces the chosen roll in its entirety, and any bonuses that applied to the previous roll are lost. After this Charm has replaced a Martial Arts roll, the Charm expires, and the character must activate it again if she wants to reap its benefits again. A Solar may freely end the Charm before she uses its effects if her player rolls poorly upon activation and wants to try her luck again. While activating Inevitable Victory Meditation counts as the Solar's Charm use for the action, replacing the successes of a later roll does not. A Solar may wait for her opponent to roll for his defense before replacing the successes of her attack roll. A Solar cannot have more than one activation of this Charm ongoing at any given time.</description>

        <description>A master warrior has complete knowledge of his surroundings as a fight rages on. A Solar master of this technique instinctively uses everything around him to his advantage. Fighters with this Charm have a reputation for foolhardy bravery and dumb luck, for they make use of surprising and spectacular aspects of the fight, from props to scenery to their opponents' own weapons and attacks.
   Any time a Solar gains bonus dice from a stunt, his player may spend three motes per stunt die to convert each stunt die into an automatic success. (That is, if the Storyteller awards three stunt dice, the Solar's player can spend nine motes to turn all three dice into automatic successes). To use this Charm, the Solar must make use of his surroundings or some ongoing aspect of the fight - such as by levering a soldier around into his comrades by the haft of his spear. He can also use this Charm when he performs a surprisingly brave or foolhardy act - such as leaping from the crow's nest of a ship to rain a thunderous elbow drop down onto a Child of Siakal in the water.</description>

        <description>To achieve her true Solar greatness, a master warrior must challenge herself constantly against foes of at least equal greatness. Those who have mastered this Charm understand this principle, throwing themselves at more and more talented foes to feel the joy of battle. Anytime the Solar successfully defends herself from an attack that accumulated no fewer successes than either the Solar's Essence or 5 (whichever is higher), she may activate this Charm to gain a temporary Willpower point. That is, the Solar's Dodge or Parry DV (including any bonuses from weapons, shields or magical effects) must completely cancel out an attack roll of no fewer than the aforementioned number of successes. This Charm does not allow the Solar to gain more temporary Willpower than her permanent rating. Simply having the fortitude or the armor to absorb all the damage inflicted by an attack does not qualify as a successful defense for the purposes of activating this Charm.</description>

        <description>In war, in skirmish or in single combat, no single side of a conflict entirely determines its outcome. Ultimate victory depends not just on the victor's skill and power, but on his ability to read his opponent, to react to him and to manipulate him into a position of weakness. This Charm enhances that ability in a Solar warrior. Anytime an enemy takes a physical action against the Solar in combat, the Solar may reflexively activate this Charm in response. The Solar's player commits one mote per success that the character's opponent's player made on his attack roll. At any time during the scene, the Solar may "cash in" those committed motes to add one die per mote to any Martial Arts roll. Each die added reduces the Essence committed by one mote.
   A Solar must choose to add dice to his roll before the player makes his roll. Activating this Charm counts as a Charm use for that action, but cashing in the committed motes later to gain the bonus dice doesn't.
   A Solar may activate Supremacy of War Method multiple times in a scene to increase his total committed motes, but he may never have more motes committed to Supremacy of War Method than his (Wits + Martial Arts).</description>

        <description>When the Solar martial artist activates this fantastic display of power, her anima flares to full totemic glory and she is reshaped, her body marked by her totem and the colors associated with her caste. (A Twilight Caste with the totem of the lion might gain a thick mane of dark hair, as well as sharp teeth and orange or black eyes). In this temporary state of power, the Solar's player adds her character's Essence in automatic successes to any combat actions she makes - excluding damage rolls. The number of added successes cannot exceed the number of dice the player rolls. Extra dice received from Charms do not count toward this limit, but dice gained from channeling a Virtue do.
   Once this Charm expires, the character may reflexively renew it (though doing so counts as her Charm activation for that subsequent action). Doing so costs her no Essence or Willpower, but the player must roll the character's highest Virtue on every action for which she extends the Charm. Each success increases her Limit by one. Should the Solar suffer Limit Break during the use of this Charm, she does not actually undergo the effects of the Limit Break (yet) but frenzies as per Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer Spirit. Should this happen, the Ascendant Battle Visage's bonuses remain for the rest of the scene. The actual effects of the Limit Break, including the bonus to Willpower, begin after the scene ends.</description>

            <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.
   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.</description>

        <description>The character's fists blaze with the revelatory truth of the Unconquered Sun. This Charm may be activated whenever the Solar successfully strikes a being with an unarmed attack. Tongues of cleansing golden flames erupt from the target's eyes and mouth and she screams in pain as every instance of unnatural mental influence affecting her abruptly terminates regardless of source or potency. Only the fealty of akuma, the bindings of demons, the Great Curse and similarly inviolable effects chosen by the Storyteller ignore this Charm.</description>

            <description>Three times during the First Age, deer-footed Mara concocted grand and insidious schemes to bring low the Chosen of Creation. Three times, her plans came to naught. Mara's prestige within Malfeas remains undiminished despite these failures, for the tools of her ambition still abide in the world and much cautionary lore regarding them has vanished in the fires of cataclysm and revolt. The Black Claw style was her second plan, and while it failed, it has not passed from existence and might still bear fruit in this Age or the next.
   Also known variously as the Fainting Maiden style or the Mouse-Seizes-Bear Art, Black Claw style utilizes the tools of misdirection, perception and love as its primary weapons. Victory is grasped by opening oneself utterly to the aggressions of one's foe so that he castigates himself as thoroughly as his victim. Defeat is mollified by exposing the perfidy of the victorious.
    Black Claw style has two qualities that differentiate it from other Celestial Martial Arts. First, like all demon-created Celestial arts, any demon of any circle may practice the style so long as the spirit satisfies all relevant trait minimums. Second, Mara's association with perverse relationships bleeds into every Charm, inseparably binding sifu and student. It is impossible to know the secrets of this style without being exposed to the innermost heart of one's instructor, and impossible to understand that knowledge without accepting what is within that heart. So it is that every Black Claw practitioner bears an Intimacy of genuine and unbreakable love toward his teacher. No amount of natural persuasion or scenes spent working against this love can weaken the Intimacy. Only unnatural mental influence can sever the emotional connection, and even then, every scene in which the character invokes a Black Claw style Charm counts as a scene spent rebuilding the Intimacy.
   This style gained popularity in Creation during the First Deliberative Era of the Old Realm. Its practice, which began among several of Brigid's students, quickly flourished throughout the Solar and Lunar community. Its first Exalted practitioners viewed the style as a quaint and amusing demon-trap, its dangers easily seen and avoided so that its benefits could be enjoyed. However, as the art spread far and wide, it came to be regarded with unease - while conquered demons were of no threat to the Realm, the idea of a power bloc forming among young Solars bonded in love to a handful of mighty teachers (all the worse if those teachers were Lunars, or Sidereals!) was quite alarming. So it was that after a few short centuries Queen Merela outlawed the style and brutally suppressed its schools. Those without the personal or political power to ignore the law were bonded in Eclipse-sanctified oaths to forsake the practice of the style. Save for a handful of lovestruck outlaws, it fell from the history of Creation.
   The Black Claw style likewise proved disruptive to the regimented chaos of the Demon City. Because it allowed the weak to bond the mighty to themselves in chains of love, Cecelyne issued a partial proscription against the style, sanctioning its use only by citizens of Malfeas. Orabilis, who does not consider love to be a form of wisdom, tasked his soul Florivet with rooting out illegal schools within the Demon City. However, the Whim-of-the-Wind has rarely bothered looking since he became an adventurer. On the rare occasions when he uncovers demonic serfs making unauthorized use of the Black Claw, he defeats them in gaudy and spectacular public fights, but this happens less and less as time goes on. The public resentment against him after such battles makes Florivet sullen and unenthusiastic.
   Now, as the Reclamation begins, Black Claw style is experiencing a resurgence. Mara has already taken on several Green Sun Princes as students (and lovers), and it will not be long before they establish their first school in Creation.
   Weapons and Armor: Black Claw style may only be practiced with bare hands, and without armor. An appearance of martial readiness would undermine practitioners' posture of unjustly assaulted innocence.
   Complementary Abilities: To properly grasp the insights upon which the style is founded, a student must possess at least two dots spread in any fashion among Larceny, Socialize and Performance.</description>

        <description>From the beginning, things start to go wrong. Righteous heroes find themselves cast as a vicious bullies when they fight a student of the Black Claw-even if the martial artist picked the fight himself. This Charm supplements a Join Battle action, adding the user's Essence in bonus successes.
       Regardless of whether the Join Battle roll permits the martial artist to act first, compare the result to the Dodge MDV of all other characters who witness the fight begin (including all combatants). If the roll result is higher, they suffer an unnatural Illusion effect which costs two Willpower to resist, convincing them that the martial artist's opponents initiated hostilities. This even applies to the opponents themselves, who may suddenly find themselves quite confused about why they are attacking the character. Characters that do not pay this cost upfront can pay four Willpower to correct their memories later, but only with external prompting or a compelling personal reason to question the memory and not until a day has passed since they last encountered the martial artist. Minds need distance from such a toxic presence before they can think clearly. This Charm may enhance only the first Join Battle roll the character makes in a fight.</description>

        <description>Every Black Claw student must submit to his sifu. As one whose heart has already been conquered, he knows that any greater defeat is impossible. The martial artist draws on the memory of his love and channels it into his stance, projecting unmistakable and fragile resolution: a sight to move the hearts of gods and demons alike.
   This Charm may be invoked when the character successfully negates an attack with his DV. The aggressor is struck by the character's posture of resolute defiance, and treats the successful defense as a scene spent working toward building a positive Intimacy for the martial artist. The specific emotional context of the Intimacy, be it respect, admiration, or even unexpected love, depends on the context of the situation and may be chosen by the attacker's player. This unnatural mental influence costs one Willpower to resist.
   This Charm will not function if evoked in conjunction with a Charm possessing a Flaw of Invulnerability (or equivalent effect, such as an Infernal Imperfection); the martial artist's beauty lies in his weakness, not his invulnerable strength.</description>

        <description>Even for the unjustly wronged, there comes a time to strike back. Students of the Black Claw opt to do so with deceptive force. By paying three motes to supplement an unarmed attack, the martial artist's hand becomes wreathed in a bilious green spray of Essence. If the attack hits, it inflicts normal damage and the victim becomes afflicted with a dose of poison with the following statistics: (7L/action, 3, -/-, -2). This poison is exceptionally subtle, displaying no outward symptoms as it destroys its victim from the inside. By paying four motes instead, the martial artist may veil his strike in an unnatural Illusion effect, removing the Obvious tag for all observers save the Charm's target. This Illusion may be ignored by observers who spend one Willpower.</description>

        <description>The martial artist assumes a defensive posture, equally declarative of his unwillingness to fight and his readiness to defend himself regardless. During Step 9 of any attack directed against him, the character may pay one mote to leap away from his aggressor (Appearance) yards, although the character does not actually move until after Step 10 has been resolved.
   Additionally, as only a brute would assault such a reluctant opponent, each attack directed at the character causes any onlookers to act as though the attacker had just spent a scene eroding any positive Intimacies they might feel toward him. This unnatural Emotion effect costs one Willpower to ignore for the rest of the scene with regard to that attacker. Witnesses with higher Essence than the Charm's user who pay this cost ignore its influence with regard to all attackers.
   Finally, the character may parry lethal and ranged attacks without a stunt or Charm, and Torn Lotus Defense does not count as a Charm activation while this Form is active.</description>

            <description>Three times during the First Age, deer-footed Mara concocted grand and insidious schemes to bring low the Chosen of Creation. Three times, her plans came to naught. Mara's prestige within Malfeas remains undiminished despite these failures, for the tools of her ambition still abide in the world and much cautionary lore regarding them has vanished in the fires of cataclysm and revolt. The Black Claw style was her second plan, and while it failed, it has not passed from existence and might still bear fruit in this Age or the next.
   Also known variously as the Fainting Maiden style or the Mouse-Seizes-Bear Art, Black Claw style utilizes the tools of misdirection, perception and love as its primary weapons. Victory is grasped by opening oneself utterly to the aggressions of one's foe so that he castigates himself as thoroughly as his victim. Defeat is mollified by exposing the perfidy of the victorious.
    Black Claw style has two qualities that differentiate it from other Celestial Martial Arts. First, like all demon-created Celestial arts, any demon of any circle may practice the style so long as the spirit satisfies all relevant trait minimums. Second, Mara's association with perverse relationships bleeds into every Charm, inseparably binding sifu and student. It is impossible to know the secrets of this style without being exposed to the innermost heart of one's instructor, and impossible to understand that knowledge without accepting what is within that heart. So it is that every Black Claw practitioner bears an Intimacy of genuine and unbreakable love toward his teacher. No amount of natural persuasion or scenes spent working against this love can weaken the Intimacy. Only unnatural mental influence can sever the emotional connection, and even then, every scene in which the character invokes a Black Claw style Charm counts as a scene spent rebuilding the Intimacy.
   This style gained popularity in Creation during the First Deliberative Era of the Old Realm. Its practice, which began among several of Brigid's students, quickly flourished throughout the Solar and Lunar community. Its first Exalted practitioners viewed the style as a quaint and amusing demon-trap, its dangers easily seen and avoided so that its benefits could be enjoyed. However, as the art spread far and wide, it came to be regarded with unease - while conquered demons were of no threat to the Realm, the idea of a power bloc forming among young Solars bonded in love to a handful of mighty teachers (all the worse if those teachers were Lunars, or Sidereals!) was quite alarming. So it was that after a few short centuries Queen Merela outlawed the style and brutally suppressed its schools. Those without the personal or political power to ignore the law were bonded in Eclipse-sanctified oaths to forsake the practice of the style. Save for a handful of lovestruck outlaws, it fell from the history of Creation.
   The Black Claw style likewise proved disruptive to the regimented chaos of the Demon City. Because it allowed the weak to bond the mighty to themselves in chains of love, Cecelyne issued a partial proscription against the style, sanctioning its use only by citizens of Malfeas. Orabilis, who does not consider love to be a form of wisdom, tasked his soul Florivet with rooting out illegal schools within the Demon City. However, the Whim-of-the-Wind has rarely bothered looking since he became an adventurer. On the rare occasions when he uncovers demonic serfs making unauthorized use of the Black Claw, he defeats them in gaudy and spectacular public fights, but this happens less and less as time goes on. The public resentment against him after such battles makes Florivet sullen and unenthusiastic.
   Now, as the Reclamation begins, Black Claw style is experiencing a resurgence. Mara has already taken on several Green Sun Princes as students (and lovers), and it will not be long before they establish their first school in Creation.
   Weapons and Armor: Black Claw style may only be practiced with bare hands, and without armor. An appearance of martial readiness would undermine practitioners' posture of unjustly assaulted innocence.

        <description>Despite being cruelly assaulted, the martial artist clasps his opponent to him. Swallowing his rancor, he does nothing to escalate the fight - such virtue! This Charm allows the martial artist to add his Essence rating in dice to all attempts to establish, maintain or control a grapple. However, a clinch enhanced by this Charm may only be used to apply a hold, not to crush or throw.
   Incidentally, as a Crippling effect, the target the martial artist is holding automatically fails all Toxicity rolls, and any poisons in the target's system add the L tag to their Toxicity.</description>

        <description>The Black Claw practitioner is well aware that vulnerability is his greatest defense, and exploits it ruthlessly. The martial artist falls back hurriedly in response to an attack, his every movement accentuating his inferiority in the face of the oncoming assault. Realization of her target's weakness unnerves or unduly excites the attacker, depending on her temperament, causing her to experience an internal penalty on her attack roll equal to the martial artist's (Appearance + 2). This unnatural mental influence costs two Willpower to ignore. In the First Age, this technique was also sometimes known as the Fainting Maiden Ward, or the Painted Boy Defense.</description>

        <description>Only a coward would use a weapon to strike down an unarmed man. All Creation rejoices to see a bully given a dose of his own medicine, and the martial artist is the one to do it.
   This Charm is activated in response to an attack; regardless of whether the attack succeeds, the martial artist may launch a counterattack. This counterattack is a standard disarm attempt (see Exalted, p.158), save that rather than knocking the opponent's weapon away, the martial artist steals and reflexively equips it. If the counterattack succeeds, he may treat the pilfered weapon as though it were an unarmed attack for the purpose of all Black Claw style Charms then for the rest of the scene or until the weapon leaves his grasp, whichever comes first. Weapons made entirely of Essence and attuned artifact weapons are not valid targets for this Charm.
   Additionally, all characters who witness a successful disarm performed with this Charm treat the sight as a scene of work toward building a positive Intimacy for the martial artist. The emotional context of this Intimacy is chosen by the observer's player. This unnatural mental influence costs one Willpower to resist.</description>

        <description>These things are natural in Creation, but not Malfeas: To cheer for the underdog, to feel one's heart go out to another in pain, and to abhor injustice. Thus pious critics of Black Claw style are revealed as hypocrites; this technique employs the weapons of Creation, not Hell.
   This Charm may be activated in response to an attack that successfully strikes the martial artist. It takes the form of a kiai that compresses the character's agony into a heart-rending wail. Roll ([Manipulation or Appearance] + Performance), adding a number of successes equal to any wound penalties the martial artist may be suffering, and apply it against the Dodge MDV of all witnesses within earshot save for the attacker himself. Those who succumb to this unnatural mental influence (spending the standard one Willpower to resist immunizes a listener for the rest of the scene) suffer a Compulsion to assault the martial artist's attacker and to protect the martial artist. This behavior persists until either the attacker or the martial artist has been out of sight for one minute, or the scene ends, whichever comes first.
   The attack is considered automatically successful against all listeners who have a positive intimacy toward the martial artist, a negative intimacy toward the attacker, or who believe the attacker started the fight.</description>

However, the Whim-of-the-Wind has rarely bothered looking since he became an adventurer. On the rare occasions when he uncovers demonic serfs making unauthorized use of the Black Claw, he defeats them in gaudy and spectacular public fights, but this happens less and less as time goes on. The public resentment against him after such battles makes Florivet sullen and unenthusiastic.
   Now, as the Reclamation begins, Black Claw style is experiencing a resurgence. Mara has already taken on several Green Sun Princes as students (and lovers), and it will not be long before they establish their first school in Creation.
   Weapons and Armor: Black Claw style may only be practiced with bare hands, and without armor. An appearance of martial readiness would undermine practitioners' posture of unjustly assaulted innocence.
   Complementary Abilities: To properly grasp the insights upon which the style is founded, a student must possess at least two dots spread in any fashion among Larceny, Socialize and Performance.</description>

        <description>This is the secret final technique of the Black Claw style. In the past, many teachers kept this Charm to themselves. Though the Yozis have forbidden their progeny from withholding it from the Green Sun Princes, it seems likely that many of the style's Infernal masters may likewise neglect to mention Heart-Ripping Claw when they establish their schools in Creation.
    Eight wisdoms live at the heart of Black Claw style: Love is a lie; innocence is a lie; blame is a lie; lies are inescapable. Children betray their parents; gods betray their makers; students betray their teachers; betrayal is inescapable. Wise masters are ready to strike first, and strike better.
    Enhancing an unarmed attack with this Charm causes the attacking limb to be wreathed in a corona of screaming black shadows, razor-edged and lashing. An attack so enhanced inflicts lethal damage, and adds a raw damage bonus equal to twice the martial artist's Essence rating.
       Moreover, if the Black Claw master is held in someone's heart, he cannot fail to strike that mark. This Charm acts as an unblockable and undodgeable attack against any target harboring a positive Intimacy toward the martial artist. If the attack would have missed such a target without this Charm, then it strikes with a threshold of 0 successes. If the target has an Intimacy of love toward the martial artist, then the attack inflicts aggravated damage in addition to the benefits mentioned above. If this Charm slays an opponent, the Infernal tears the target's heart out of their chest and holds it in his fist as it crumbles to ash.</description>

        <description>Striking an Infernal Monster stylist makes him angry. This is unwise. Whenever the martial artist suffers one or more levels of damage, his player may activate this Charm. Doing so causes him to enter a savage killing frenzy for a scene like that imposed by an uncontrolled Berserk Anger Limit Break (Exalted, p. 105). The enraged character is immune to all negative effects from wound penalties (including dice penalties and slowing) and treats all forms of mental influence from beings of equal or lesser Essence as unacceptable orders. He regains no Willpower points from the rampage. Characters who have Limit tracks bleed off a single point of accrued Limit from this induced catharsis rather than resetting to zero, but this only happens once the character kills or horribly maims someone with an unarmed attack during the scene. Characters do not gain or require any conscious knowledge of the Great Curse to use this Charm.</description>

He adds his Martial Arts rating to the number of yards per tick he can cover with a Move or Dash action, provided he heads toward a character he observed physically attacking him this scene.

        <description>The Infernal's eyes close and his face assumes a curiously sad expression, as if he almost regrets the carnage about to follow. When they open, they burn vivid emerald and his muscles swell impossibly, increasing his overall size and mass by 10%. Style-compatible armor resizes with him, but most clothes tear unless very loose-fitting. Use of this Charm is compatible with Lunar tattoos. The martial artist gains the benefits listed below.
• Every unarmed attack inflicts piercing damage and grants the monster a cumulative dot of Strength for the scene. This dot does increase the damage of the attack that provided it. No combination of Charms including Infernal Monster Form can provide more than (Essence) additional dots, and this bonus is treated as a dice bonus from Charms. This Strength gain occurs even if the attack misses but only occurs once per attack regardless of the number of targets.
• He can parry lethal and ranged attacks unarmed without a stunt.
• He decreases the Speed of all unarmed attacks by -1, to a minimum of Speed 3, provided he attacks once rather than as part of a flurry.
• His body expands metaphysically as well as physically, causing him to exist outside of fate and as a creature of darkness native to Malfeas for the duration of the Charm. These states carry all the usual advantages and disadvantages. In addition to basic removal from fate, the character's presence imposes automatic failure on all thaumaturgical divination methods (such as astrology) used within a mile, causing them to return a single disturbing result: "The monster is here".</description>

        <description>The Infernal raises one or both arms and brings her fist(s) down like a hammer, driving a target into the ground. This Charm enhances an unarmed attack, causing the target to suffer automatic knockdown with no roll to resist if the attack hits. Additionally, every other character apart from the Charm user within (Martial Arts) yards of the impact must check for knockdown at a difficulty of (the Exalt's Essence).
   The surface beneath the target also suffers the raw damage of the attack, though this damage is always bashing and automatically piercing. Normally, Storytellers can dispense with calculating damage to the ground and simply assume this Charm leaves the target in a small crater. However, targets standing on flimsy structures may find their footing blasted out from under them, especially from high-damage attacks.
   If an Exalt uses this Charm to successfully strike a materialized god or demon with equal or lesser Essence, she may pay an additional Willpower. This strews the victim's body as splatters of ephemera and gobbets of divine flesh in the usual crater. Although it appears to witnesses that the spirit died - messily - it is no more harmed than normal from the attack, save for being forcibly returned to its natural dematerialized state in addition to being knocked prone.</description>

        <description>Those hurled away by the unholy might of an Infernal Monster's blows may count themselves fortunate. It is always possible they will land out of sight and not die, just as it is always possible that the monster will forget about them in favor of new prey. Such are the limits of their hope. Whenever the martial artist hits a target with a fierce blow (see Exalted, p. 158) enhanced with God-Smashing Blow, she may use any type of closed-fist striking technique instead of relying solely upon overhand hammer-fists. The opponent flies back in the direction of the blow, so the attacker may choose any remotely plausible vector.
   Fists of the Old Ones launches victims (Strength x 5) yards in the chosen direction. Upon landing or striking any barrier in the path of flight, the character suffers falling damage as if he had plummeted straight down by the distance he actually traversed before being interrupted. Unlike conventional falls, victims can't arrest their momentum with a (Wits + Athletics) roll, although they can mitigate damage by tumbling as normal. A successful roll also keeps characters blasted back into high barriers from bouncing off and falling again for a third round of damage from the attack. All of the usual effects of God-Smashing Blow go into effect at the victim's final destination point after any bounce. This Charm is subject to the normal limits of falling damage.</description>

Whenever the character has Retribution Will Follow and Infernal Monster Form simultaneously active, the cost to activate all Infernal Monster Style Charms and Infernal-only expansions to the style decreases by one mote (or two motes if the martial artist has Essence 6+ and knows One Hand Fury).

If the target is an animate being who is prone as of sequentially resolving the final attack in this cascade, the Infernal can make two additional attacks as part of the flurry, and these final attacks can't be dodged.</description>

            <description>Prior to his treachery, Gorol was among the foremost grandmasters of Solar Hero Style and one of the first to develop more custom Charms for that style. Following his surrender and enslavement to the Yozis, he returned to Creation armed with new Charms that mocked his former accomplishments and the noble purity of his former style. These obscene fighting techniques allowed him to best his circle once his crimes became known. If the natural fighting arts of the Lawgivers equip them to bravely strike down the mightiest devils with whatever lies at hand, then Infernal Monster Style exists to create monsters worthy of needing Solar Hero Style. Exalted who study this art learn to use their rage as a lens, focusing Essence toward acts of unthinkable brutality and savagery. There is nothing noble about this art except the refreshing simplicity with which it grinds enemies into sticky red paste.
   Infernal Monster Style is only compatible with armor created by Infernal Charms. Its form weapons are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, boot and all improvised weapons (see Exalted, p. 242), as well as artifact versions thereof. Despite this style's name, it is the "hero" style of the Infernal Exalted and is sometimes called Infernal Hero Style by those who view Creation's Exalted as worse monsters than themselves. Infernal-only expansions to this style are Ability-based Martial Arts Charms rather than Infernal Charms, extrapolating the themes and imagery of the Infernal Monster rather than expressing the esoteric powers of any particular Yozi. Both Green Sun Princes and akuma may access and develop new extensions. As normal, non-Infernals can learn the base Charms of this style as a formal Celestial art.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster holds its prey like a beast's chew toy, dragging it around effortlessly. This Charm enhances a grapple attack against an opponent light enough to drag around (see sidebar), substituting Martial Arts for Athletics for the feat of strength. The Exalt grapples using a single limb of his choice without any off-hand penalties. If the attack succeeds, he can only hold the opponent and may not break hold or crush with that attack. However, the grapple no longer requires any effort apart from tying up the non-reflexive use of the attacking limb. Consequently, the attacker may defend and fight as if carrying any other large weapon without the usual restrictions placed on grapplers, but he may not make further physical attacks against the foe in hand. He must still roll to maintain control each action, but this roll is reflexive for him, so he always applies his full dice pool regardless of whatever other actions he takes. The Charm immediately ends if the held opponent escapes or if the martial artist uses control of the grapple to do anything besides hold the enemy to continue the effect.
   The martial artist can use a held enemy as an improvised one-handed weapon to strike or parry (the restriction on parrying while grappling is lifted for this purpose) using the following statistics: Speed 6; Accuracy -3; Damage (Strength x 2)B + attack successes; Defense -3; Rate 2; Tags: P, R.
   Whenever a wielded character hits a target or blocks an attack, she suffers (the martial artist's Strength) dice of piercing damage from the impact. This damage is bashing unless the held character is used to block a lethal or aggravated attack. If this punishment kills a held victim, her corpse remains a useful weapon for the rest of the Charm's duration.</description>

        <description>The best defense is to break an enemy's will to fight. Gorol learned this the hardest possible way when he overheard the Neverborn whisper the Great Curse and sought to integrate the lesson into Infernal Monster Style. This Charm may defend against any perceived physical attack by changing the target from the martial artist to a victim she is holding with World-Breaker Grip. The attack is resolved as if the new target were its original target and cannot be aborted. If an attacker kills a held character toward whom she has a positive Intimacy as a result of this attack redirection, the attacker loses one Willpower from despair. A mortal who inadvertently kills a close loved one this way (such as a spouse or child) loses all remaining Willpower points as his will breaks along with his heart (see Exalted, p. 174).</description>

        <description>Masters of Infernal Monster Style gain a new and terrible form weapon. Purchase of this Charm permanently transforms one of the character's hands into a demonic artifact weapon. This change is explicitly compatible with Lunar tattoos. The hand doesn't have to look different, but many stylists consider it a mark of pride and deliberately choose for it to permanently assume some unnatural qualities such as disproportionate size or transmutation into black stone inlaid with brass, etc.
   The weapon permanently adds three bashing damage to the hand's punch and clinch statistics. Furthermore, the artifact is completely indestructible while the martial artist lives. If somehow amputated, the weapon disintegrates and the character regenerates the limb to full functionality after five days of healing. A regenerated limb and hand always show inhuman disfigurements of the player's choice. Acti-vating Infernal Monster Form or any Sidereal style Form automatically causes Old Realm characters to smolder into existence over the weapon's entire surface, narrating the Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden in runes ornamented with spiraling whorls of green flame (see sidebar). Leather gloves made from human or demon skin can hide this. These runes provide the following powers and drawbacks:
• The character's punch attacks have the following striking statistics in lieu of the basic damage bonus above: Speed 5, Accuracy (+Essence), Damage +(Essence + Willpower)B, Rate Infinite, Tags: N, P. The weapon's clinch stats are Speed 6, Accuracy +0, Damage +(Essence + Willpower)B, Rate 1, Tags: C, N, P. The weapon is considered in-form for all Sidereal styles in addition to Infernal Monster Style.
• If the character would gain a temporary dot of Strength from Infernal Monster Form and has already reached the maximum number of dots the Charm can bestow, she gains a cumulative +1 raw damage bonus to attacks using the hand instead. There is no limit on how high the bonus can go, save that it resets to zero when the character deactivates the Form (or the scene ends). Normal Charm limits on bonus dice caps do not apply.
• All social attacks by Yozis and Third Circle demons against the martial artist are undodgeable for one full day following any flaring of the runes. The character may argue against the Yozis or their core aspects (i.e., parry) but can't ignore or reject the nature of the weapon she has become. Worse, once in the lifetime of any Infernal Monster Style master, the Yozis may telepathically command her to act as they please for one scene across any distance or realms of existence. Resistance is not possible, and defenses that trump this control merely postpone it to another time. The character can be ordered to betray her Motivation but can't be given an unacceptable order. This effect is a closely guarded secret of the Yozis and remains unknown to their Infernal Exalted and the Fivescore Fellowship alike. If any individual masters suspect the danger or have discovered this curse the hard way, they have kept the knowledge to themselves. Anys Syn, elder aide to Chejop Kejak and chief architect of the Immaculate Dragon Styles, would personally prosecute any of the Maidens' Chosen found to be compromised in such a manner, her own predilection for wearing gloves to major battles notwithstanding.</description>
        <comment>Scripture of the One-Handed Maiden
   Once there was a maiden...
   ...who struck an iron wall until it shattered her hand.
   She did not stop, though cracks spread throughout her bones.
   She did not stop, though blood sprayed her eyes.
   She did not stop until she shattered the wall.
   "Survival is fury", she said.</comment>

        <description>Most enemies may be splattered in one hit. Fewer must be thrown back like juvenile fish to mature into worthy prey. Only the rarest of adversaries must be torn limb from limb, but Infernal Monsters dream of such opportunities and wake salivating. This Charm may only be activated as a particularly brutal means of releasing an opponent seized with World-Breaker Grip. The Infernal adjusts his grip to twist off the enemy's limbs the way a young boy might pull the wings off a fly. Mocking laughter is not required but is customary to the maneuver.
   The victim suffers a single level of unsoakable lethal damage and one crippling amputation injury of the Infernal's choice, examples of which may be found on page 152 of Exalted. If these options aren't brutal enough, the Infernal might rend an enemy's genitals, taking away his or her ability to enjoy sex or procreate and messily terminating any existing pregnancy in the process. Regardless, the severed organ remains in the Infernal's grip. In case it comes up, a dismembered human-sized limb may be used with the same statistics as a club as an in-style improvised weapon.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster will tear the sun from the sky. Until then, it flings screaming reminders of this doom into the heavens as unwilling heralds. As they tumble and spill their broken innards on the earth, so will molten orichalcum blood splatter the smoking crater of final twilight. This Charm may be activated whenever the character releases an enemy from a clinch by throwing her, provided the Infernal is capable of lifting that enemy's weight with a feat of strength. The Exalt hefts her up one-armed into the air and slams her with a thunderous punch from his other hand.
   The opponent flies up to (Martial Arts x 4) miles away over the course of approximately five minutes and plummets back to earth, impacting the land at terminal velocity to suffer the usual damage and inflict the same damage to the impacted surface (see Exalted, pp. 126-127). Everyone within (the Infernal's Strength x 10) yards of the impact point (including the Infernal) must check for knockdown at a difficulty of (the Infernal's Strength). Anyone blasted back by this Charm who is stopped prior to reaching maximum distance still suffers all effects of a terminal velocity impact. Lifted inanimate objects may also be hurled extreme distances with this Charm to the same overall effect.
       Lawgivers practice a Solar Hero Style expansion Charm named Horizon-Hurling Tactic that has Heaven Thunder Hammer as a prerequisite. Its required trait minimums and effects are otherwise identical.</description>

        <description>The Green Sun Prince may liberate others from their ill-considered promises, though doing so is not without price. Akuma cannot learn this Charm, for its nature is metaphysically antithetical to the vows that enslave them. Oath-Shattering Strike may only be activated after flaring the runes of One Hand Fury through an activation of Infernal Monster Style. The Exalt must also know the terms of the magical oath he intends to shatter, and that oath must have been sanctified by a being with an Essence no greater than the Infernal's own unmodified permanent rating.
   The Infernal strikes the target who swore the oath with an unarmed blow. Runes of power explode around the target, depicting the terms and authority of the oath in the moments before they dissolve into emerald fire and sand. The target is freed from the oath, but the burden for breaking it falls upon the Infernal in full as if he had sworn and deliberately broken the vow. Whether this Charm is powerful enough to fulfill its ultimate purpose remains to be seen, as no Green Sun Princes with Essence 10 exist to test it against the promises the Unconquered Sun exacted from his defeated masters.</description>

            <description>Prior to his treachery, Gorol was among the foremost grandmasters of Solar Hero Style and one of the first to develop more custom Charms for that style. Following his surrender and enslavement to the Yozis, he returned to Creation armed with new Charms that mocked his former accomplishments and the noble purity of his former style. These obscene fighting techniques allowed him to best his circle once his crimes became known. If the natural fighting arts of the Lawgivers equip them to bravely strike down the mightiest devils with whatever lies at hand, then Infernal Monster Style exists to create monsters worthy of needing Solar Hero Style. Exalted who study this art learn to use their rage as a lens, focusing Essence toward acts of unthinkable brutality and savagery. There is nothing noble about this art except the refreshing simplicity with which it grinds enemies into sticky red paste.
   Infernal Monster Style is only compatible with armor created by Infernal Charms. Its form weapons are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, boot and all improvised weapons (see Exalted, p. 242), as well as artifact versions thereof. Despite this style's name, it is the "hero" style of the Infernal Exalted and is sometimes called Infernal Hero Style by those who view Creation's Exalted as worse monsters than themselves. Infernal-only expansions to this style are Ability-based Martial Arts Charms rather than Infernal Charms, extrapolating the themes and imagery of the Infernal Monster rather than expressing the esoteric powers of any particular Yozi. Both Green Sun Princes and akuma may access and develop new extensions. As normal, non-Infernals can learn the base Charms of this style as a formal Celestial art.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster charges toward enemies. They are prey, not threats. Exalted with this Charm can activate Raging Behemoth Charge as an innate power rather than a Charm activation while using Retribution Will Follow or Infernal Monster Form. While using Raging Behemoth Charge, the Infernal also gains the following additional benefits:
• He cannot become fatigued from exertion. Any fatigue penalties suffered at the time of activation are suspended until the Charm ends, resuming as though no time had passed.
• He can run through muck, climb and swim toward valid opponents at the same speed as ground movement (rather than half).
• When moving toward a valid opponent, the Infernal's actions aren't capped by Athletics over unstable footing or swimming in rough conditions. He effectively has whatever Athletics he needs to ignore such complications.</description>

        <description>Fleeing the Infernal Monster is an exercise in futility. This Charm enhances an unarmed attack (which can be an unarmed attempt to initiate a grapple), allowing the Infernal to reflexively jump toward the target before determining whether the target is in range for the purposes of resolving the attack. If he reaches his target, the attack resolves normally with a +2 bonus to its raw damage from added momentum. Otherwise, the jump moves the Infernal the appropriate distance but the attack automatically misses. Leaping Smash Technique can be activated as an innate power rather than a Charm activation if the Exalt has Raging Behemoth Charge or Infernal Monster Form active. Essence 2-3 Exalted can only use this Charm to enhance the first attack in a flurry; those with greater Essence surpass the limitation and can flurry to bound across the battlefield.
   If Leaping Smash Technique is used in conjunction with God-Smashing Blow to enhance an attack, the final jump distance is doubled after applying any modifiers from Bounding Beast Advance.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster shouldn't be fast enough to strike as it does. Nothing that strong should be so fast. It's just not fair. This Charm permanently improves its prerequisite. The Infernal can pay an additional four motes when using Leaping Smash Technique to impose a DV penalty against the attack. If the target attempts to parry, the penalty is equal to the Exalt's Martial Arts rating. Dodges (and any combination of dodge and parry) only suffer a penalty of half the Infernal's Martial Arts. Although adding this penalty does not make the attack unexpected, defenses that convert an an unexpected attack into an expected attack also negate the penalty.
   If the Infernal has Essence 4+, the DV penalty to dodge increases to the Exalt's full Martial Arts.</description>

        <description>It is difficult to run fast enough or far enough to escape the Infernal Monster. Yet they always try. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite. Whenever the Infernal uses Leaping Smash Technique, if the target is aware of the Exalt's location and is moving away from him, the Exalt multiplies the maximum final jump distance by his (Martial Arts) after applying any modifiers from Bounding Beast Advance. If the Leaping Smash Technique is performed in conjunction with God-Smashing Blow, the distance modifier is doubled again, so (Martial Arts x 2). This is a special exception on how multiplicative effects usually stack in Exalted. Characters who have an Intimacy of fear toward the Infernal are always considered moving away from him for the purposes of this Charm.</description>

        <description>The Infernal finds those who flee her. Whenever an Infernal with this Charm uses Leaping Smash Technique to attack an individual, he can place a Sorcerous tag on that individual for one hour. The brief arcane link of sublime aggression connects the Infernal Monster with her intended quarry. It is possible to tag any number of separate victims with separate attacks, but Infernals can't tag and have no need to tag the same victim more than once.
   Whenever the Infernal Monster uses Leaping Smash Technique while he has tagged one or more victims, he can choose one of those enemies as the attack's target and allow the arcane link to guide her. Her instinct-driven leap carries her in the direction of her quarry, regardless of whether she is aware of the victim's current location. If an unobstructed path to that target exists and the target is in range of the leap, the attack resolves as normal for use of Leaping Smash Technique. An invisible opponent (or a dematerialized one) still applies a -2 external penalty to the attack roll. If the opponent is out of reach or protected by total cover, the leap carries the Infernal the maximum possible distance toward her without slamming her into intervening obstacles (unless she chooses to slam through them because she has other magic enabling her to do so). With the right Charms, it is possible to use Nowhere to Hide to leap through a wall and resolve the attack against someone on the other side.
       Martial Arts 5+ allows the Infernal to leap toward the closest god or demon bigger than a least god or Thing That Lurks In Corners that he can reach with the attack (as though that being were tagged). He can exclude any potential targets he can perceive to avoid attacking allies (even while in a berserk state). This doesn't let him hit dematerialized beings, but in conjunction with magic that does, he can use an attack as a means of testing if there are any spirits snooping about.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster follows the scent of blood, whether that is blood he has drawn or the blood on the hands of those who wounded him. This Charm may be activated to Sorcerously tag any living victim the Infernal inflicted actual levels of damage on with an unarmed attack in the past hour. Alternately, Blood Heralds Death can tag enemies who inflicted actual levels of damage to the Exalt in the past hour as a direct result of their actions (even unintentional injury). Either way, the tag forges an arcane link duplicating that placed by Nowhere to Hide (to the point that it can be used to tag characters in order to leap after them when they are close by). Unlike its prerequisite. Blood Heralds Death places tags that last a week rather than an hour. If the tag is removed via countermagic, the Infernal requires new injuries to re-tag that character with another activation.
   Whenever an Infernal makes a tracking roll to pursue a victim tagged by this Charm, that roll is enhanced as though by the Solar Charm Unshakeable Bloodhound Technique (Exalted, p. 211). However, the Infernal receives no bonus to the roll-off if another effect contests the tracking effort. With Essence 4+, the Infernal becomes immune to all fatigue accrued while actively tracking a tagged target. Sleep deprivation affects him normally, but he can give endless chase without tiring from exertion. Existing fatigue is also ignored while tracking tagged victims, but resumes as soon as he stops as though no time passed.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster does not understand forgiveness. This Charm improves its prerequisite, allowing tags it places to last until the Exalt dies, the target dies or the tag is removed via countermagic (i.e. duration becomes indefinite rather than one month).
   With Essence 6+, the Infernal's enmity is the stuff of terrible legend. If the target dies, the tag is inherited by the oldest surviving blood offspring of that person. If there is no child to inherit the tag, it passes to the victim's oldest surviving sibling. If there is not a sibling to carry on the family curse, the vendetta dies there. The Infernal intuitively knows when a transfer occurs and the relationship between the tag's last bearer and its new heir.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster haunts his enemies. They see his rage-contorted face when they sleep. They feel his hot breath upon the back of their neck. They know he is coming for them. Upon activating this Charm, the Infernal's eyes glaze over as though from a distracting daydream. A small smile curls at the corner of his lips. He is completely unaware of his environment and unable to take physical actions in this fugue state, but remains upright if standing. The trance lasts for the Charm's full duration, but his player may choose for him to reflexively snap out of it and end the Charm in order to react to stimuli (like an incoming attack). It is also possible to activate Armageddon Nightmare Duel while the Infernal is unconscious, focusing his dreams on distant prey.
   This Charm is not studied as an idle distraction to avoid boredom. At the time of activation, the Infernal chooses an enemy he has tagged with Blood Heralds Death. If that enemy is awake, he knows this and activating the Charm costs him nothing. The tagged character momentarily hallucinates and imagines he sees the Infernal somewhere nearby, but his senses catch up a split second later to reveal he's just jumping at shadows. The delusion is unsettling, but too fleeting to have any mechanical impact.
   If the tagged enemy is sleeping when Armageddon Nightmare Duel activates, paying fifteen motes and one Willpower allows the Infernal to meet the victim in a shared nightmare created by the Charm. Sleep means real sleep, not an alternative activity that counts as sleep for the target due to magic. This nightmare's terrain can contain any landscapes and environments natural to Creation and is arbitrarily vast, effectively an infinite plain on which to impose features as they are discovered. The Infernal and the victim are the only two beings in this world. Sessile life-forms like plants and fungi are permissible, as these qualify as scenery rather than actors in the psychodrama.
   The two enter the dream in sight of one another, but no closer than one hundred yards. Neither can be placed in a starting position that is actively injurious to him, though targets immune to particular environmental hazards may begin exposed to such conditions. Inability to see or use similarly-acute senses is a special hazard for this purpose. The Infernal becomes aware of such immunities in the instant he activates the Charm so that he can set the stage appropriately. Storytellers should ensure that this rule is followed in spirit as well as letter. Placing an enemy on a tiny pedestal over a vast sea of lava with no way to move or escape without suffering burning horrid death is not technically a violation of the rule. Neither is placing a strong-but-slow enemy who can't see in the dark in pitch-black frozen cave so slick its floor can't be walked on without supernatural balance or astounding agility. Both scenarios are completely against the spirit of the Charm. Dangerous environments are permissible, but using them as weapons should require work and there should always be some means of avoiding the danger.
   When the dream begins, the Infernal has full motes, Willpower, Virtue channels and health. He can choose not to carry over any lingering negative effects currently afflicting him into his dream self. In effect, his nightmare form is himself at full power, but with no Charms that require activations active. The victim enters the dream as she is in real life, but with no Charms active. If she is wounded or supernaturally beguiled or mutated into a three-armed freak outside the dream, she remains so within the dream. Both characters immediately join battle. Time flows in the dream at the same rate as reality, so the dream cannot actually take or appear to take longer than (the Infernal's Martial Arts) minutes.
   Nothing that happens to the Infernal in the dream has any bearing on his actual self. If he dies or falls unconscious within the dream, the Charm ends and the dream ends for both parties. This also severs the sorcerous tag connecting the Infernal to that victim like countermagic. The victim has much more at stake. Any motes spent in the dream are lost to no real effect, though Exalted victims consider all dream-spent motes Peripheral as they subconsciously flare their animas. All Willpower and Virtue channels spent are actually spent. All mental influence imposed in the dream carries over to reality for its full duration. No physical harm carries over, but if the victim is killed in the dream, the Charm ends for both parties without breaking the tag.
   Dying inside the dream feels like actually dying, so the experience drains five additional Willpower points from the victim and counts as a scene spent building an Intimacy of fear toward the Infernal. If this results in the Intimacy actually taking root or bolstering an existing Intimacy of fear, nothing can remove it until a week has gone by since the victim awoke from the dream. Beings with a Limit track can gain equivalent points of Limit in lieu of losing any of the Willpower. Victims can choose to quickly commit suicide within the nightmare to escape it with minimal loss, but doing so causes the Intimacy of fear to form immediately rather counting as a scene toward it.
   If the victim's real body suffers any levels of damage during the dream, the Charm abruptly ends for both parties. This also happens if the Charm runs its full duration without being interrupted. Both dreamers leave the dream with the Infernal no worse for the wear and the victim depleted by her exertions within the dreamscape. The tag remains, but the dream does not hurt the victim's psyche like virtual death.
       Victims of Armageddon Nightmare Duel leave the nightmare acutely aware of the Infernal Monster Style Charms the Exalt displayed. Those who are capable of learning Celestial Martial Arts from a teacher can instruct themselves in any of the Charms they observed as though the Infernal was their teacher. Obviously, only other Infernals can learn Infernal Monster expansions this way without an effect like the Eclipse anima power. Characters requiring a special initiation before they can learn Celestial Martial Arts (like Dragon-Blooded) cannot learn Charms from exposure to Armageddon Nightmare Duel until they undergo that initiation.
       Players who purchase this Charm for their characters are expected to use it to create additional interesting scenes, not steal the spotlight. It is poor form to hold a game hostage to play out a personal fight. If the outcome isn't really in doubt and the both dreamers' players consent, a quick narrative of the one-sided brawl suffices in lieu of devoting an entire scene to the duel. Standing and fighting the Infernal in quick narration rather than jumping off a cliff may be equally futile, but at least the Intimacy of fear forms less quickly.</description>

Whenever the Infernal kills a non-extra victim of Armageddon Nightmare Duel with an unarmed attack within the dreamscape, she regains two points of Willpower.

If the Infernal kills an enemy with an unarmed attack outside of the nightmare that she has previously killed in a nightmare, she regains three Willpower points.</description>

Second, the Infernal can invoke Retribution Will Follow as an innate power rather than a Charm activation.
   Smoldering Rage Beast carries a steep price. The Exalt must activate Retribution Will Follow whenever confronted with an opportunity to do so unless he pays one Willpower to resist (immunizing him against other Rage effects for a day as normal).</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster is a being of singular madness and violent purpose. He refuses to be conflicted in his urges. This Charm is a permanent modification of the Infernal's capabilities. Whenever he hits Limit 10 and would enter a bout of Limit Break or Torment, he can allow the usual madness or suffering to take place. Alternately, he can choose to frenzy with benefits and drawbacks identical to an uncontrolled Berserk Anger Limit Break (Exalted, p. 105). He regains (Martial Arts rating) Willpower points from entering this rampage and is considered to have Retribution Will Follow active for all Infernal Monster Style Charms that have effects based on using that Charm. He can also choose to heal instead of regaining Willpower from going berserk, regenerating any of the following damage options: one level of aggravated, two levels of lethal or four levels of bashing.
   With Essence 5+, the Infernal radiates his madness in a radius of (Martial Arts x 10) yards. Any being that hits Limit 10 within that radius has the option to frenzy like the Exalt. Such beings can only regain Willpower and may not heal by going berserk.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster is dauntlessly fierce. This Charm is a permanent enhancement of the Infernal's capabilities that applies if he has Valor 3+. While using Retribution Will Follow or Infernal Monster Form, he adds his Martial Arts rating in bonus successes to all Valor rolls to resist fear and adds this same amount directly to his Valor rating to defend against effects resisted better with a higher rating. He also treats all Emotion effects solely based on instilling fear as unacceptable orders. This does not improve the effectiveness of Valor channels. Finally, he confers this same fearlessness to all Valor 3+ victims driven berserk by his Rage Charms.
   Infernals with this Charm can choose to reflexively improve it at any time, making themselves permanently fearless even when not using Retribution Will Follow or Infernal Monster Form. The catch is that their "sane" resting state becomes identical to a partially-controlled Foolhardy Contempt Limit Break (Exalted, p. 105). Going berserk obviously trumps this behavior, as does Limit Break or behavior-altering Torment. However, when the acute madness ends, the pervasive madness of a mind without fear returns. Once the Infernal embraces a life without fear, he cannot go back to using the Charm as he first learned it. He can only explore deeper into the madness of the Infernal Monster, trading fearlessness for something worse.</description>

        <description>The rage of the Infernal Monster is not just a shield against mental trickery and domination. Anger frees the mind. This Charm permanently enhances its prerequisite. Whenever the Infernal activates Retribution Will Follow, he can pay one aggravated health level and gain two Limit in addition to committing the usual mote. Doing so terminates all unnatural mental influence effects currently affecting his mind unless these effects meet one of the following criteria: the influence was self-imposed, the influence was caused by a being with a higher Essence rating than the Infernal's Martial Arts at the time it was imposed or the influence functions by making the Infernal angry or taking advantage of his fury to make him perform specific anger-driven behavior. Use of Retribution Will Follow this way can reduce Limit by slaughtering or maiming, reducing the net increase to one point rather than two. When the killing rage passes, shattered mental influence effects do not return.
   A secondary benefit of Fury is Freedom is that no mental influence can prevent the Exalt from activating Retribution Will Follow. It does not matter whether Fury Is Freedom can break the influence in question; nothing can prevent the Infernal from frenzying when he encounters the appropriate stimuli enabling activation of Retribution Will Follow.</description>

        <description>The Infernal Monster has no worries or guilt. Absolute violence yields absolute freedom. This Charm is a permanent modification to the Infernal Exalt's psyche and soul, scarring her with empowering madness. Green Sun Princes can't be compelled to learn Untamed Apocalypse Shintai with any mental influence; they must truly wish to embrace its transcendent damnation. Akuma have no say in the matter; their patrons decide whether to devolve their slaves into beasts of war. Untamed Apocalypse Shintai makes characters largely unplayable, so Storytellers should probably restrict it to antagonists. Learning the Charm changes the Infernal in the following ways:
• He lives in a constant state of fury like an uncontrolled Berserk Anger Limit Break (Exalted, p. 105). However, he is not compelled to wreck the environment in this resting state, just slaughter everything that moves. Furthermore, when he becomes fatigued or sleepy, he can end his rampage to seek a good place to rest. He will still attack anything that tries to prevent him from finding a lair, but will not pursue such opponents if they withdraw and let him resume his search. Living a berserk existence does not reduce the character's mental attributes or force him to fight incompetently. However, he won't take preparatory actions longer than a single miscellaneous action, so he can draw a weapon, but won't have the patience to strap into a warstrider.
• Activating Retribution Will Follow brings on a scene of unrestrained rage with a number of benefits (wound penalty reduction, mental influence resistance, etc.). His resting rage does not provide these benefits. The frenzy brought on by Retribution Will Follow, Limit Break and behavior-altering Torment all take precedence over the Infernal's mind and displace his constant fury for as long as they last.
• Infernal Monster Style and its expansions only cost the Infernal four experience points per Charm. This discount applies retroactively, awarding the difference in experience the Infernal is owed. Should the character somehow lose this Charm, he must pay that difference back. In the unlikely event a Storyteller lets a player take Untamed Apocalypse Shintai at character creation, the Infernal gains two Infernal Monster Style Charms for every starting Charm allocated to them and can buy more for two bonus points each. Untamed Apocalypse Shintai is not a precedent for Charms that provide dramatic cost reductions to acquire Solar-level Charms unless those Charms wreck the character permanently and absolutely. Not all paths of transcendence are desirable.
• The Exalt can raise his traits up as high as 10 without regard for the usual age-cap. His constant bestial fury sharply limits the kinds of Charms he can use, but he shatters through the limits that govern most Essence users. If he somehow loses this Charm, he converts all dots in excess of his permitted age cap back into experience. Learning this Charm precludes metamorphosis into a Primordial. The Infernal cannot learn the Charms that initiate this apotheosis.</description>

        <description>The Infernal screams his fury, and the armies who have faced him remember his wrath. The thunderous bellow can be heard for a mile. Within that radius, the scream affects all organized Magnitude 3+ military units that engaged with the Infernal in the past day in mass combat while he fought as a solo unit. Even units not currently engaged in battle are affected, provided they are camped or marching together and clearly operating as a group.
   The Infernal's player rolls Charisma + Martial Arts, adding a number of bonus successes equal to his Valor. Any affected unit led by a character with a Dodge MDV less than the number of successes rolled suffers an unnatural Emotion effect that imposes a -1 penalty to its Drill and Morale ratings as an unnatural Emotion effect. Units with perfect Morale are immune. Gaining perfect Morale terminates ongoing applications of the Charm affecting the unit. Leaders can pay two points of their own Willpower to rally the unit in hopes of reversing this damage; if the rally succeeds, the penalty is removed. Multiple roars stack their penalty, each of which requires a separate Willpower-fueled rally to remove.
   With Essence 4+, the roar carries out to a radius of (Limit + 1) miles. The radius at which the roar may be heard by everyone does not improve with Essence 5+, but magic carries the sound to the ears of all valid targets in the same realm of existence. Affected units hear the magic-born cry as a faint and distant sound, clearly made by something far away-but not nearly far enough.</description>

The Willpower cost for Essence 1 leaders to rally away the effects of Post-Traumatic Brutality Roar is four Willpower rather than two.
   With Essence 5+, this resistance cost increase also applies against unit leaders who are First Circle demons, Essence 1-3 UnExalted living Essence users (like Dragon-Kings and Mountain Folk), Essence 1-3 Fair Folk, Essence 1-3 gods, Essence 1-4 elementals and Essence 1-5 ghosts. Infernals who reach Essence 8+ extend the benefit against all Essence 1-5 unit leaders who are not Exalted.</description>

        <description>Soldiers train to fight other soldiers, not Things That Must Not Be. This Charm permanently improves its prerequisite. By spending an additional Willpower to activate Post-Traumatic Brutality Roar, the scream also induces a rout check in all units successfully penalized by it. This check is made at a +2 difficulty modifier.
   With Essence 6-7, the rout difficulty modifier rises to +3. It jumps to +4 at Essence 8-10.</description>

            <description>Prior to his treachery, Gorol was among the foremost grandmasters of Solar Hero Style and one of the first to develop more custom Charms for that style. Following his surrender and enslavement to the Yozis, he returned to Creation armed with new Charms that mocked his former accomplishments and the noble purity of his former style. These obscene fighting techniques allowed him to best his circle once his crimes became known. If the natural fighting arts of the Lawgivers equip them to bravely strike down the mightiest devils with whatever lies at hand, then Infernal Monster Style exists to create monsters worthy of needing Solar Hero Style. Exalted who study this art learn to use their rage as a lens, focusing Essence toward acts of unthinkable brutality and savagery. There is nothing noble about this art except the refreshing simplicity with which it grinds enemies into sticky red paste.
   Infernal Monster Style is only compatible with armor created by Infernal Charms. Its form weapons are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, boot and all improvised weapons (see Exalted, p. 242), as well as artifact versions thereof. Despite this style's name, it is the "hero" style of the Infernal Exalted and is sometimes called Infernal Hero Style by those who view Creation's Exalted as worse monsters than themselves. Infernal-only expansions to this style are Ability-based Martial Arts Charms rather than Infernal Charms, extrapolating the themes and imagery of the Infernal Monster rather than expressing the esoteric powers of any particular Yozi. Both Green Sun Princes and akuma may access and develop new extensions. As normal, non-Infernals can learn the base Charms of this style as a formal Celestial art.</description>

        <description>When the outcome is a given, trauma precedes horror. Those who stand in the presence of the Infernal Monster know this. This Charm permanently improves its prerequisite. By spending an additional Willpower to activate Post-Traumatic Brutality Roar, the cry penalizes all military units within a mile (whether or not they have engaged with the Infernal in the past day).
   With Essence 5+, using Fear of Foretold Fury affects all units in full earshot distance (Limit +1 miles). The trauma also magically carries to all units in the same realm of existence who have ever engaged with the Infernal as a solo unit, provided they retained consistent unit identity and leadership since that battle. The Storyteller determines if a unit has undergone sufficient turnover or shift in identity that it no longer recalls the horror of that fight. Gradual replacement of the rank-and-file does not erode the impact of the experience. Grizzled veterans pass along the whispered horror stories to wide-eyed recruits. Some refuse to talk about That Day at all. They just scowl and drink and look nervously behind them. A unit leader can address the lingering damage from the experience by taking the time to reassure the ranks and inspire them. This convalescence extends the time required to perform a restorative rally to a dramatic action lasting one week (ten hours a day); the leader must pay five Willpower to make the roll at the end. If the rally succeeds, the unit is no longer scarred and can't be affected outside of the (Limit +1 mile) radius until they have another actual battle with the Infernal.</description>

        <description>It must not be forgotten that the inventor of Infernal Monster Style was a Solar akuma. Gorol was an abomination to his circle mates, a living rejection of everything he stood for. In forsaking any claim to heroism, the akuma made himself the perfect monster. Unthinkable Shining Horror is exclusively Native to Solar akuma and can't be learned by other beings. The Charm upgrades Infernal Monster Form, providing the following additional powers:
• The akuma is not obligated to attack his Yozi master or any of its component Third Circle demons while in a berserk state (such as that induced by Retribution Will Follow) unless said entities physically attacked him earlier in the scene.
• The fallen Solar shocks those who love him, giving him a chance to slaughter them in their moment of hesitation. Characters with a positive Intimacy toward the akuma suffer an internal penalty of (the akuma's Essence) to all physical attacks targeting him. Resisting this unnatural Emotion effect for a scene costs five Willpower. Characters must have had the Intimacy for a minimum of one month to invoke the penalty. The horror afflicts loved ones, not awed strangers.
• If the Exalt knows Solar Hero Form, he may activate it simultaneously with Infernal Monster Form, paying the full cost of both Charms. The joint activation uses the highest Speed and DV penalty for both Charms and allows them to co-exist.
• As an optional Blasphemy effect, the Solar akuma may shove aside the limitations of his Charms, raising his bonus dice cap to (Attribute + Ability + Essence) while enhancing unarmed attacks and parries. This power is optional and can be used at any point, but once reflexively invoked, it lasts until Infernal Monster Form ends.</description>

        <description>Lunar akuma are among the most savage weapons the Yozi's command. It is not much of a leap from fury to rage or anger to madness. Moon-Beast Monster is only Native to Lunar akuma and may not be learned by other types of Infernals. The Charm provides the following effects:
• The akuma is not obligated to attack his Yozi master or any of its component Third Circle demons while in a berserk state (such as that induced by Retribution Will Follow) unless said entities physically attacked him earlier in the scene.
• Whenever the akuma activates Relentless Lunar Fury, he can simultaneously activate Retribution Will Follow as an innate power rather than a Charm activation. This still requires the usual commitment, but the use of Relentless Lunar Fury takes the place of suffering damage as a trigger condition.
• Infernal Monster Form gains the Gift keyword. Whenever the akuma shifts into war form, he may commit the usual cost to activate Infernal Monster Form. Used this way, the Form Charm remains active for as long as the Lunar remains in war form. This does not alter the way Infernal Monster Form accumulates its Strength bonus, so it still resets to zero at the end of each scene even if the Charm remains active.
• Armor created with Lunar Charms counts as armor created with Infernal Charms for the purposes of compatibility with Infernal Monster Style.</description>

        <description>Sidereal akuma can expand Infernal Monster Style, but this is a dubious honor for those who already aspire to the Blossom of the Perfected Lotus. Fallen Star Fury is exclusively Native to Sidereal akuma and can't be learned by other beings. By purchasing the Charm, the akuma rejoins fate on his own hideous terms. His unholy power grabs the strands of causality and tangles them around his fingers. He is still considered outside of fate for any effect in which being removed is an asset, but can connect to the Loom to use astrology or otherwise benefit from being inside fate. In effect, he is between fate rather than fully outside it, perversely enjoying the best of both worlds. The Storyteller adjudicates which state is preferable with regard to resolving all effects that depend on whether the akuma is part of Fate. Additionally, the akuma is not obligated to attack his Yozi master or any of its component Third Circle demons while in a berserk state (such as that induced by Retribution Will Follow) unless said entities physically attacked him earlier in the scene.
   With Essence 5+, the Charm gains the following additional powers, the last of which only helps masters of Infernal Monster Style:
• Infernal Monster Form does not interfere with the use of Sidereal Martial Arts Form-Type Charms. For example, she can have Infernal Monster Form and Citrine Poxes of Contagion Form active at the same time. If another effect allows him to use a limited number of Sidereal Form-Type Charms concurrently (like Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form), Infernal Monster Form does not count toward this limit. The akuma cannot generally use this power to stack Infernal Monster Form alongside other non-Sidereal Form-Type Charms. This can be enabled with Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form (or similar effects) by including lesser Forms within that Sidereal Form Charm and then stacking this with Infernal Monster Form.
• If employing the previous power to wield two Form-Type Charms, then all form weapons of either style are considered form weapons for both styles. This does not apply if the styles use different range weapons. Infernal Monster cannot be practiced with a bow any more than a bow-themed style could use improvised weapons.
• The corrupt Vizier can activate Infernal Monster Form at the same time as he activates a Sidereal Martial Arts Form-Type Charm, paying the usual cost to activate each Charm. This combined activation uses the highest Speed and DV penalty among both Form-Type Charms.
• If the akuma flares his One Hand Fury with a Sidereal Martial Arts Form-Type Charm, the burning runes spiral and twine from his hand and trail behind his blows like ribbons of smoldering emerald flame. This Obvious display provides the same benefits as the best sutra the akuma can use with that Sidereal Martial Art, but at no cost and without any chance of external disruption. For instance, if the akuma can only use a student sutra, then flaring his hand with a Sidereal form duplicates a student sutra.</description>

            <description>Long before there were Green Sun Princes, akuma explored the hideous potential of Infernal Monster Style. In so doing, they formulated four special Charms unique to each Exalted akuma type. These Charms are the only demonstrated examples of akuma-specific expansions, though it is possible that other such techniques exist as secret weapons for the day the Yozis unleash their beasts of war upon Creation.</description>

        <description>Terrestrial akuma achieve greatness their former peers cannot imagine. Through Infernal Monster Style, fallen Dragon-Blooded become incarnate natural disasters. Dragon-Spawned Demon-Monster is solely Native to Terrestrial akuma and can't be learned by other beings. It provides the following benefits:
• The akuma is not obligated to attack his Yozi master or any of its component Third Circle demons while in a berserk state (such as that induced by Retribution Will Follow) unless said entities physically attacked him earlier in the scene.
• Weapons of elemental energy created by Terrestrial Charms are considered form weapons for Infernal Monster Style (e.g. Refining the Inner Blade). If such Charms have the Holy keyword, they permanently lose their special benefits against creatures of darkness and cease to be Holy. If this results in a Charm that doesn't make sense, the Storyteller should exclude that Charm from conversion.
• Instant-duration Terrestrial Charms that damage targets through direct exposure to elemental energy are also considered form weapons for Infernal Monster Style (e.g. Elemental Bolt Attack). If such Charms are Holy, they are converted as previously explained. The akuma may also choose for such attacks to emerge from his mouth like the breath of a dragon.</description>

            <description>Prior to his treachery, Gorol was among the foremost grandmasters of Solar Hero Style and one of the first to develop more custom Charms for that style. Following his surrender and enslavement to the Yozis, he returned to Creation armed with new Charms that mocked his former accomplishments and the noble purity of his former style. These obscene fighting techniques allowed him to best his circle once his crimes became known. If the natural fighting arts of the Lawgivers equip them to bravely strike down the mightiest devils with whatever lies at hand, then Infernal Monster Style exists to create monsters worthy of needing Solar Hero Style. Exalted who study this art learn to use their rage as a lens, focusing Essence toward acts of unthinkable brutality and savagery. There is nothing noble about this art except the refreshing simplicity with which it grinds enemies into sticky red paste.
   Infernal Monster Style is only compatible with armor created by Infernal Charms. Its form weapons are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, boot and all improvised weapons (see Exalted, p. 242), as well as artifact versions thereof. Despite this style's name, it is the "hero" style of the Infernal Exalted and is sometimes called Infernal Hero Style by those who view Creation's Exalted as worse monsters than themselves. Infernal-only expansions to this style are Ability-based Martial Arts Charms rather than Infernal Charms, extrapolating the themes and imagery of the Infernal Monster rather than expressing the esoteric powers of any particular Yozi. Both Green Sun Princes and akuma may access and develop new extensions. As normal, non-Infernals can learn the base Charms of this style as a formal Celestial art.</description>

        <description>This Charm upgrades its prerequisite. If the Exalt has an Overdrive pool, offensive motes in this pool are not lost upon scene change to enter the arena of nightmare: the Infernal Monster enters the dreamscape with his full offensive might intact. Furthermore, this Charm generates fictitious shades of the victim's positive Intimacies all across the dream world. These characters are completely oblivious to the circumstances surrounding their arrival in the dream world, and will perfectly ignore any magical attempts to persuade or influence their behavior.
   The dreamscapes will patch themselves around these characters, creating scenes which are intimate to the victim. The victim might find himself wandering down a dark tunnel full of jagged rocks only to emerge into the kitchen of his long dead mother, who will appear to be alive, well, and busily preparing his breakfast. These representations of the victim's Intimacies are not hollow illusions to be laughed off or ignored. Even though the victim knows they cannot possibly be real, each has all the seeming of the people he most loves. They are, in fact, externally generated from within his heart, so he is completely unable to ignore the urge to protect or defend these characters unless he pays a point of Willpower to ignore the Infernal's unnatural Illusion, separately and for each Intimacy that he wishes to abandon. However, doing so in the dream also revokes this Intimacy from his heart when the nightmare ends.
   Needless to say, the presence of these Intimacies leaves the victim vulnerable. Unlike the real figures they represent, they do not possess the combat traits or magical powers they may actually possess in real life. They will act in a manner befitting their motivations, but will interact with the horrific, external presence of nightmarish dreamscapes and the presence of a monster only if directly confronted with evidence of these things. Otherwise, mom will ignore a victim who is being beaten to death in the adjacent cave; as in nightmare, the figments of the dreamer's heart seem only to exist in the small, familiar scenes in which they are placed within the dream.
   Of course, letting them off the hook would be too easy. If directly confronted by the Infernal Monster, they will attempt to flee or fight as accurate to their nature. However, having no actual traits or magic, each victim represents no greater threat status to the Infernal Monster than an extra. Killing a target's Intimacies while forcing him to watch grants the Infernal Monster (Essence) motes to his Overdrive pool, if he has one. Each slaughtered Intimacy also redefines itself with a context of tortured guilt when the dreamer awakens. As a final piece of advice, Gorol was the first Infernal Monster stylist to discover, to his detriment, the special interaction between Sanity-Devouring Night Terror and the Solar Charm Visage Made Law (see Lords of Creation (with errata), p. 80-81). If one of the victim's positive Intimacies have learned that Charm, his appearance in the dream will no longer be as an extra, but rather will carry his actual traits, Charms, panoply, and any other magic the character knows. In this way, Gorol was defeated when he attempted a dream assault on the Lunar wife of one of his most hated Solar enemies.</description>
        <comment>On Sanity-Devouring Night Terror: "Not an actual Overdrive, I designed it specifically with Overdrive in mind, and had a Hell of a lot of fun writing it. Originally I was going to make it a by-the-numbers upgrade purchase for Armageddon Nightmare Duel, and an actual Overdrive. It would preserve your current Overdrive motes as you transitioned into the dream, and it would give you a one mote per action drip. Michael thought I should spice it up, by making the Infernal Monster act like more of a terror. Holden concurred. I went back to my lab and brewed up this monstrosity. I am a proud mad doctor." -Ø</comment>

   Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts Form-Type Charm at a time. The character must end Snake Form to assume another Martial Arts form.</description>

   Snake Style is a Celestial Martial Arts style. Solar, Lunar, Abyssal and Sidereal Exalts, as well as Dragon-Blooded initiated into the fighting styles of the Immaculate Order, can learn it. It is a style traditionally practiced by the Solar Exalted, so only Solar Exalted can learn this style without a teacher.</description>

        <description>The Martial artist's anima flashes forward like a striking snake. Some Martial artists instead strike with the shadow of their hand. In either case, this Charm enhances an unarmed Martial Arts attack, letting the Exalt target an opponent up to (Essence x 2) yards away. The character's anima or shadow actually strikes the target, so an unobstructed path to the target must exist.</description>

They level more blows at their targets than most imagine possible. The strikes from this style rake and tear at their victims, inflicting great wounds with usually nothing more than a warrior's bare hands.
   Fighters who would learn this art must first prove they have the passion necessary and the fortitude to withstand the trouble that passion will bring them. Masters of the style do not resemble the composed and serene instructors of other martial arts. Instead, these martial artists let their emotions direct them in debate and in battle. They lash out with whatever technique comes to mind, at the foe who promises the most glory to defeat. Training includes complete and utter destruction of training dummies, fighting an undefeatable target with all of one's energy and practicing the most deadly strikes.
   Debaters who advance Valor ignore the arguments of others, often to the point where their own positions become unrecoverable. They don't care, trusting that their scathing invective has already torn their opponents down to nothing.
   Weapons and Armor: This style is compatible with the cestus, fighting gauntlet and khatar and their artifact equivalents, and it may be practiced in light armor.</description>

        <description>A valorous debater distracts his opponents by responding to their arguments with many different points, rather than actually defending his own position. Such foolhardy responses often worsen the debate for him in the long run but surprise his opponents and leave them scrambling to refute each point.
   Any attack the Exalt does not successfully parry or dodge triggers a quick strike in response. While this Charm is active, the martial artist may launch a counterattack against any foe who hits him. His counterattack dice pool equals the raw damage of the attack that triggered it, to a maximum of twice his (Dexterity + Martial Arts). The character may counterattack a given opponent only once for the duration of the Charm, and the character need not counter any attack if he does not want to. As normal, each counterattack reduces the character's DVs by one, and it is not possible to counterattack someone else's counterattack.</description>

        <description>By continuing to provide arguments without respite for her opponents, a debater can further her position as she hammers her points home. This tactic is often used when her many philosophic foes' arguments all stand separately.
   After activating this Charm on her action, the martial artist may precede any of her attacks in a flurry with a full Move action. She may not take less than a half Move action before an attack. Although it is a waste of Essence in single combat, using this Charm before a flurry allows the Exalt to sprint quickly between several enemies.
    Example: Sharp-Tongued Jiao has a Dexterity of 4 and uses Violently Advancing Theories as she begins her attack. Normally, she may move four yards in a turn and still attack. Splitting her dice pool five ways, she can now move a maximum of 20 yards (four yards before each attack) and a minimum of 10 yards (two yards before each attack).
   There must actually be a valid target to attack between each move. One may not use this Charm to strike the ground and move 20 yards in an instant.</description>

        <description>Prepared to argue the merits of his chosen path until he drops, a debater of Valor masters all forms of offense. He is equally skillful at direct arguments as he is at subtle insinuations that can drive his opponents mad. And he never hesitates to make cutting points against his opponent.
   While using this form, a martial artist adds a number of dice equal to his Valor dice to all offensive actions and to his bashing soak. Also, his attacks inflict lethal damage. When attacked by someone with a lower Valor score than his own, the character's frenetic, aggressive style acts as a deterrent, adding the difference in their Valor ratings to his DVs. Finally, the martial artist reduces any wound penalties by one.</description>

        <description>A skilled debater of Valor is always ready to respond to an opponent's arguments, not with one response but with two. Defending the qualities of her favored Virtue, she is fully able to strike down even prepared opponents with her forcefully accurate statements.
   The martial artist responds to an attack with a flurry of two counterattacks, each using her full dice pool. Her second attack naturally forces an onslaught penalty on the target. She suffers a -1 DV penalty for each counterattack, per the normal flurry rules (Exalted, p. 143). As usual, one cannot counterattack against someone else's counterattack.</description>

        <description>The valorous feed off their own successes. When a debater delivers an argument that strikes home, he exults and can follow up instantly with a series of further scathing remarks.
   This Charm is a magical flurry with a total DV penalty of -2. Any Martial Arts attack that hits a target spawns another. As long as the martial artist continues to strike targets successfully, he immediately follows up with another attack against any target within range. The Exalt can make no more than (Valor + Essence) attacks, but he must continue to attack as long as he can. When he misses a target, reaches the maximum number of attacks or can no longer afford the Essence for other Charms in a Combo, the flurry ends.</description>

            <description>City-killing hurricanes and raging forest fires best describe the elemental fury of this martial style. Practitioners of this art seem to never stop moving or attacking. They level more blows at their targets than most imagine possible. The strikes from this style rake and tear at their victims, inflicting great wounds with usually nothing more than a warrior's bare hands.
   Fighters who would learn this art must first prove they have the passion necessary and the fortitude to withstand the trouble that passion will bring them. Masters of the style do not resemble the composed and serene instructors of other martial arts. Instead, these martial artists let their emotions direct them in debate and in battle. They lash out with whatever technique comes to mind, at the foe who promises the most glory to defeat. Training includes complete and utter destruction of training dummies, fighting an undefeatable target with all of one's energy and practicing the most deadly strikes.
   Debaters who advance Valor ignore the arguments of others, often to the point where their own positions become unrecoverable. They don't care, trusting that their scathing invective has already torn their opponents down to nothing.
   Weapons and Armor: This style is compatible with the cestus, fighting gauntlet and khatar and their artifact equivalents, and it may be practiced in light armor.</description>

        <description>A debater strong in Valor often knows how to make cutting remarks that pierce deeply into the arguments, ideals and egos of her opponents. The points a martial artist makes with this technique are more dangerous than they appear and can tear an unsuspecting foe's foundation to shreds.
   If the character's Martial Arts attack wounds his target, the character sends a surge of angry red-black Essence flowing into the injury. Biting Remark becomes Obvious only as the attack inflicts damage, meaning potential victims can't know if the Exalt used the Charm until it is too late. In Step 10 of attack resolution, damage dice from this attack that come up 10 count as two successes. Additionally, the martial artist's player rolls a dice pool equal to the number of damage successes in Step 10. If this roll garners successes equal to or greater than the target's Essence, the attack cripples the target permanently. One limb, appropriate to the description of the attack, is rendered completely useless. Only supernatural healing can return it to functionality. Even Exalted do not heal this injury naturally.</description>

        <description>A valorous debater's verbal assault is often ferocious enough to leave his foes defenseless, unable to recover their previous positions. For such a fiery argument to be effective, it must be brought forth from the very foundation of the debater's position.
   Any attack flurry supplemented by this Charm is so unrestrained and fierce that it increases the onslaught penalty from the flurry by one. When invoking this Charm, the martial artist may spend an additional two motes and a point of Willpower to use the fury of his assault as a weapon against the target's soul. In addition to the aforementioned effects, the attack also inflicts aggravated damage and gains the Touch keyword, so it may not be performed with a weapon.</description>

        <description>Arguers skilled in Valor know that, to succeed in the debate, one must take up any point one can to turn the discussion to one's advantage, whether that point is integral to the foundation of one's argument or not. Such an attitude can sometimes get a debater into a tough position.
   Once a martial artist activates this Charm, she may use any weapon with her Martial Arts abilities and her Martial Arts Charms, excluding any Charms with the Touch keyword. Additionally, the character can wield even the heaviest weapon in one hand. The Accuracy and Defense bonuses of the weapon are ignored - the weapon becomes too much an extension of the martial artist.</description>

        <description>A skilled debater can inflict his own habits forcibly upon others, and those unused to wielding such passion have trouble restraining it. Some, usually opponents of the style, refer to this tactic as "dragging us down to their level".
   On a successful strike that inflicts at least one level of damage, the attacker's player rolls his (Valor + Essence) at a difficulty of the target's Temperance. If the attacker is successful, the victim's self control becomes a liability. Should the victim spend more motes of Essence than she has dots of Temperance in any given action, she loses one additional mote from the same pool for each dot of Valor she has, which burns off in an uncontrollable display. Regardless of which pool the motes came from (Peripheral or Personal Essence), they count toward the total that determines the halo effect of the character's anima banner. Each mote so lost also inflicts one level of unsoakable bashing damage.</description>

        <description>When a master of this style finds her stride, her arguments pierce the pitiful protests of her opponents. The remainder of the debate is likely to be hers, as her proofs become extremely sound and her logic unshakable. Or at least her opponents can't get a word in.
   A truly skilled warrior of Valor will use this Charm on nearly every occasion she can, mostly because such masters are also notoriously intemperate. This Charm adds the character's Valor in extra successes to any attack she launches, making her blows quite deadly. It subtracts a like number of dice from any action not directly connected with defeating her opponents.
       Martial artists under the effect of this Charm ignore wounds that would lay out anyone less dedicated to the ideal of Valor. The character reduces the effects of wound penalties by two, and this effect stacks with the effect of Instruction in Spirit. She may also reflexively spend a point of Willpower on her action in order to continue fighting even once her Incapacitated level is filled. She can do so until she runs out of Willpower or damage fills her last Dying level.
   This Charm cannot add more successes to the Exalt's attacks than normally allowed when using other Charms, such as Essence Triumphant.</description>

   Students of the art begin with many daily hours of meditation in various yoga positions. These are accompanied by a deliberately slowed form of each kata, working the students' muscles while allowing them to meditate upon each step. When a student progresses enough to learn further, her sifu asks her to define one truth of the style. Those who cannot have not spent enough time in meditation.
   In discussion, a student of Temperance is quiet and patient. She builds her argument with great deliberation, giving each claim a foundation of facts and logic, only rarely challenging an opponent's assertions but defending herself calmly, when necessary. After prolonged debate, the debater's opponent tends to grow thoughtful himself, eventually to the point of forfeit.

Only once he becomes familiar with his opponent's beliefs and strategy does he attempt a more direct action. By then, he has studied the form of his opponent's arguments and knows its flaws.
   This Charm increases both of the martial artist's DVs by an amount equal to his Temperance as long as he takes no attack actions or otherwise attempts to injure someone else. If he takes an offensive action, the bonus disappears. Cautious Comments cannot be activated during attack resolution. After a number of actions equal to his Temperance, the martial artist must pay the Essence cost again to maintain the protection.</description>

        <description>A careful word or a gentle reminder of a forgotten fact are all the practiced debater needs to upset her opponent. Spoken at the right time, a simple statement can distract or worry her opponent enough to weaken his argument.
    The martial artist attacks her opponent but need not hit. Afterward, their players roll a contested (Manipulation + Temperance) versus (the target's Valor). If the martial artist wins, her opponent loses a number of dice equal to the martial artist's Essence from any offensive action he attempts, as a Temperance not his own fights his actions from within. This Charm lasts until the victim allows the inflicted self-control time to be overrun by his natural zeal. Subtract the victim's Valor from the attacker's Temperance, to a minimum of one. After taking no offensive actions for that many consecutive actions, the victim is free of the Charm's influence.</description>

        <description>Among the debaters of the Virtues, only the philosophers of Temperance regularly ask questions. They claim it helps reveal their opponents' arguments to them and lets them more properly prepare their defenses. It irks their foes all the more that it seems to work.
   Focusing on his enemies, a warrior can judge their strengths and weaknesses while they fight. After activating this Charm, he must spend a number of Guard actions equal to the opponent's permanent Essence judging an opponent; the action in which he uses this Charm counts. The Guard actions need not be consecutive. At the end of that period, the Storyteller should tell the player a strength or a weakness of his foe's combat prowess, Charms or tactics.
   As an alternative to being told a strength or weakness of the opponent, the warrior may add a bonus of one success to his attacks or +1 to his DVs against the target. The total number of bonuses may not exceed the martial artist's Essence. Only the Storyteller's judgment limits how many strengths or weaknesses he may learn. The bonus lasts the rest of the scene.
    Example: Transcendent Rhetoric, a Solar practitioner of Meditative Discussion, fights Ourous, the Ravening Wolf, a Full Moon Lunar of Essence 3 who has 18 lethal and bashing soak, Hardness 12 and wields a moonsilver daiklave and related Charms. Upon activating Patient Questions and defending himself for three actions, Rhetoric learns the following: His opponent's hide and armor are far too thick to be affected by any light blows Rhetoric might inflict. It would be best either to focus his blows in one strong strike at a time or to pick up a convenient nearby sledge to lend weight to her offensive. If Rhetoric were to activate the Charm again and spend another three actions observing Ourous, he might learn that some of his opponent's most effective Charms require the use of his moonsilver weapons. Removing them, then, would significantly reduce Ourous' combat prowess. As an alternative for either of those, Rhetoric's player might request a bonus success on attack rolls and DVs with respect to Ourous, which would last the rest of the scene.</description>

        <description>By rephrasing an opponent's position to make it sound more like his own, the debater can use her arguments to defend himself. This tactic can be quite damaging for the opponent, who is forced to defend her foe's points to save his own.
   When the character controls a grapple, he can use this Charm to swing around and insert his victim's person between himself and another attacker. The interposed individual may apply her Parry DV against the attack in full. If the parry is not successful, the raw damage splits evenly between both grappling parties in Step 7, before applying soak. In a scrum where more than two people engage in a large grapple, the character must choose whom he uses, and only he and his victim are in danger of suffering damage from the attack. Some stunts and Charm-enhanced attacks may be proof against this defense at the Storyteller's discretion.</description>

        <description>A practiced orator for Temperance can manipulate her opponent's psyche by slipping subtle admonitions into the debate. Done once or twice, this technique can produce a distracting stutter or a disengaged train of thought. Enough of these quietly stinging words can drive even a master rhetorician into a stunned silence.
   With a command of Essence and knowledge of Temperance that only a master possesses, the warrior injects a substantial amount of her calm and considering Essence into the soul of a foe. This must be done by touch, requiring a successful strike or that the two combatants be grappling. The attacker's player rolls (Martial Arts + Temperance) against a difficulty of the target's Essence. If the martial artist wins, the victim becomes reluctant to act, gaining a one-die penalty to all actions. This penalty lasts the rest of the scene and is cumulative. Once the penalty equals a target's Valor, he becomes entirely quiescent, overcome with Temperance and unable to act for the rest of the scene. For each action he considers, he immediately thinks of good reasons not to do it. A target suffering this effect takes only Inactive or Guard actions. Someone under the effects of this Charm may spend a point of Willpower in order to ignore the penalty for a number of actions equal to his Valor. He may do so reflexively on his action. If a victim of this Charm isn't acting already, he can spend Willpower only on a tick in which the target would normally renew his inactive or guarding status, but it allows him to act immediately thereafter.</description>

        <description>As a great debate rages, one never knows whence an attack might come. Anyone might declare one's primary tenet worthless or seek to undermine the foundation of one's argument, so the wise debater has a deflecting argument always at the ready to defend his beliefs.
   Used in response to an attack, this Charm allows the Exalt to ignore all penalties to his Parry DV. It is still 0 if it is inapplicable. He may also parry lethal attacks barehanded, if he could not already do so. Finally, at Essence 4 or higher, the character can choose to spend a point of Willpower with this Charm in order to use his Parry DV against an unexpected attack.</description>

        <description>A wise person knows there are wiser heads than her own. She, therefore, shares her debates with others so that she can come to the correct decision.
   This Charm allows a martial artist to deflect the pointed arguments of her foes to others, weakening their foundation along the way. Against any attack, this defense cuts the attacker's successes in half (round up) before comparing them to the character's DV. A successful parry against that number means the martial artist deflects the attack - with its original number of successes-toward someone in the direction from which the attack came. Successfully dodging against the halved successes allows her to redirect the rest of the assault toward someone in the direction the attack was going. The new target must be within (Essence) yards. Should the character's defense fail, the attack hits her as if the successes had not been halved.
       Martial artists use this Charm both to break up an attack among friends, making it easier to parry and to bend attacks back at their foe's allies. The deflected attack cannot target the person who launched the attack.</description>

        <description>Just as canny observation makes the character's quips more piercing, so too does patience allow his arguments to ripen before they are plucked. After a period of silence, the debater unleashes a devastating series of cutting remarks.
   Invoking this Charm, the character settles down in a defensive stance to wait. What Have You Learned Barrage acts as a Guard action when used. For the next several actions, the martial artist stores away his potential to attack rather than applying it, waiting for the perfect moment. Each Guard action the character takes consecutively after activating this Charm adds one (to a base of zero) attack to his eventual flurry. Taking any action other than Guard, whether it is to dash, aim or perform any miscellaneous task, ends the Charm without any effect. Choosing to attack releases a magical flurry of stored attacks, all at full dice pool and with a total DV penalty of -0. The character may not bank more than (Temperance + Valor) attacks using this Charm.
   What Have You Learned Barrage counts as the character's Charm use for the action in which it is activated and the action in which it is released. In the intervening time, the character may use reflexive Charms for defense. When integrated into a Combo, the Combo's display appears slightly when the character activates the Charm. It burgeons slowly over his actions, bursting forth in full only when he releases his flurry. The character need not pay for any other Charms relating to the Combo until he attacks and knows for sure how many times he will do so. Finally, the Combo consumes all his Charm use until its completion, unlike using the Charm alone. From the time the character activates a Combo including this Charm to the time when he ends it, he may use only the reflexive Charms included in the Combo for his defense.</description>

        <description>A true master of Temperance looks upon the world and knows that its distractions cannot sway him. He resists both worldly temptations and the convincing face of his opponent, no matter the costs. No argument may pierce his defense because he has already considered every reasonable objection.
       Performing an impossibly simple kata, the martial artist completely blocks any single attack that targets him, including unblockable attacks. This defense carries with it the Temperance Flaw of Invulnerability. After invoking it, the character may not take any movement actions until his DV refreshes twice. (See Exalted, p. 194 for more information on the Four Flaws of Invulnerability).</description>

            <name>The Art Of Meditative Discussion Style</name>
            <description>Stillness and calm set the tone for this martial art. The practitioner is starkly defensive, unnervingly stationary until the blow is upon her. Then she reveals, with defenses smooth and elegant, that she was ready long before her opponents.
   Students of the art begin with many daily hours of meditation in various yoga positions. These are accompanied by a deliberately slowed form of each kata, working the students' muscles while allowing them to meditate upon each step. When a student progresses enough to learn further, her sifu asks her to define one truth of the style. Those who cannot have not spent enough time in meditation.
   In discussion, a student of Temperance is quiet and patient. She builds her argument with great deliberation, giving each claim a foundation of facts and logic, only rarely challenging an opponent's assertions but defending herself calmly, when necessary. After prolonged debate, the debater's opponent tends to grow thoughtful himself, eventually to the point of forfeit.
   Weapons and Armor: Students of this style learn to wield hooked swords, sais and seven-section-staves, even learning the unique combination of one hooked sword with one sai. They may also use the weapons' artifact versions. This style allows the use of armor.</description>

        <description>When a philosopher achieves true serenity, she knows that Temperance is truly the Virtue of most value and worth. Her assurance brooks no argument. She may ignore the debate that rages around her, and most cease to argue in the face of her perfect composure. They step down, for they also know she is correct.
   When the martial artist chooses to meditate upon the truths of the world, those around her realize the depths of her tranquility, and their hearts weep. Each time another character wishes to attack her, he must succeed at a Willpower check at a difficulty of (the character's Temperance). While using this Charm, the character may only take half Move actions and defend herself with reflexive actions and Charms. If she acts otherwise, the Charm ends.</description>

Practitioners of this style appear unassailable in their chosen stance, stolid and strong, and their attacks always come with a certainty that they will eventually connect.

   Debaters with great Conviction are almost impossible to sway. More than a few who choose to deny such a disputant's claims finally give up simply because the debater refuses to accept that her opponents have countered her points. It is the same in battle. Strikes of conviction sometimes succeed only because a combatant will not accept failure. Almost nothing can stop a person of great Conviction from reaching her goal... even if she's going the wrong way.

   A martial artist with this Charm increases her soak against a single attack. Her bashing soak rises by an amount equal to her Conviction and her lethal soak by half that amount (rounded up).</description>

        <description>One who truly believes in his cause will hurry, when he must, to complete his task and take the next step along the road to victory. If necessary, the debater will even sacrifice his argument's efficacy to get the point across.
   After activating this Charm, the martial artist may take up to his (Dexterity + Martial Arts) Move actions during the tick, as long as he attacks a target at the end of the movement. For every full Move action he makes beyond the first before he reaches his target, subtract one die from the following attack.
   This Charm becomes Obvious if the martial artist takes more than two Move actions to reach his target, as he moves more quickly than anyone can believe and trails Essence.</description>

        <description>Sometimes a debater's opponent can brush her arguments aside without admitting their purpose. Once the devotee of Conviction learns this skill, she becomes expert at pressing her point, often repeating it ad nauseam, until her opponent concedes the point or simply gives up.
   This magical flurry provides another attack as long as the attack previous was unsuccessful. Each attack uses the martial artist's full dice pool and increases the onslaught penalty as normal. The martial artist may continue to attack at her full dice pool until she hits her opponent. She can make no more attempts than she has dots of Conviction, however, and each repeated attempt must be identical to the original attack.</description>

        <description>A cunning student of Conviction tries to see the center of another's philosophy and undermine it directly, ignoring reasoning that logically should be eliminated before attempting to refute the core beliefs.
    By spending a mote on this Charm, the martial artist enables a single attack to ignore a number of points of his target's natural soak equal to his (i.e., the martial artist's) Conviction. For two motes, he can ignore a like amount of soak from armor. This condition applies equally to bashing, lethal and aggravated soak values. Both options can stack with each other or themselves, but the Exalt can spend no more motes on this Charm than he has dots of Essence. Reducing soak from armor reduces any Hardness from that armor by a like amount.
    Example: Confronted by a stone-armored automaton, Without Fear Lei augments an attack with To the Heart of the Matter. The golem's soak is 20B/16L (Stone plates, 16B/12L), and Lei's Conviction is 3. Lei may spend one mote to ignore three points of the automaton's natural soak or two motes to ignore six points of its natural soak. He could also spend two motes to ignore three points of the soak from its stone plating. As the automaton has only four points of natural soak, Lei instead spends three motes - one to ignore three points of natural soak and two more to ignore three points of armor soak. His final attack is against a soak of 14B/10L.
   If the automaton had Hardness that Without Fear Lei needed to overcome, spending two motes to reduce the soak from its armor would reduce that as well.</description>

        <description>Once a debater understands a foreign philosophy, she can use arguments from her own beliefs to either support or undermine those of her rivals.
   The martial artist has two options when using this Charm. Most simply, she adds a number of levels of damage equal to her Conviction to her attacks against inanimate objects by letting Essence guide her strike. Alternatively, she can add that Virtue to inanimate objects' soak (and Hardness) for a full scene by touching them as she invokes the Charm, using her Essence to counter its weaknesses. In the second invocation, the martial artist must actually touch every object that she wishes to strengthen. All the objects must be close enough that she can reach them all on a single tick, and she may touch no more objects than she has dots of Dexterity.</description>

        <description>The practiced debater of Conviction can learn when to ignore certain strictures and guidelines laid upon the debate, allowing him an opportunity to freely express his arguments and make his impact before a discussion's moderator slams the rules down once more.
    Essence makes things less solid, allowing the Exalt to ignore whatever inanimate objects stand between him and his target. The target of this attack gains no benefit from armor. Additionally, if there is something solid, such as a door, a wall or a window, between the martial artist and his target, the attack passes through it without affecting or being affected by it. Range for such an attack is hand-to-hand range, typically one yard.
   Attacking someone through an opaque object applies a -2 external penalty for not being able to see the target. A character may reduce this penalty to -1 if he knows his target's precise location.</description>

        <description>When there is no time to create a true defense for a claim, sometimes a sham will do just as well. The debater of Conviction recognizes this and does not hesitate to use falsehoods and partial truths to accomplish her goals. This defense will not weather the fiercest analysis, however. When it falls, it falls hard, pulling the weight of lies and misdirections upon its wielder.
   Weaving a complex but delicate defense with her martial skills and Essence, the Exalt adds an amount equal to her Conviction to her Parry DV against all the attacks against her in a single action. If this is enough to turn the blows, then the danger is over. When she does not successfully parry an attack, however, the conflict is resolved as though her DV had been zero the entire time - and against any later attacks, until she takes a new action.</description>

        <description>Debaters with true Conviction try anything to win discussions. When a debater recognizes a particular argument that his opponent uses to great efficacy, a timely turn of phrase can render that argument useless.
   With the perfect timing that only a Charm can provide, the martial artist counterattacks, performing a disarm on his attacker's weapon. Unlike usual attempts to disarm, this suffers no external penalty and adds two automatic successes to the attack roll. If the counterattack succeeds, the Exalt ends up holding the weapon. He may reflexively throw it (Strength + Athletics) yards in any direction, if he chooses.</description>

        <description>A master of this martial art might find herself treading over a snake pit in the fierce arguments that fly back and forth. But she listens as she argues, and her keen mind can still find her opponent's weakest points. When he makes a mistake, however small, she will correct him. And in that moment, she will destroy him.
   Her ultimate Conviction guides the Exalt's attack to the flaw in her foe's defense. Whatever Martial Arts attack she makes becomes utterly unstoppable - even when the target defends successfully, treat the attack as though it hit with one extra success. Only a perfect defense prevents her blow from landing.</description>

Students of this style slip into their opponents' strikes to unbalance them or use an attack's force to their own advantage.

Spirits have the most difficulty learning this style, as it requires them to relearn how to interpret their perceptions of Essence and the world around them.
   A compassionate debater rarely has the heart to reject an opponent's arguments outright. He merely seeks to clarify and correct, until he twists the argument to his own point of view. He lets allies make more confrontational statements. It is dangerous to call such a philosopher on his inability to defend his views, however. In short order, he will cast one's hypotheses to rubble, while apologizing for his every verbal blow. Some people need a little tough love...

        <description>Even a beginning debater of Compassion knows how to empathize with her opponents and get a feel for the state of the argument. She can discern where others stand on certain matters and how they will act, sometimes even before they do.
   The martial artist can sense people in her vicinity. Anyone within a radius of ([Compassion + Essence] x 5) yards cannot hide from her and cannot surprise or ambush her. She is considered aware of all entities and attacks from anyone within that range. This awareness does not give the martial artist the ability to maneuver without sight, though, as the character cannot detect walls, hidden pits and the like through this Charm. Likewise, this Charm cannot detect any creature without true sentience or with a Compassion rating of 0 (such as undead or automata).
   A character can use Hearing the Unspoken Word to track people outside of battle, but it is hard to distinguish between targets using only strength of empathy or desire as a measure. Only those of great Virtue (4 or more in Compassion or Conviction) or of passionate mind stand out easily from a crowd.
   Her supernatural sense also enables a practitioner to guess how people will act. When performing a Join Battle action, this Charm gives her two extra dice. Outside of battle, the martial artist's uncanny ability to discern what people have in mind reduces the difficulty of rolls to read motivation by one, and the Exalt's tendency to see through fronts and deceptions often unnerves those with whom she interacts.</description>

        <description>The arguments of Compassion lend themselves to the defense of others' arguments, and sifus encourage such acts. This practice can often win friends. Sometimes, it makes enemies.
   This Charm allows the martial artist to redirect an attack aimed at someone else to himself. For all purposes, including determining onslaught penalty, the attack becomes an attack on the Exalt. The character defends against the redirected attack as normal.
   To help someone, the attack's original target must be within the martial artist's melee range, though he may take his normal Move action for the tick to reach someone.</description>

        <description>A debater who masters Compassion knows that sometimes it is kindest to defeat an opponent quickly, for long struggles breed bitterness. She practices using blunt statements, difficult to turn aside, to undermine her foes' arguments in ways that leave them intact but unable to recover. Those who still try to argue find it more difficult to harm such a gentle soul.
   A master of Compassion deals a special stunning damage with her fists, fingers, palms and feet. Treat it as bashing, but only armor can soak this damage. A character who suffers this special stunning damage doubles the effect of his wound penalties. The stunning damage heals naturally at twice the rate of normal bashing damage. inflicting stunning damage upon a target who is Incapacitated does not inflict lethal damage or otherwise harm the target any further.
   This Charm also reduces damage by one die in Step 8, after soak but before the damage is rolled. This may reduce the number of dice below the attack's minimum damage.</description>

        <description>In the middle of a fierce debate, to accede gently in the face of great opposition can be disarming. Such a practice can render an opponent's argument nearly harmless to one's cause. The opponent seems churlish or fanatical to onlookers, who consequently dismiss her views.
   When a martial artist uses this Charm against an attack, he accepts the blow. The foe's attack hits him, but the character intercepts it before it can build up its full force, or he rolls with it. Either way, the blow is weakened. It automatically succeeds, but with only one extra success.</description>

        <description>Remaining quiet, the debater lets her opponent build on a faulty foundation. When the time comes for her to counter the fool's argument, she doesn't need to do anything more than point out its basic fallacy and watch it all come tumbling down.
   Invoking this Charm, the martial artist sees an attack from both her perspective and that of the attacker. This knowledge lets her identify her opponent's worst mistake and how to counter it. She parries or evades the attack, adding her Compassion score to the DV of her choice. If her defense succeeds, she immediately makes a clinch counterattack against the attacker with a dice pool equal to (Martial Arts + Compassion). For every point by which her DV exceeded her attacker's successes, she adds one additional die.</description>

        <description>Masterful orators can kill with kindness. Gentle and benign-seeming remarks can tear a foe's argument into pieces while seeming like assistance. Some opponents in the debate will stand, smiling, while their philosophies collapse around them. This method can be slow without special preparation, however.
   Using this technique in battle allows the martial artist to subtract from a foe's DVs and soak values a number of successes equal to his (i.e., the martial artist's) Essence dots. The attack is rolled and carried out normally, but if it overcomes the target's parry or dodge, the attack is treated as though it had only one extra success.</description>

        <description>The ability to give bad news kindly can make any news less harsh, and the same principle applies to debates. One practiced in Compassion can remove the edge from a cutting remark she hears, often rendering it harmless. The edges she removes often find their way back into the discussion - to her favor.
   This Charm can remove the magic behind any single attack that targets the martial artist. Any attack enhanced by a reflexive or supplemental Charm (or a Combo using them) is a valid target for this Charm. The martial artist's player rolls her (Compassion + Essence) in a resisted roll against the target's permanent Essence. If she accrues at least as many successes as her opponent, she strips away the reflexive and supplemental Charms aiding the attack.The martial artist gains the motes used to fuel the canceled Charms, to a maximum of (her Compassion x 2). These motes can only be used to fuel Compassion Charms - either those of this style or spirit Charms based on Compassion. The motes fade after 10 minutes if they are not used. Note that only spirit practitioners of this style and Eclipse or Moonshadow Caste Exalted are likely to have spirit Charms.
   Successful use of this Charm does not stop the attack. For example, an Exalt who uses this Charm against an archer's Essence Arrow Attack can still be hit by an arrow. But at least the arrow does not inflict additional damage. This Charm is Obvious if any of the Charms it affects are Obvious.</description>

        <description>With a little careful planning, the Compassionate master can surprise his opponents with enough sympathetic arguments and friendly overtures to throw her off balance, winning a serious advantage.
   The martial artist's player rolls (Compassion + Essence). Each success gives the Exalt one additional action for immediate use in this magical flurry. These are considered full actions for the purpose of performing any non-attack actions, such as stanching wounds, picking a lock or attempting to reestablish surprise. Showering Foes with Friendship may be used for offensive actions only if the action is created or supplemented by a Charm from this style or a Compassion Charm normally available only to spirits. Either option requires a Combo with Showering Foes with Friendship. This Charm may also be part of a Combo with Charms from other Abilities as long as they are not used to cause harm.</description>

        <description>A choice word can lift a man's spirits and soothe his troubled mind. This principle holds in debate, as a philosopher of Compassion can use her knowledge to repair the arguments of her friends. She can also help her enemies, knowing that it is hard to oppose one who does you such kindness.
   Any blow struck with the Soothing Word of Wisdom heals rather than harms. On a successful strike, which need not actually inflict damage, the martial artist's power heals one level of damage. Each time the character heals an individual, however, her Essence subverts his body. Anyone affected by this Charm suffers a -1 external penalty to any attack on the martial artist's person. This penalty lasts for the rest of the scene and accumulates to a maximum equal to (the target's Compassion x 2).
   Using this Charm costs two motes to heal a bashing wound and three to heal a lethal wound. It cannot heal aggravated damage. This Charm has no effect on a target who is in perfect health.</description>

    This Charm increases the martial artist's bashing and lethal soak by (Compassion x 2). It also gives him the reflexive ability to heal either one point of lethal or two points of bashing damage each action at a cost of one mote.

        <description>Sometimes, the only way to prove one's point to the opponent is to teach by example. Only by showing him the harm he has caused so callously can the debater break down her opponent's arguments and win the day.
   Once an attack connects, the Exalt invokes this Charm to share the pain with her foe. For every level of damage (not every die of damage) the martial artist suffers, her attacker suffers two unsoakable levels of special stunning damage as described by Instruction in Good Will.</description>

            <name>The Art Of Victorious Concession Style</name>
            <description>Like a gentle breeze that holds a leaf aloft, relaxed but always moving, this calm martial art can be a joy to behold. Many practice it as a healing art, sensing the flows of Essence through another and correcting them with a kind hand. The martial artist is always moving, handling his opponents' attacks as if he comforted a sick child. His defenses are soft, and his attacks are softer still. Students of this style slip into their opponents' strikes to unbalance them or use an attack's force to their own advantage.
   Training for this martial art involves performing katas blindfolded through obstacles and people, never touching either, and sitting in the living Essence of the small gods. Spirits have the most difficulty learning this style, as it requires them to relearn how to interpret their perceptions of Essence and the world around them.
   A compassionate debater rarely has the heart to reject an opponent's arguments outright. He merely seeks to clarify and correct, until he twists the argument to his own point of view. He lets allies make more confrontational statements. It is dangerous to call such a philosopher on his inability to defend his views, however. In short order, he will cast one's hypotheses to rubble, while apologizing for his every verbal blow. Some people need a little tough love...
   Weapons and Armor: The Art of Victorious Concession can only be performed barehanded, though a practitioner may wear any sort of armor.</description>

        <description>A speech of perfect kindness and love flows from the font of the debater's nigh-infinite compassion. All who are near him bask in his forgiveness and support, growing strong in their debate. Anyone who does not receive a bolstering word suffers a severe disadvantage in the prolonged discussion ahead.
   Gentle light flows from the martial artist's palms and touches everyone nearby with his comforting influence and power. All living creatures within (his Essence x 10) yards heal one health level for every success on a (Martial arts + Compassion) roll, recovering more deadly wounds before lesser injuries. This Charm heals aggravated damage, but it must first "spend" one level of healing to change the aggravated wound level to a lethal wound level.
    Example: This Charm affects Without Fear Lei after a battle that left him drained. He suffered two aggravated wounds, two lethal wounds and one bashing wound. The wash of healing gives him five levels of healing. The first four levels eliminate the two aggravated wounds: two levels to turn each of them into lethal wounds and then two more to heal them completely. The last level of healing removes one of Lei's lethal wounds. He is left with one lethal and one bashing wound.
   If Lei suffered three aggravated wounds instead of two, the last level of healing would change the last aggravated wound to lethal. He would go from three aggravated, two lethal, one bashing to three lethal and one bashing.
   In addition, invocation of this Charm acts as a social attack. Compare successes on the roll to the Dodge MDV of all sentient creatures within range. Targets have the opportunity to activate relevant defenses if they have not already used other Charms. Any target overwhelmed by the burst of supernal love cannot harm any other living creature until the martial artist leaves her presence or the scene ends. Someone affected by this aspect of the Charm can spend one point of Willpower to act normally for an action, and once she does so three times, she is free of the compulsion.
   If he desires, the devotee of Compassion may single out people whom the Charm shall not heal. Doing so costs him one additional mote per person, and to do so at all, he must spend an additional point of Willpower to subdue his overwhelming Compassion for all things. Such a target is not subject to the social effect.
       Loving Oration does not stack. A single character cannot use it repeatedly to keep healing injured people. Any damage that remains after one use must heal naturally or be healed by other Charms (including those of other practitioners of Victorious Concession).</description>

            <description>There is nothing "natural" about the Abyssal Exalted - but like all other Exalted, they find that when they apply their Essence to fisticuffs, wrestling and other forms of unarmed combat, certain Charms spontaneously appear. Abyssal martial artists do not fight like their Solar counterparts, with noble simplicity and straightforward blows. Rather, their natural art focuses on cruelty and overkill. It's a style for bloody-handed thugs who want to terrify their foes and leave a trail of corpses behind them.
   Deathknights with a particularly demented sense of irony sometimes call these Charms "Abyssal Hero Style", in mocking comparison with the Lunar, Solar and Terrestrial Hero Styles practiced by other Exalted.

   Weapons and Armor: As in Solar Hero Style, the form weapons of this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, razor harness and their artifact equivalents.

        <description>The Deathknight jabs his fingers or a form weapon at his opponent's eyes. This Charm supplements an unarmed attack. If the attack would inflict two or more levels of damage, Foe-Blinding Jab reduces that damage to a single level but inflicts a Crippling effect that blinds one eye (see Exalted, p. 152). Repeated use of this Charm causes full blindness. Exalted and similarly resilient beings heal this trauma with a day of rest. Mortals cannot naturally heal such maiming.
   If the Abyssal wishes, he can inflict blindness for only a few minutes by applying pressure or throwing a handful of dirt rather than gouging. In this case, the Crippling effect takes place as long as the attack hits, but the strike inflicts no damage.</description>

        <description>Abyssal warriors crush their foes with the unnatural strength of the risen dead. This Charm supplements a grapple attack. The contested roll to control the clinch plays out as normal... but the deathknight inflicts lethal damage. What's more, the raw damage of his clinch increases by one for each subsequent action the character maintains control of the grapple, to a maximum of the character's Martial Arts rating. The Charm ends and the damage bonus resets to +0 if the Abyssal stops spending Essence and squeezing to deal damage.</description>

        <description>The Chosen of the Void can hold their victims in death's own grip. This Charm supplements a grapple attack. As the deathknight and his foe struggle to control the grapple, the dice pool for the victim takes an internal penalty equal to the number of actions for which the Abyssal has already controlled the grapple. What's more, as long as the Abyssal controls the grapple, his victim cannot breathe. In a long struggle, the rules for holding breath (see Exalted, p. 130) could even come into play. The (Stamina + Resistance) roll to resist asphyxiation is always difficulty 3. More immediately, the victim cannot cry out or make any other sound in the Abyssal's grip.</description>

        <description>While the Abyssal performs the kata to assume Dark Messiah Form, she concentrates on every pain the world ever inflicted on her. Farewell ethics, it's time for bloody, brutal payback!
   While using this Charm, all the character's unarmed attacks inflict piercing damage (if they didn't already). The martial artist can make an unarmed Martial Arts parry against ranged and lethal attacks without a stunt. What's more, Dark Messiah Form eliminates multiple-action penalties for the first (Martial Arts / 2, rounded up) actions in a flurry. At Martial Arts 5, an Abyssal can punch three times in a flurry with no penalty at all. Any actions after the penalty-free number, however, take the same penalties as if this Charm had not been active. As a final benefit, a Dark Messiah stylist can attune to soulsteel form weapons (if he couldn't before) and gain all the motes stripped from a target by such weapons. The amoral ferocity of Dark Messiah Form comes at a price, though. While using the form, characters cannot channel their Virtues.</description>

        <description>This Charm imbues an Abyssal's attacks with horrible, crushing force, enabling her to break bones, dislocate joints and pulp organs with casual savagery. If the character inflicts two or more levels of damage with an unarmed attack, he may reflexively activate this Charm to reduce the attack's damage to only a single level of lethal damage but inflict one amputation disability (see Exalted, p. 152). Because the target organ or limb is mangled beyond use rather than actually severed, Exalted victims (and others with similar healing) can recover from the Crippling effect by spending a day resting, though they cannot heal any other wounds or other damage while regenerating this way. This Charm normally costs three motes and one Willpower to activate, but it costs only one mote if the victim is a mortal extra.</description>

Abyssal martial artists do not fight like their Solar counterparts, with noble simplicity and straightforward blows. Rather, their natural art focuses on cruelty and overkill. It's a style for bloody-handed thugs who want to terrify their foes and leave a trail of corpses behind them.
   Deathknights with a particularly demented sense of irony sometimes call these Charms "Abyssal Hero Style", in mocking comparison with the Lunar, Solar and Terrestrial Hero Styles practiced by other Exalted. Those Deathlords who remember the highly formalized martial arts schools of the First Age call it Dark Messiah Style. Most deathknights don't call it anything at all - it's just unarmed combat for Abyssals.
   Anyone who can learn Celestial martial arts can learn Dark Messiah Style. They find it a fixed tree of Charms, and cannot learn any Charms that branch off the basic set (as described on pp. 125-127). Only Abyssals and Deathlords can devise such new Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: As in Solar Hero Style, the form weapons of this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, razor harness and their artifact equivalents. Practitioners can also use improvised weapons - any convenient, sturdy object with a maximum Accuracy of -3 and Rate of 2, such as an unattuned daiklave, a coffin-lid or a corpse.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal strikes hard with a knee to the groin, or some equally "dirty" tactic, and inflicts debilitating pain. (The attack can be as specific as a called shot, but it incurs no called-shot penalty). If the target suffers any damage from this attack, he immediately drops prone and shifts to Inactive status (see Exalted, p. 143), though he remains conscious (and usually writhes or screams). This state lasts only five ticks, but the lingering pain from the Charm imposes a -1 internal penalty (a wound penalty) to all non-reflexive actions for the rest of the scene.</description>

        <description>Just killing an enemy is boring. Killing an enemy so brutally that every witness finds her heart and limbs numbed with terror... now that's satisfying. An Abyssal may invoke this Charm reflexively in Step Ten of attack resolution by spending three motes and one Willpower whenever he kills or mortally wounds an opponent with an unarmed attack. As a base effect, the Charm enables the deathknight to kill his victim in whatever horrific manner the player finds appropriate, whether tearing the foe in half, punching into her abdomen and pulling out handfuls of viscera or worse.
    Every enemy or neutral character who can witness this execution and has a Dodge MDV less than the Abyssal's (Martial arts + Essence) must pay one Willpower or be overwhelmed with horror as an unnatural Emotion effect. While afflicted with this fear and revulsion, characters suffer an internal penalty equal to the Abyssal's Essence rating to all non-reflexive actions for the rest of the scene. They cannot, however, be made to spend more Willpower or suffer further penalties through repeated use of Illustrative Overkill Technique. If it needs to be said, use of this Charm invariably prompts Morale checks in mortals, who tend to run screaming or fall to their knees retching.</description>

        <description>The Charm tree beginning with Fists of Iron Technique comprises the "natural" Solar style of unarmed fighting. The form weapons for this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, pankrator's cestus and improvised weapons. Solar Hero Style Charms treat attacks and blocks with these weapons as unarmed attacks and blocks. This includes the artifact versions of these weapons. A weapon is an "improvised" weapon if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2, such as a barstool, keg of brandy, omen hound or unattuned daiklave.
   For the other Exalted, this Charm tree is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the power of the heroes of the dawn. Celestial Exalted and Immaculate-trained Dragon-Blooded can learn these Charms, but they cannot develop or learn additional Charms for this tree.
   For the Solar Exalted, these Charms are ordinary combat Charms - they bring the grace, speed and power of the Sun's Chosen to bear. Solars can invent new Charms for this tree - such as Thunderclap Rush Attack and Knockout Blow, on page 190. These new Charms are treated as Solar Charms, not supernatural martial arts: Only Solar Exalted (and Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Exalted) are capable of learning them.
   The deathknight releases an opponent from a clinch by striking her with a brutal open-handed blow, hurling her away with the force of a maelstrom.</description>

        <description>A master of the Dark Messiah Style attunes her body, mind and Essence so perfectly to Oblivion that she becomes a conduit for its dread power to strike down any who lay hands upon her. A Dark Messiah stylist activates this Charm immediately after assuming Dark Messiah Form (effectively, making assuming the form a Speed 6 action that costs an additional Willpower point).
   While using Void Avatar Prana, the martial artist can reflexively spend one mote in response to any attack, or when she makes an attack. For a moment, her anima surrounds her in dark necrotic fire while her body becomes a black silhouette. This effect supplies a perfect block against any attack, even attacks that are normally unblockable. What's more, anyone who touches the Abyssal at that moment (whether casual contact, held in a grapple or making a hand-to-hand attack) suffers unsoakable lethal damage equal to the Abyssal's Essence score. The character can also activate Void Avatar Prana at the moment of making her own hand-to-hand attack and add this damage if her attack succeeds. Finally, the Abyssal's anima flashes totemic for that moment, with the usual effects on onlookers' Morale (see p. 101) given by all totemic Abyssal auras. In fact, if a non-Abyssal learned and used this Charm, his own anima would momentarily flare with the same effects as if he were an Abyssal.
   This Charm carries one of the Four Flaws of Abyssal Invulnerability.</description>

            <description>Oblivion bleeds through the body, mind, and Essence of the Dark Messiah, unleashing its dread power to strike down any who would lay hands upon him. Activating Dark Messiah Form for a surcharge of five motes and a point of Willpower, the martial artist becomes a conduit for Oblivion. An freezing aura of necrotic Essence emanates up to (Essence) yards from the martial artist, an environmental hazard with Trauma (Essence) and Damage 3B/action. His attacks channel the power of the Void, granting them the Overwhelming tag with minimum damage 3, and he adds (Essence) to his bashing and lethal soak.
   Enhanced: When used by an Abyssal, the environmental hazard deals lethal damage.</description>

The character can leap only as part of making an unarmed striking or grappling Martial Arts attack against a target.
   The cost to activate this Charm is normally three motes. If the Abyssal initiates a grapple and pays a point of Willpower, however, he adds to the attack roll a number of bonus successes equal to his Essence, and the defender cannot block or dodge the attack, except with a perfect defense.</description>

        <description>The Abyssal grows jagged bone spurs on his knuckles or fingertips. The character is still considered unarmed, but he can parry ranged and lethal attacks without a stunt. The bone blades add an amount equal to the Abyssal's Essence to the Accuracy and Dam-age of her punches and clinches, which inflict lethal damage. The bonuses become part of the traits of the character's unarmed "weapon" and do not count as dice added by Charms.
   Unfortunately, the protrusions impose a -3 internal penalty to Dexterity-based actions that require fine motor skills - including the use of weapons. This penalty is the Charm's primary Taint drawback for Abyssals who grow permanent weapons, not counting the obvious social implications for one's hands being covered in monstrous blades. Permanently acquiring such bone weapons costs the character four experience points or two bonus points at character creation.
   If the Abyssal has Essence 4+, he may grow spikes and jagged skeletal protrusions from any part of his body to apply these same bonuses to any natural unarmed attacks. Doing so could include growing massive shark-like fangs when biting to regain Essence, extruding joint spurs for tackling and so on. Non-natural unarmed attacks do not receive this bonus, even for the form weapons of a martial art. As a Taint, such extreme body modification costs four bonus points or eight experience points.</description>

            <description>There is nothing "natural" about the Abyssal Exalted - but like all other Exalted, they find that when they apply their Essence to fisticuffs, wrestling and other forms of unarmed combat, certain Charms spontaneously appear. Abyssal martial artists do not fight like their Solar counterparts, with noble simplicity and straightforward blows. Rather, their natural art focuses on cruelty and overkill. It's a style for bloody-handed thugs who want to terrify their foes and leave a trail of corpses behind them.
   Deathknights with a particularly demented sense of irony sometimes call these Charms "Abyssal Hero Style", in mocking comparison with the Lunar, Solar and Terrestrial Hero Styles practiced by other Exalted. Those Deathlords who remember the highly formalized martial arts schools of the First Age call it Dark Messiah Style. Most deathknights don't call it anything at all - it's just unarmed combat for Abyssals.
   Anyone who can learn Celestial martial arts can learn Dark Messiah Style. They find it a fixed tree of Charms, and cannot learn any Charms that branch off the basic set (as described on pp. 125-127). Only Abyssals and Deathlords can devise such new Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: As in Solar Hero Style, the form weapons of this style are the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatar, tiger claws, razor harness and their artifact equivalents. Practitioners can also use improvised weapons - any convenient, sturdy object with a maximum Accuracy of -3 and Rate of 2, such as an unattuned daiklave, a coffin-lid or a corpse.</description>

        <description>Blood gushes from the Abyssal's back and arms and hardens into rust-colored chains tipped with barbed claws. The Abyssal may grow as many as 13 chains, but there is no mechanical benefit to having more or less.
   While this Charm is active, the blood chains give the character an extra action on each tick when she acts. A character can buy this Charm more than once, up to (Essence - 2) purchases, gaining another extra action with each purchase. The chains use the Abyssal's full traits and go limp while the character is inactive for any reason. Actions taken by the chains may be enhanced with Charms as if any normal limb performed them, but they occur independently of any singular actions or flurries their creator takes and do not suffer normal multiple-action penalties. Use of Writhing Blood Chain Technique prevents the use of any other extra-action Charms, though.
   The chains cannot wield other weapons, but they can lash opponents up to (Essence) yards away. As weapons, the chains have the tags D, N, R. They have Accuracy, Damage and Defense bonuses equal to their creator's Essence, inflicting lethal damage. The chains cannot make clinch attacks on their own, but each of their actions may be used to impose a -1 external penalty to an opponent's roll to control a grapple if used to entangle rather than strike. The weapons are not considered unarmed attacks for the purposes of Martial Arts Charms unless that style wields fighting chains or whips as form weapons. When the scene ends, the chains dissolve in a splash of gore.
    Blood chains are vaguely self-aware and restlessly malevolent. If the Abyssal has no Willpower points remaining, the chains lash out at whatever targets the Storyteller chooses, tearing up the environment from boredom if they have no animate targets to maim or kill. It is not possible to voluntarily terminate the Charm before its duration while the chains act freely, though regaining a single Willpower point reasserts control. The Taint drawback of this Charm is that permanent chains present far more opportunities to lose control and cause unwanted collateral damage. Making the Charm permanent costs six bonus points or 12 experience points.</description>

   Solar Mirror: Once a Lawgiver has laid his hand upon an enemy, his wrath becomes inescapable. Even the Primordials learned this, to their sorrow. This Charm may be used to enhance a roll to maintain or gain control of an ongoing grapple, giving it an automatic threshold of one success more than the Solar's opponent. If another effect contests this one, add (Essence) in extra dice to the resulting roll.
   A second purchase of this Charm at Martial Arts 9+, Essence 9+, allows it to be invoked as an inherent ability, which does not count as a Charm activation.</description>

        <description>The prospective victims of the Abyssal Exalted wrap themselves in steel and hope it will save them. Rather than prying enemies out of this flimsy shell, it amuses the Chosen of the Neverborn to instead turn protection to torment. This Charm may enhance an unarmed martial arts attack, causing it to damage an opponent's armor such that buckles and plates are driven into the target's flesh. Should the attack successfully strike the target, then the target's armor raises its mobility penalty by one point and loses three points of bashing and lethal soak, and the attack inflicts one additional level of automatic, unsoakable lethal damage in step 10. The target may not remove her damaged armor without a difficulty 3 Dexterity + Medicine roll to extract the damaged portions from her flesh. Alternately, she may accept two additional levels of lethal damage as she rips the crumpled armor free. This is a Crippling effect.
       Mundane armor is permanently damaged by this Charm (unless manually repaired), but magical armor realigns itself one scene after it has been successfully removed, sustaining no lasting damage. Iron Maiden's Embrace is ineffective against unarmored opponents.</description>

            <description>In the final centuries of the Solar Deliberative, some Exalted explored the Underworld more than was prudent. Groups such as the Black Nadir Concordat did not want merely to protect Creation from the Underworld and the Neverborn, they wanted to make its power their own. The obscure and terrible Hungry Ghost Style emerged from these explorations and experiments. Given the style's associations, it seems likely that its creator became one of the Deathlords. It also seems likely that no style in existence could better metaphysically embody the innate cruelty and malice of the deathknights. At present, no one except Deathlords and Abyssals know Hungry Ghost Style. At least, no one else admits to it...
   Weapons and Armor: Hungry Ghost practitioners cannot activate or maintain their Charms while wearing armor. The style treats attacks made with tiger claws, fighting chains and razor harnesses as unarmed attacks.
   Complementary Skills: Hungry Ghost practitioners must know the way necrotic Essence flows. To learn this style, characters need at least one Occult or Lore Specialty related to ghosts or the Underworld, or initiation to Shadowlands Circle Necromancy.</description>

Some Abyssals see an active Essence as a network of fine, glowing veins overlain on a target; others perceive the Essence pool as the person's audible heartbeat, a rich taste of blood on the tongue, an odor or some other sensation.
   While using this Charm, an Abyssal can size up one chosen target within range as a miscellaneous action. Doing so costs one mote but does not count as Charm usage. Sizing up a target reveals the target's current wound penalty, her permanent Essence and the total number of available motes remaining in that character's combined Essence pools. For the rest of the scene, the martial artist senses any Essence expenditure by the target, though Blood-Scenting Hunger does not reveal the purpose for the Essence use. If the martial artist wants to know how an opponent suffered from an attack or how much Essence she spent from a Charm, however, he must spend another mote and take another action to re-assess wound penalties and Essence pools.</description>

        <description>Implacable fury infuses the martial artist's muscles with superhuman speed and strength, sending him from quarry to quarry in a blur of carnage. There is nothing remotely natural about the ways his joints contort and muscles flex in the course of each leap.
   This Charm supplements a flurry of attacks. After making each unarmed attack in the flurry, the Exalt can leap in a reflexive Move action to the next target, ignoring wound and mobility penalties to the distance he can travel. The Charm does not supplement the attacks themselves. They suffer the same penalties as if the character stayed stock-still.
   The most obvious use for this Charm is to set up another attack against a new target with the next action in the flurry. Since the leap only follows an attack, a character cannot use this Charm to close with an initial target in the flurry who is outside standard close combat range. If the Exalt faces a Counterattack Charm from a defender while leaping away, the character's Martial Arts rating adds to his Dodge DV.</description>

The soul-chilling touch of this projection halves the pool used to calculate the target's DV against the attack, rounded down. This Charm can enhance an attack to initiate a grapple as readily as a strike.
   Shrouded Claw Attack also causes any dematerialized being "touched" by it to manifest visibly to all onlookers as a translucent apparition for the rest of the scene. This effect applies whenever the attack would hit its target, even if the character has no way to make physical contact with immaterial beings (such as Hungry Ghost Form).</description>

        <description>The martial artist roars or howls in a scream of incalculable malice, allowing his worst impulses to possess him with their terrible power. Faintly glowing eyes betray those consumed by this martial arts form, illuminating features twisted into a rictus of taut tendons and clenched muscles.
   While this Charm is active, the character is considered a creature of darkness (assuming he wasn't already) and suffers from the effects of partially controlled Berserk Anger (see Exalted, p. 105), instantly reclassifying allies as enemies if they attempt to impede his rampage. Deactivating this Charm before its normal duration elapses costs one Willpower to shrug off the unnatural mental influence the martial artist exerts on himself.
   In exchange for these disadvantages, the martial artist inflicts lethal damage with all unarmed attacks and can parry lethal attacks barehanded, without a stunt. Each action, he may activate his choice of Lunging Phantom Method or Shrouded Claw Attack as an innate power without it counting as a Charm use. He can also make unarmed strikes or clinches against dematerialized beings, though clinched spirits can grapple back until either party breaks contact. As a final benefit, the martial artist adds his Essence to his Stamina for purposes of innate soak.
   As a side effect of learning this Charm, non-Abyssal martial artists gain the ability to purchase dots of Whispers without spending time in the Labyrinth. To walk in the steps of the hungry dead is to open one's mind to ultimate malevolence.</description>

        <description>When the Abyssal senses a foe (already examined and "tagged" using Blood-Scenting Hunger) using a Charm, she can lash out with a jabbing fist or slashing palm. A whiplash of her anima snaps out to strike at the Charm. The Abyssal can expend up to (Wits + Martial Arts) motes in this attack. If her target does not then expend an equal number of motes, added to his Charm's original cost, the Charm dissipates in a flash of sparks without taking effect. If the target pays the surcharge, his Charm takes effect as normal.
   Charm-Smothering Technique affects only the Charms of the Exalted, spirits and ghosts. It does not affect sorcery, necromancy, thaumaturgy, Fair Folk glamours or other supernatural effects.</description>

Scuttling Apparition Defense cannot defend against any attack that is unblockable, undodgeable or capable of hitting dematerialized beings, nor can it let a grappled character escape. Attacks supplemented by Charms that add automatic successes also might still strike. Since the Scuttling Apparition Defense is not truly a perfect defense, it does not carry a Flaw of Invulnerability.
   As a further benefit, the Abyssal can appear directly behind an enemy within range, giving an opportunity to attempt an unexpected attack (see Exalted, p. 155).
   Against flurries, Exalted may spend six motes when using this Charm to add an unnatural Illusion effect that confuses attackers as to the martial artist's location. Disoriented aggressors must pay a Willpower point or face debilitating waves of déjà vu and uncertainty that reduce all attack rolls in the flurry to zero dice.</description>

        <description>An Exalt with this Charm may conduct a withering torrent of entropic Essence through an exchange of blows, cursing an enemy with physical decrepitude and ill luck that worsens subsequent injuries. In order to use this Charm, the martial artist must touch the target with an unarmed strike or grapple attack that dealt at least one die of damage. The martial artist could also use a Martial Arts-based parry against a close range attack from the target and successfully block the attack. If the martial artist meets either requirement, all forms of the target's soak decrease by an amount equal to the Exalt's Martial Arts rating for the duration of the Charm, starting with natural soak. Non-magical armor acquires a thin layer of rust or rot when struck, though this rust does not cause permanent damage.
       Repeated exposure to this Charm uses the highest penalty rather than stacking. The martial artist may, however, activate this Charm repeatedly in an action to curse multiple targets. Note that piercing attacks halve the reduced soak rating. The reduction is not applied after the halving.</description>

        <description>The martial artist wounds an enemy's chakras with brutal precision, and his target feels the chill of the grave race through his veins. If the Abyssal's attack inflicts any damage, the target's next action is delayed by one tick as her muscles shiver and joints momentarily stiffen. What's more, her target loses one dot of Dexterity. This drain correspondingly reduces traits derived from Dexterity, including DV values. Lost dots return at the rate of one per minute.
   The Dexterity loss stacks; the delay in the target's next action does not. Victims reduced to Dexterity 0 are paralyzed. They can take no physical actions, though they can still think, talk (though chattering teeth) and use Charms that do not require them to move in any way. Blood-Freezing Technique does not affect creatures who are immune to cold or not alive, such as automata or ghosts.</description>

        <description>By attuning his anima to the twisting Labyrinth and the potential for Oblivion in all things, a deathknight becomes a shadow flickering about the battlefield. This Charm, the first secret technique of Hungry Ghost Style, supplements Hungry Ghost Form and can be used only immediately after an Abyssal uses that Charm, effectively making assuming the form a Speed 6 action. If the martial artist takes this additional tick and spends a Willpower, his movement distance when using Leaping Horror Approach or Scuttling Apparition Defense increases to (Essence x 5) yards.</description>

        <description>Arcs of deathly white Essence swirl around the Abyssal's hands, wailing like lost souls and burning the deathknight himself with the power of Oblivion. The character makes a Martial Arts attack. If the Abyssal's permanent Essence exceeds that of his target, the damage of his strike becomes unsoakable and aggravated as his body withers away into dust and his own soul shrieks in torment.
       Living people slain by this attack - including Exalts - rise as hungry ghosts on the next night. A slain extra leaves a hungry ghost extra; a heroic character leaves a correspondingly powerful hungry ghost. (See The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV - The Roll of Glorious Divinity II, or just use the hungry ghost on p. 318 of Exalted). They obey their killer for the next month as best they can comprehend his commands. Spirits, ghosts or Fair Folk slain by Soul-Flaying Strike evaporate on the spot, utterly destroyed.</description>

        <description>Few deathknights have even learned that Hungry Ghost Style has this secret final technique, which could set its masters to devouring their fellow Abyssals. By spending one minute monstrously gorging on the corpse of an Essence-wielder who died within the past hour, a master of Hungry Ghost Style can digest some of the deceased's mystical prowess along with her flesh and blood. He instantly intuits the basic description of every Charm the dead character knew as if they were all Obvious and may choose one of them to steal for which he meets all trait minimums (though this Charm cannot steal permanent Charms or Sidereal Martial Arts).
   If the master knows all prerequisites and is otherwise capable of learning the stolen Charm, he may pay the normal experience point cost to do so without training time or tutelage. If the Charm has permutations or variations, the martial artist learns it exactly as its original owner knew it, apart from using his own traits. If he does not wish to pay this experience or cannot learn the Charm for whatever reason, the stolen knowledge lasts only a number of days equal to its owner's Essence rating at the time of death. During this period, the martial artist may activate the stolen Charm as if he had learned it.
   There is no limit to the number of Charms an Abyssal can steal at one time, except that he can get only one Charm per fresh corpse and temporary thefts quickly fade once a killing spree ends. Once a body serves as a target for this Charm, too little of its residual Essence remains to provide further knowledge.</description>

Other Exalted tend to dismiss this logic as an idle boast, missing the point of Throne Shadow style. Viziers instinctively understand that the aspects and individuals of the world make for the best weapons, not fists or blades - and as a result, they tend to think of this martial art as Fate's Guardian style.
   For other Exalted, this is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the ways of the Seers of Heaven. They may learn the core Charms of the style, but may not expand upon it or learn any special extension Charms.
   For Sidereals, these Charms are ordinary Sidereal Charms, bringing the esoteric power of destiny to bear in their quest to guide Creation and its rulers toward a better future. Sidereals may invent new Charms for this tree, and these are considered Sidereal Charms, not Celestial Martial Arts Charms. This distinguishes Throne Shadow style from the other instinctively-grasped art of the Sidereals, Violet Bier of Sorrows, which is a closed style designed for the Viziers by the Maiden of Endings.
   Weapons and Armor: This style counts as unarmed attacks the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatars, pankrator's cestus, tiger claws, and other such 'brawling aides', as well as improvised weapons. It is compatible with any sort of armor.</description>

        <description>Sidereals understand the world; much of their power to act upon the world proceeds from this fact. When the character perceives an individual whose Martial Arts rating is equal to or higher than his own, that fact becomes Obvious to his senses unless the character is using a supernatural disguise of some kind. Alternately, for a cost of 3m, the character knows all combat Abilities a perceived individual possesses which are rated equal to or higher than his Martial Arts rating.</description>

        <description>Sidereals deceive the world, presenting themselves as less than what they are; much of their power to act upon the world proceeds from this fact. The Sidereal cloaks herself in the humble and unassuming air of the neophyte student, the civil servant, or the hanger-on in the company of legends. She seems unthreatening, imposing a -3 external penalty on all attempts to gauge her nature and the level of her skill. This unassuming mien also makes it difficult to view the Sidereal as a serious threat; all attempts to re-establish surprise enjoy a bonus of (Sidereal's Essence) dice. This Charm constitutes a form of unnatural mental influence costing two Willpower to resist for one scene.</description>

Disdaining such crude weapons as fighting gauntlets or appropriated barstools, the Sidereal turns others into his instruments - be they pawns or kings. The Sidereal may enlighten an individual with five minutes of one-on-one advice and simple-but-profound martial demonstrations. The beneficiaries of such instruction temporarily enjoy one bonus dot of Martial Arts and add the Sidereal's Martial Arts rating to their Dodge MDV so long as the Vizier commits Essence to this Charm. She may sustain a commitment to up to (Essence x 2) beneficiaries at once. Sidereals know such beneficiaries as shadow fingers.
   If the character is a Sidereal Exalt, she automatically becomes aware when one of her shadow fingers is attacked, regardless of the distance separating them.</description>

            <description>This Charm tree comprises the natural Sidereal style of unarmed fighting. The Viziers say: "Every Sidereal is a master of the arts - even on his first day in the dojo". Other Exalted tend to dismiss this logic as an idle boast, missing the point of Throne Shadow style. Viziers instinctively understand that the aspects and individuals of the world make for the best weapons, not fists or blades - and as a result, they tend to think of this martial art as Fate's Guardian style.
   For other Exalted, this is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the ways of the Seers of Heaven. They may learn the core Charms of the style, but may not expand upon it or learn any special extension Charms.
   For Sidereals, these Charms are ordinary Sidereal Charms, bringing the esoteric power of destiny to bear in their quest to guide Creation and its rulers toward a better future. Sidereals may invent new Charms for this tree, and these are considered Sidereal Charms, not Celestial Martial Arts Charms. This distinguishes Throne Shadow style from the other instinctively-grasped art of the Sidereals, Violet Bier of Sorrows, which is a closed style designed for the Viziers by the Maiden of Endings.
   Weapons and Armor: This style counts as unarmed attacks the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatars, pankrator's cestus, tiger claws, and other such 'brawling aides', as well as improvised weapons. It is compatible with any sort of armor.</description>

        <description>Combining insight, deceit, and the shadow fingers she has accumulated, the Sidereal makes a terrible fist with which to guard all things within destiny's design. While this Form is active, all shadow fingers within (Dexterity x 3) yards are considered to be protecting the martial artist with a Defend Other action at all times. Additionally, the Sidereal may launch coordinated attacks with her shadow fingers, substituting Martial Arts for War, and such attempts are made at difficulty 1 regardless of the number of fingers participating in the attack. The Sidereal and her fingers may also strike dematerialized targets while this Form is active, though this Charm does not help them find and target such beings.</description>

        <description>The world of the Exalted is a world of vast, eye-catching luminaries; nobody notices a shadow lost in the tangle of the crowd. This Charm enhances an attempt to re-establish surprise in a crowd (defined as a scene in which at least 20 characters are present), producing a -2 external penalty on attempts to spot the Sidereal. If the Sidereal has at least two shadow fingers present, this also qualifies as a crowd, permitting her to attempt to re-establish surprise.</description>

        <description>Sidereals are known for their discretion, never sullying the courts of the Lawgivers with the blood of would-be assassins or the screams of intercepted fanatics. Their killing arts are cleaner than that. This Charm supplements an unarmed martial arts attack. Should it successfully strike its target, that individual's breath is sealed, and he begins suffocating (see Exalted, p. 130). The target may make a reflexive (Strength + Athletics) roll every thirty seconds at a difficulty of the martial artist's Essence rating to attempt to break free and resume breathing normally. Until he does so, he suffers a -2 internal penalty to all actions. The martial artist may also restore a target's breath by striking them with this Charm again.
   If used by a Sidereal Exalt, then this Charm may alternately be used to steal the target's breath altogether. The Sidereal may subsequently try to strangle the target with her own breath, treating such attempts as a dire chain-assisted grapple attempt. Should the target regain her breath, this weapon vanishes from the Sidereal's grasp.</description>

        <description>There is no deadlier weapon than truth, which Sidereals may unleash on destiny's behalf. Should an unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm strike its target, they are poisoned with a toxin with the following traits: (Special/one hour, 5,  -/ -, -1). Rather than doing damage, this toxin infects the victim's chakras and her mind, rendering her incapable of lying or dissembling. Should she speak, she may only speak the truth as best she knows it.</description>

        <description>The Sidereals are destiny's guardians and the eyes of the Exalted. Their vision must not be clouded, and those who would attempt such stratagems must be punished. While this Charm is active, the Sidereal may launch an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack in step nine against any individual who attempts to inflict unnatural mental influence on him. If this influence is ongoing, the counterattack triggers the first time the Sidereal is exposed to it after activating Clear Eyes Defense.
   If the character is a Sidereal Exalt with Essence 3+, then a counterattack which successfully strikes its target also perfectly negates the unnatural mental influence which triggered it.</description>

The Exalt makes an unarmed martial arts attack; all hidden characters within (Martial Arts x 10) yards must make a reflexive opposed Dexterity + Stealth roll against the attack's successes. Should the Sidereal garner more successes, then a series of ripples and distortions in the air give away the individual's location and render stealth impossible for five actions. This Charm also automatically reveals dematerialized beings within its range in this manner.</description>

        <description>Improvisation is a cherished skill of brawlers and courtly guardians alike. The Sidereal rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts), issuing an exhortation to abandon arms and loyalties and rally to him for the sake of the world's preservation. This battlefield plea is ineffective against heroes and supernatural beings, but the weak minds of the world's extras may be easily swayed to change their loyalties. Compare the Sidereal's roll to the highest MDV of any hostile extra present; should the Sidereal succeed, (Essence x 2) extras switch sides and immediately begin fighting under the Sidereal's leadership (assuming that so many are present). These extras are considered to be shadow fingers until the end of the scene; after that point, the Sidereal must use Sifu's Useful Fingers on them if he is to retain them as his tools. This Charm's unnatural mental influence costs three points of Willpower to resist.
   If the character is a Sidereal Exalt with Essence 4+, then this Charm may also win the loyalty of mindless automatons, including undead, though such beings add their master's Essence to their MDV if they are under magical control.</description>

            <description>This Charm tree comprises the natural Sidereal style of unarmed fighting. The Viziers say: "Every Sidereal is a master of the arts - even on his first day in the dojo". Other Exalted tend to dismiss this logic as an idle boast, missing the point of Throne Shadow style. Viziers instinctively understand that the aspects and individuals of the world make for the best weapons, not fists or blades - and as a result, they tend to think of this martial art as Fate's Guardian style.
   For other Exalted, this is a Celestial Martial Arts style that emulates and imitates the ways of the Seers of Heaven. They may learn the core Charms of the style, but may not expand upon it or learn any special extension Charms.
   For Sidereals, these Charms are ordinary Sidereal Charms, bringing the esoteric power of destiny to bear in their quest to guide Creation and its rulers toward a better future. Sidereals may invent new Charms for this tree, and these are considered Sidereal Charms, not Celestial Martial Arts Charms. This distinguishes Throne Shadow style from the other instinctively-grasped art of the Sidereals, Violet Bier of Sorrows, which is a closed style designed for the Viziers by the Maiden of Endings.
   Weapons and Armor: This style counts as unarmed attacks the cestus, fighting gauntlet, khatars, pankrator's cestus, tiger claws, and other such 'brawling aides', as well as improvised weapons. It is compatible with any sort of armor.</description>

        <description>Choosing the arc of her blow, the Sidereal writes it into forthcoming fate. An unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm gains the Piercing tag and halves any DV applied against it. A second purchase of this Charm requires Martial Arts 5+, Essence 4+. For a seven-mote surcharge, this Charm also renders the supplemented attack both unblockable and undodgeable.</description>

        <description>Coming to understand the movements of her enemy, the Sidereal interrupts them an instant before they happen. Whenever the Sidereal applies his unarmed Parry DV against an attack made in close combat range, he may activate this Charm. She makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack roll in Step 6, subtracting her rolled successes from those of the attack roll which provoked her counter, parrying it completely if the successes are reduced below her Parry DV. She then applies this roll as an unarmed counterattack in Step 9, doing damage normally if it hits.</description>

        <description>Feeling along a tenor of fate, a Sidereal may strike at her opponent's relevance, separating the momentous from the also-ran. This Charm supplements an unarmed martial arts attack; should the attack strike its target, that all of that target's actions raise their Speed by one for (Sidereal's Essence / 2, round up) actions. Subsequent strikes reset this timer and cumulatively increase the Speed of the target's actions. This Charm may not raise a target's Speed higher than 7.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal, having enriched the world with his lessons, has earned its gratitude. It moves to punish those who would attempt to strike down such a wise master. All shadow fingers within range of the Sidereal's attacker reflexively launch one attack with the combat Ability of their choice at that individual. With Martial Arts 7+, Essence 7+ the Sidereal may add a one-Willpower surcharge to this Charm's cost to automatically render this mass-counterattack a coordinated attack. Individual shadow fingers may opt not to participate in this attack if they choose, at no cost. This Charm may be used no more than once per action.</description>

        <description>Sidereal sifus convey their teachings through parables and secret meanings, giving their students strange lessons whose purpose is only revealed when they are completed. To utilize this Charm, the vizier spends a scene in the company of a pupil and then explains how the events of the scene taught a particular Martial Arts Charm the Sidereal knows. The student may not be in experience debt and must be capable of learning the Charm in question (i.e. possesses all prerequisites, trait requirements, etc.). If the Charm is beyond the understanding of the student, it cannot be taught, so Dragon-Blooded cannot learn Celestial Martial Arts without unless they have undergone appropriate enlightenment and can't learn Sidereal styles at all. Only the willing mind can learn, so students who reject the lesson gain nothing from it.
   A sifu's explanations can be direct and obvious or convoluted and contrived, but the Storyteller must approve the lesson. For instance, having the student punch boards until his knuckles bleed is a clear way to teach Fists of Iron Technique. More abstractly, the sifu could watch the student dancing with her beloved and remark how the formalized grip of the waltz taught her Dragon Coil Technique. Once the Storyteller approves the explanation, the Sidereal pays two Willpower and the student instantly learns the Charm in question as a Training effect.
   With Martial Arts 6+, Secret Lesson Revelation becomes more potent. The sifu can teach Martial Arts Charms he does not personally know to his shadow fingers, provided he has seen the Charm used on at least five separate scenes to become familiar with its precepts.</description>

            <description>This ancient Celestial martial art dates back to the Primordial War. Invented and first demonstrated by the Lunar warrior Owl-Feathered Princess, its Steward practitioners insist that it was the first non-animal style martial art developed during the War. The Sidereals scoff, but the deployment of time-warping weaponry during the War makes establishing a solid timeline of innovation impossible. Luna has been known to favor the style's practitioners when wearing her Silver-Horned Watcher aspect.
   White Reaper is a rare style in Creation's Age of Sorrows, practiced and taught primarily by a very small handful of elder Lunars. It has experienced a recent resurgence in popularity among the Swords of Luna, although the high mortality rate of that particular faction keeps the style's relative number of practitioners low. The style is widely known and practiced in Autochthonia, where it is viewed as an effective weapon to be turned against the Void.
   Weapons and Armor: White Reaper style treats attacks made with the scythe, the spear and their artifact equivalents as unarmed for the purpose of its Charms. It is fully compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>The martial artist presents a constantly moving defensive screen. Any imperfections in this array of blocks and deflections are mere illusions, which disappear a heartbeat after they are seen. The character selects a single opponent when activating this Charm. Not only does she enjoy immunity to onslaught penalties when attacked by this adversary, but the opponent's multiple action penalties are (non-cumulatively) doubled for every action in which he attacks the martial artist.</description>

Luna has been known to favor the style's practitioners when wearing her Silver-Horned Watcher aspect.
   White Reaper is a rare style in Creation's Age of Sorrows, practiced and taught primarily by a very small handful of elder Lunars. It has experienced a recent resurgence in popularity among the Swords of Luna, although the high mortality rate of that particular faction keeps the style's relative number of practitioners low. The style is widely known and practiced in Autochthonia, where it is viewed as an effective weapon to be turned against the Void.

        <description>The martial artist rears up into a grim and terrifying battle posture, regarding her opponents as little more than grass to be scythed down before her. All unarmed attacks made by the martial artist add one to their Accuracy and Rate, and her bare-handed attacks inflict lethal damage.
       More notably, every time the character slays an opponent or inflicts damage on a complementary unit in mass combat while this Charm is active, a halo of sizzling silver-white Essence surges around her like a second skin and adds one to her Dodge MDV. The martial artist may retain up to (Essence) halos at once. Any opponents slain in excess of this number simply create a brilliant argent discharge around the martial artist, accomplishing nothing. All standing halos dissipate when this Form-Type Charm is deactivated.</description>

Additionally, for each halo the martial artist is carrying from White Reaper Form, she adds one to the Accuracy of an unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm. As equipment bonuses, accuracy dice gained from a halo do notcount as dice added by a Charm for the purpose of dice-adding caps. Invoking Bleeding Crescent Strike spends all halos the character has, resetting her current number to zero.</description>

Yet, the target of the unexpected attack must not have made any physical attack previously in the scene (counterattacks are permitted).

        <description>Crane stylists do not initiate hostilities - they finish them. This Charm may be activated in response to any physical attack targeting the martial artist and notes the attacker and the number of successes rolled for the attack prior to applying the martial artist's defenses. Whenever the martial artist next makes an unarmed attack or counterattack roll against the noted attacker, her roll adds a number of extra successes equal to those noted. An attack enhanced with these successes inflicts its usual type of damage, but the actual levels applied to an enemy in Step Ten convert into bashing damage that cannot spill over past Incapacitated to impose lethal wounds. If an enhanced attack inflicts any levels of damage, the opponent is automatically knocked prone by the force of the blow. Reactivation of Empowering Justice Redirection resets the noted aggressor and number of successes, replacing any prior activation.</description>

            <description>Developed by Sidereal Exalted during the Primordial War as a means of teaching newly Exalted Celestials the ways of martial arts without risk of deadly training accidents, Crane Style emphasizes defensive maneuvers, restraint and empathy for opponents. The style does not permit armor, but considers hook swords and war fans (as well as the magical versions thereof) as unarmed attacks for the purposes of its Charms. Most commonly, these weapons are wielded paired, as a one-winged crane is considered highly inauspicious. In the Second Age, the main practitioners of this Celestial martial art are Gold Faction Sidereals who run the training camps of the Cult of the Illuminated, applying the style's techniques to their original purpose as they prepare Solar Exalted to face the enemies of Creation.</description>

        <description>The crane is not a violent animal, it is an elegant one. While this Charm is active, the martial artist ignores the off-hand penalty for actions while wielding paired form weapons. If wearing clothing with long, flowing sleeves, she adds one to her Parry DV (and her clothing will never be torn or stained by using it to parry attacks), and her barehanded attacks gain the R tag. She automatically succeeds on all Athletics checks to retain her balance and exerts no effective weight on any solid object, allowing her to balance on a pine tree's needles or run across a spider web as readily as firm ground. The Charm doubles the dice bonus (but not actual level) of all stunts made to enhance unarmed Martial Arts actions and allows such stunts to recover a Compassion channel in place of other awards if the action succeeds. Finally, all damage inflicted by the martial artist's unarmed attacks is limited to bashing injury as per the effects of Empowering Justice Redirection.</description>

        <description>The grace of the crane inspires those who bear witness to it. A martial artist who knows this Charm may enhance her unarmed Martial Arts attacks and parries with the same descriptions as a social attack, provided that her spoken words analyze her opponent's fighting techniques and offers helpful advice to improve them. Thus, comments by players speaking in character provide a one-die stunt, et cetera. Social and conventional physical criteria do not stack as such, though a combination of visual and literal poetry may certainly net a higher stunt award at Storyteller discretion.
   As a secondary benefit, if the martial artist takes a dramatic action lasting one minute in which she spars with a single individual, both combatants treat that minute as a day of training time for the purposes of purchasing dots of Martial Arts, Martial Arts specialties or Martial Arts Charms. This acceleration is not a Training effect and does not allow purchase of traits the combatant's player lacks the banked experience points to afford.</description>

        <description>Gentle masters write their lessons in bruises, not cuts. While a character with this Charm has Crane Form active, he does not need to spend a Willpower point to channel Compassion to enhance an unarmed Martial Arts attack or parry. Moreover, whenever he does channel Compassion this way to improve an attack, he also adds the dice bonus from the channel to the attack's raw damage and he may choose to arrange inflicted bruises as calligraphy upon the victim's skin when inflicting any levels of damage.</description>

        <description>What monster kills so beautiful a bird? This Charm may be activated in response to any physical attack of which the martial artist is aware, allowing her to make a perfect unarmed parry even against unblockable attacks. Doing so costs a number of motes equal to the number of times she has activated Crossed Wings Denial previously in the scene. Use of this Charm prevents the martial artist from making any physical attacks on her next action as a special flaw of invulnerability. Counterattacks are not similarly prohibited.</description>

        <description>With a mighty beat of its wings, the crane shames feathers bound to shafts. They understand the lessons that their archers do not. This Charm is an unarmed (Dexterity + Martial Arts) counterattack that may be activated in response to any ranged attack with a solid projectile. The projectile may strike the martial artist or not depending on her defenses, but regardless, the counterattack hurls the projectile at an armed character no farther away than the distance between the original attacker and the martial artist. The target of this counterattack need not be the attacker who prompted it. If the counterattack hits, it inflicts no damage, but the opponent is automatically disarmed and the weapon flies five yards away in a direction of the martial artist's choice.</description>

        <description>It is the nature of a crane to grab a frog that passes beneath its beak. It is the nature of Crane Style to strike those who strike first. A martial artist using this Charm cannot make physical attacks against other animate beings, but this prohibition does not extend to counterattacks. While Beak Spears Frog is active, however, the character may respond to any physical attack against him in Step Nine with a single unarmed counterattack, provided he can reach the attacker to do so. Counterattacks made this way suffer an internal penalty equal to the multiple action penalty of the attacks to which they respond, but are otherwise made at the character's full dice pool.</description>

        <description>Majestic and beautiful is the soaring crane. In activating this Charm, the character extends his arms to either side, hands pointed down, and glides up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards in any direction. If this path terminates in midair, he remains suspended in defiance of gravity for the duration of the Charm with enough mobility to dodge without actually moving from his location. He cannot reactivate Wings Spread to Sky until his DV refreshes. The Charm may be used to abort a fall safely or rise higher from the apogee of a jump. If used to pull away in response to an attack, the attack resolves normally before the martial artist moves. Defensive gliding can interrupt a flurry if the martial artist moves out of the attacker's reach, ensuring that successive attacks automatically miss.
   When Wings Spread to Sky ends, the character glides another (Martial Arts x 5) yards or less in any direction before gravity resumes its hold upon him. This can allow him to land safely from a great height or deposit him on a safer perch. Termination of the Charm can also close the distance to an opponent to deliver an unarmed attack or counterattack (effectively extending the reach of the attack). Closing to strike this way doubles extra successes for the purposes of calculating the attack's raw damage, but only the first attack in a flurry enjoys this bonus.</description>

        <description>The crane is a sacred animal. How much more so are the masters who understand its ways? Upon learning this Charm, the martial artist converts all Combos solely containing Crane Style Charms into the experience points needed to acquire them. Combos containing Charms outside the style remain. Through the Wisdom of the Celestial Crane, the character can activate any Combo solely containing Crane Style Charms as though she knew that Combo and she considers Crane Form Combo-OK for this purpose. She does not need to spend Willpower to activate a Combo intuited through this Charm. Finally, if she is using Crane Form, whenever an unarmed attack she makes inflicts any levels of damage to a creature of darkness, that being also loses a Willpower point. Victims who lose their last Willpower point this way instantly form an Intimacy of love for Creation.</description>

Wisdom of the Celestial Crane can enhance any unarmed counterattack, adding (Essence) dice to its post-soak damage. An attack that successfully deals bashing damage also causes its victim to lose a point of Willpower.
   A character who loses their last Willpower point this way or who is reduced to their Incapacitated health level by a supplemented attack instantly forms an Intimacy of love for Creation, as an irresistible unnatural Emotion.</description>

            <description>This ancient Celestial martial art dates back to the Primordial War, when it was innovated and used by the Chosen of Mercury to help deliver vital messages despite overwhelming Primordial opposition. Demons and Lintha alike were left blinking and confused as practitioners quickly blurred through their blockades, leaving only footprints and corpses to mark their passing.
   It is still strongly favored today for its mixture of surprise and speed. Those who have fought a Blinding Prism (as practitioners of this style are known) rarely know precisely what hit them, and that suits the needs of the Viziers of the Second Age perfectly. Unbeknownst to its Sidereal inventors, the style is also widely popular in Autochthonia.
   Weapons and Armor: Crystal Chameleon style treats attacks made with the spear, rope dart, weighted rope and their artifact equivalents as unarmed for the purpose of its Charms. It is incompatible with armor.
   Complementary Abilities: To properly execute the lightning-fast movements and sudden ambushes of the style, practitioners must have at least three dots spread between Stealth and Athletics.</description>

        <description>Radiating Essence through his chakras in a precisely controlled array, the character breaks light around himself, creating intermittent highlights of illumination and shadow throughout the area which help draw attention away from himself. This Charm may supplement an attempt to reestablish surprise (see Exalted, p. 156) during combat, adding three automatic successes to the attempt. If the character enjoys more than 50% hard cover due to the environment at the time of activation, the Charm provides four automatic successes instead. The martial artist must still have the opportunity to attempt to reestablish surprise in the first place.
   This Charm is known in Autochthonia as One Wire Among Many.</description>

            <description>This ancient Celestial martial art dates back to the Primordial War, when it was innovated and used by the Chosen of Mercury to help deliver vital messages despite overwhelming Primordial opposition. Demons and Lintha alike were left blinking and confused as practitioners quickly blurred through their blockades, leaving only footprints and corpses to mark their passing.
   It is still strongly favored today for its mixture of surprise and speed. Those who have fought a Blinding Prism (as practitioners of this style are known) rarely know precisely what hit them, and that suits the needs of the Viziers of the Second Age perfectly. Unbeknownst to its Sidereal inventors, the style is also widely popular in Autochthonia.
   Weapons and Armor: Crystal Chameleon style treats attacks made with the spear, rope dart, weighted rope and their artifact equivalents as unarmed for the purpose of its Charms. It is incompatible with armor.
   Complementary Abilities: To properly execute the lightning-fast movements and sudden ambushes of the style, practitioners must have at least three dots spread between Stealth and Athletics.</description>

        <description>Collapsing her Essence into pure forward momentum, the martial artist briefly blurs and disappears from sight. This Charm supplements a Dash action, which may not be part of a flurry. The total distance the character travels is quadrupled after all other modifiers, and she cannot be seen or targeted while moving. This Charm's stealth element explicitly fails without provoking a roll-off against effects that would allow others to notice an otherwise perfectly invisible character.</description>

        <description>Putting on a sudden burst of speed, the martial artist melts into a blur as an attack closes in on her, briefly disappearing and reappearing to evade the blow. This Charm sets an incoming attack's successes to 0 in Step Three after all other modifiers. This does mean that rerolls (which occur in Step Four) may allow an attack to bypass this form of defense. This weakness is considered to be a special flaw of invulnerability. Flashing Leaves Evasion does not function against attacks that are undodgeable or unexpected.This Charm is known in Autochthonia as Shadow Among Shadows.</description>

        <description>Subjected to attack, the crystal shatters, wounding its attacker rather than defending itself. This Charm may be invoked in response to an attack, whether it strikes the martial artist or not. The character vanishes in a blur of speed, reappearing behind his attacker. This movement allows for a reflexive attempt to re-establish surprise. This action does not impede resolution of the original attack in any way, and is considered to be a form of counterattack. If the martial artist is the target of a flurry, she may invoke this Charm in response to only the final attack in that flurry.</description>

        <description>Accelerating into a flickering blur of unleashed violence, the Blinding Prism strikes a foe from many angles, moving so fast that her attacks seem to occur simultaneously. The character launches a flurry of (Essence) unarmed attacks at her full dice pool against a single opponent. This flurry ignores Rate and has a total Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest of any single attack in the flurry. These attacks all impose a coordinated attack penalty on the target's DVs equal to the total number of attacks in the flurry.</description>

        <description>The martial artist focuses her Essence into her lungs then breathes it out into her anima, which shivers into a kaleidoscope that expands to intermittently flicker through an area with a radius of (Essence x 50) yards, roughly centered on the martial artist and moving with her. While this emphatically announces the Blinding Prism's general presence, it also conceals her precise location. She becomes invisible, imposing a -2 external penalty on all attempts to precisely locate or target her with attacks. This invisibility fails during any tick when the martial artist attacks, voiding the protection it affords during that moment.</description>

            <description>The odd Arms Of The Unconquered Sun Style dates back to the High First Age. Originally intended as a meditative exercise as much as a fighting art, it was often taught to newly reborn Solars to hasten their mastery of complex Essence workings. Those who sought initiation into Sidereal martial arts considered it a useful bridge toward mastery of those allegorical fighting styles, while the pious enjoyed practicing the forms of the style for devotional purposes.
   This Celestial martial art is little known in the Age of Sorrows. Its scrolls were purged from Creation along with their authors, systematically sought out and destroyed during the Shogunate. Some ancient Lunars remember the style, but few practice it. The only known remaining manuals that fully describe the style are held among the libraries of the Sidereal Exalted, who feared to insult the Unconquered Sun by letting the style fade from existence altogether. And yet, the style might be witnessing a resurgence at last, as new students practice the Forms of the Sun in the training camps of the Cult of the Illuminated.
   Weapons and Armor: Arms of the Unconquered Sun is an unarmed style only, although it does permit practitioners to wear up to medium armor.</description>

        <description>The martial artist makes it certain that she will endure to strike back at an opponent, as surely as day follows the tribulations of the night. Invoked in response to an attack that successfully strikes the character, this Charm does nothing to immediately protect her from the blow, but it does present a formidable defense that keeps further attacks from having any chance of harming her. Invoking this Charm against an attacker renders it impossible for that attacker to direct any subsequent attacks at the martial artist until his (the attacker's) DV refreshes. This is treated as a counterattack, even though the defense is not inherently hostile.</description>

        <description>The key to victory resides in the intent to win. Completely focusing his Essence into an all-or-nothing attack, the martial artist renders an attack unblockable. Yet, he also reduces his DVs to 0 during the tick on which he attacks as a result of this focus.</description>

            <description>The odd Arms Of The Unconquered Sun Style dates back to the High First Age. Originally intended as a meditative exercise as much as a fighting art, it was often taught to newly reborn Solars to hasten their mastery of complex Essence workings. Those who sought initiation into Sidereal martial arts considered it a useful bridge toward mastery of those allegorical fighting styles, while the pious enjoyed practicing the forms of the style for devotional purposes.
   This Celestial martial art is little known in the Age of Sorrows. Its scrolls were purged from Creation along with their authors, systematically sought out and destroyed during the Shogunate. Some ancient Lunars remember the style, but few practice it. The only known remaining manuals that fully describe the style are held among the libraries of the Sidereal Exalted, who feared to insult the Unconquered Sun by letting the style fade from existence altogether. And yet, the style might be witnessing a resurgence at last, as new students practice the Forms of the Sun in the training camps of the Cult of the Illuminated.
   Weapons and Armor: Arms of the Unconquered Sun is an unarmed style only, although it does permit practitioners to wear up to medium armor.</description>

        <description>The spear carried by the Unconquered Sun is a simple weapon, serving only one purpose. But it is also nimble, able to strike down foes from a multitude of angles. In its simplicity, it is a thing of awe and fear. Drawing from this example, the martial artist unleashes a flurry of strikes along many different vectors at a single opponent, each ultimately connecting in the same place. The character makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack at his full dice pool. Should it inflict damage, he immediately follows it up with another attack, and should that also inflict damage, he repeats this sequence until he has either failed to harm his opponent or (Martial Arts + Essence) total attacks have been delivered. Each attack ignores one cumulative point of the target's soak. All attacks are delivered at full dice pool. The flurry ignores Rate and has a total Speed and DV penalty equal to the highest of any individual attack.</description>

        <description>When the Unconquered Sun winds his horn, the unrighteous tremble, feeling their feeble pretensions of strength drain away. This Charm may be invoked in response to an attack, whether it actually strikes the martial artist or not. Stepping forward, he unleashes a powerful and fearful kiai that disrupts his opponent's Essence. The martial artist's player rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts) with a number of bonus successes equal to his Essence and compares it to his attacker's Dodge MDV. Should the total successes exceed that MDV, the target is filled with soul-deep terror. This unnatural mental influence costs three Willpower to resist. If not resisted, the target's DV does not replenish itself upon his next action (though other effects dependent upon his DV refreshing, such as being able to use a new Charm selection, still occur).</description>

        <description>The shield of the Unconquered Sun is used both to catch blows and to batter his enemies. It teaches martial artists to be active even in their passive defenses. A character uses this Charm when he has been subjected to an attack, whether it strikes or not. He steps into the blow, reaching out to remove his foe's ability to fight. The character is given the choice of countering either by launching a disarm attempt with his Martial Arts added in bonus dice, or initiating a clinch with his Essence added in bonus dice.</description>

        <description>The fourth arm of the Unconquered Sun clutches a laurel branch, symbolizing peace and prosperity. It is the prize for which the other arms of the Unconquered Sun strive. Mindful of this lesson, the martial artist imposes peace through any means necessary. Concentrating for a moment and then launching a precise, forceful strike to his opponent's solar plexus, the character disrupts Essence flow through that key meridian. He launches a Martial Arts attack at his full dice pool. Should it inflict any damage, the target suffers a Crippling effect that forces him to add a surcharge equal to his own current wound penalty to the cost of any Essence expenditures he makes for the remainder of the scene.</description>

        <description>As the Unconquered Sun moves naturally from station to station and shifts effortlessly between the faces he shows the world, so too does the martial artist. Utilizing a brief transitional kata called the Steps of Unity, he may reflexively shift between any of the known Form-Type Charms of the Arms Of The Unconquered Sun Style for one mote. This benefit may be used only once per action, and only if the character already has one of the style's Form-Type Charms active. The character continues committing the motes for whichever Form-Type Charm he had originally invoked and does not have to add to this cost, even if the new Form-Type Charm is more expensive. Dropping this commitment will drop whatever Form-Type Charm he has active.</description>

            <name>Arms Of The Unconquered Sun Style</name>
            <description>The odd Arms Of The Unconquered Sun Style dates back to the High First Age. Originally intended as a meditative exercise as much as a fighting art, it was often taught to newly reborn Solars to hasten their mastery of complex Essence workings. Those who sought initiation into Sidereal martial arts considered it a useful bridge toward mastery of those allegorical fighting styles, while the pious enjoyed practicing the forms of the style for devotional purposes.
   This Celestial martial art is little known in the Age of Sorrows. Its scrolls were purged from Creation along with their authors, systematically sought out and destroyed during the Shogunate. Some ancient Lunars remember the style, but few practice it. The only known remaining manuals that fully describe the style are held among the libraries of the Sidereal Exalted, who feared to insult the Unconquered Sun by letting the style fade from existence altogether. And yet, the style might be witnessing a resurgence at last, as new students practice the Forms of the Sun in the training camps of the Cult of the Illuminated.
   Weapons and Armor: Arms of the Unconquered Sun is an unarmed style only, although it does permit practitioners to wear up to medium armor.</description>

        <description>The martial artist relaxes into an easy stance, his attitude leonine in both its regality and vigilance, ready for anything. He reduces all multiple action penalties by one, adds (Essence) to the raw damage of his attacks, and is immune to unnatural mental influence within standard or mass combat time. (This last benefit does not apply to long-tick social or mass social combat).
       More remarkably, the character's watchful attitude and quick adaptation permit him to use the Sun Burning upon the Mirror technique. After observing an opponent taking at least three actions under the effects of a Form-Type Charm, the character may reflexively commit one mote to emulate all benefits of that Charm, including the ability to use in-style weapons with the Martial Arts Ability (though they do not become compatible with other Arms of the Unconquered Sun Charms). The character may emulate only one Form-Type Charm at a time, and he loses the basic benefits of Crowned Sun Form while doing so. All emulated benefits cease to apply should he change to another in-style Form-Type Charm by way of the Heaven-and-Earth Stairway, though they will resume should he return to Crowned Sun Form later in the scene. Characters cannot emulate Form-Type Charms from styles at stations of the Perfected Lotus into which they are unable to be initiated. (For example, a Lunar Exalt or Green Sun Prince could not emulate Charcoal March of Spiders Form).</description>

            <description>The monkey is sharp and clever, sagacious in his simple way. The nimble, quick-witted animal seldom worries about danger and never about failure. Should a snake or tiger come close, the monkey simply jumps to another tree. Should he fail to collect one sweet fruit or shiny trinket, why, there's always another. To envious, ground-bound humans, the monkey seems to live with neither toil nor fear, carefree as the immortal gods.
   These mortals obviously don't know about the laborious bureaucracy of Yu-Shan; many a god would envy a monkey's life as well. Nevertheless, some martial artists draw inspiration from the monkey's careless self-assurance as well as its agility. Students of the Celestial Monkey Style practice acrobatic katas and meditate on jokes and paradoxes. Much of their training centers on acting without conscious thought. Some sages see the impulsive monkey as a symbol of an unfocused, distracted mind but practitioners of this martial art see the monkey as a paragon of quick, flexible response. They all seek to achieve the monkey's happy self-confidence and wide-eyed joy at the world. Those who do so earn the nickname Blissful Sages and become some of the most talented and unsinkable martial artists roaming free across Creation.
    Blissful Sages don't spare much respect for anyone or anything, including themselves. They avoid strong passions that could channel their attention too narrowly. As a result, no Blissful Sage has any Virtue rated higher than 3. A higher rating indicates a degree of obsession that an enemy could exploit or that could distract a practitioner from complete awareness of the world. No character with a Virtue rated 4 or higher can learn this style, and if a Blissful Sage raises one of his Virtues higher than 3, he can no longer use the style's Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: This martial art is an unarmed style only, and characters cannot use this style while wearing armor. Only masters of this style can escape these prohibitions. (See the Charm Celestial Godbody Understanding for details).
   Complementary Skills: Celestial Monkey practitioners do not need specific ratings in other Abilities to learn this martial art. That said, they often develop great skill at Dodge and Athletics for agility, Awareness for comprehensive observation of their surroundings and Integrity for a self-possessed mind that evades outside influences.</description>

        <description>The Exalt can move from a perfectly relaxed pose to strike her opponent unexpectedly, ambushing him despite being in full view. The Charm can be used only before combat starts. When the martial artist activates this Charm and makes a Martial Arts attack, her opponent's player attempts a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll with a difficulty equal to the martial artist's permanent Essence. If this roll fails, the Exalt's opponent cannot apply his Dodge or Parry DV to this attack without the use of reflexive surprise-mitigating Charms. If the roll succeeds, the martial artist's attack roll is subject to the victim's Dodge or Parry DV. Only after the attack granted by this Charm is complete does combat begin, at which point the player of every character involved rolls Join Battle. The Speed of the surprise attack granted by this Charm is not taken into account for the purposes of determining when on the reaction count the martial artist's next action occurs. The result of her Join Battle roll determines her position on the reaction count normally.</description>

        <description>This Charm makes its user frustratingly hard to attack. The Exalt engages his opponent and dances around her like a monkey, moving alternately too close for proper leverage and tantalizingly out of reach in no predictable pattern. This ridiculous capering subtracts two from the Accuracy modifier of the opponent's attack. The Blissful Sage can also attack more quickly, adding his Essence to his Join Battle dice pool at the start of combat and subtracting one tick from the Speed of his attack.</description>

        <description>The Exalt practices a meditative prana for about 20 minutes, channeling powerful Essence. Doing so suffuses her muscles with fluid suppleness, and her bones and skin are fortified with power and flexibility. For the rest of the scene, faint pulses of golden Essence radiate from the martial artist's core chakras in time with her heartbeat, running down her arms and legs and up to the crown chakra in the center of her forehead. The Exalt's caste mark also becomes visible. For every four motes of Essence the martial artist spends, add one temporary dot to her Strength or Stamina; or for every six motes of Essence, add one temporary dot to her Dexterity. Body of War Meditation can be used more than once for the same scene, but it cannot be used once the character enters combat. The effects are cumulative, and the Exalt's Attributes can be raised thus above trait maximums. The character cannot raise any of her Physical Attributes by more dots than she has permanent Essence, however.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the martial artist attacks his opponent's weapon arm in an attempt to disarm him. The Exalt's player rolls a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack at a difficulty of 1, disregarding the standard -2 penalty for attempts to disarm. The target's DV applies as if the attack were a normal one, but the DV suffers a penalty equal to the attacker's permanent Essence.
   If the attacker succeeds, the target's player must attempt a reflexive roll of (Wits + the weapon's pertinent Ability) per the normal rules. If she fails this roll, her weapon is flung a number of yards equal to the martial artist's extra successes. The weapon flies off in a direction of the martial artist's choosing, or the Exalt may take it for himself and pass it to someone else if she pleases.</description>

        <description>The state of careless confidence to which disciples of this style aspire is known as the "Selfless Mind". Practitioners divorce themselves from emotions or other distractions that would undermine their confidence or make them doubt their chances of success or chosen course of action. Celestial Monkey Form is the perfect expression of that ability.
   The martial artist centers herself and spends the motes necessary to fuel the Charm. Her body relaxes as she releases her mind from the expectations of society and her own inner turmoil between emotion and intellect. Free for the time being, the martial artist smiles blissfully. For the rest of the scene, the Exalt does not need to make Virtue tests. Gibbering bands of demon-soldiers will not intimidate her on the battlefield, nor will the feeble pawings of elderly invalids distract her from pursuing her adversary. She also becomes immune to all forms of natural mental influence for the scene, regardless of how compatible such influence might be with her Motivation. Attempts to levy unnatural mental influence suffer a +1 external penalty (where applicable), and the martial artist does not gain Limit from using Willpower to resist.</description>

        <description>By meditating on every aspect of the natural world around them, Blissful Sages can understand the manifold ways Essence flows through Creation. By emulating the phenomena on which they meditate (by walking in the footsteps of ten thousand things), these martial artists guide Creation's Essence to flow through them in the same manifold ways. In so doing, these learned masters perfect their martial skills and make themselves unassailable.
   To use this Charm, a martial artist must first size up his opponent, either by fighting him, watching him demonstrate his style or watching him fight someone else. Studying an opponent in this way requires one full scene of observation. After that fight or period of observation is over, the martial artist then meditates on his opponent for a period of one hour, internalizing the lessons he learned in his observation.
   Henceforth, whenever the martial artist faces that particular opponent, his player rolls (Perception + Martial Arts) with a difficulty equal to that opponent's Martial Arts score. If the roll succeeds, the Blissful Sage adds any successes above that difficulty to his own Martial Arts attacks against that opponent for one scene. If the opponent learns a new martial arts style, however, the Blissful Sage loses this advantage until he spends another scene observing the opponent's new combat techniques and uses this Charm again.</description>

            <description>The monkey is sharp and clever, sagacious in his simple way. The nimble, quick-witted animal seldom worries about danger and never about failure. Should a snake or tiger come close, the monkey simply jumps to another tree. Should he fail to collect one sweet fruit or shiny trinket, why, there's always another. To envious, ground-bound humans, the monkey seems to live with neither toil nor fear, carefree as the immortal gods.
   These mortals obviously don't know about the laborious bureaucracy of Yu-Shan; many a god would envy a monkey's life as well. Nevertheless, some martial artists draw inspiration from the monkey's careless self-assurance as well as its agility. Students of the Celestial Monkey Style practice acrobatic katas and meditate on jokes and paradoxes. Much of their training centers on acting without conscious thought. Some sages see the impulsive monkey as a symbol of an unfocused, distracted mind but practitioners of this martial art see the monkey as a paragon of quick, flexible response. They all seek to achieve the monkey's happy self-confidence and wide-eyed joy at the world. Those who do so earn the nickname Blissful Sages and become some of the most talented and unsinkable martial artists roaming free across Creation.
    Blissful Sages don't spare much respect for anyone or anything, including themselves. They avoid strong passions that could channel their attention too narrowly. As a result, no Blissful Sage has any Virtue rated higher than 3. A higher rating indicates a degree of obsession that an enemy could exploit or that could distract a practitioner from complete awareness of the world. No character with a Virtue rated 4 or higher can learn this style, and if a Blissful Sage raises one of his Virtues higher than 3, he can no longer use the style's Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: This martial art is an unarmed style only, and characters cannot use this style while wearing armor. Only masters of this style can escape these prohibitions. (See the Charm Celestial Godbody Understanding for details).
   Complementary Skills: Celestial Monkey practitioners do not need specific ratings in other Abilities to learn this martial art. That said, they often develop great skill at Dodge and Athletics for agility, Awareness for comprehensive observation of their surroundings and Integrity for a self-possessed mind that evades outside influences.</description>

        <description>Essence flows through all things, and supernatural martial arts provide a way to channel and direct this energy. Just as Essence concentrates in certain geographical nexus points known as demesnes, so too do similar nexus points exist in the body. Blissful Sages pay special attention to four of these chakras, which they call the Gates of Virtue. Celestial Monkey practitioners believe each gate is attuned to one of the Divine Virtues: the Crown of Temperance (head), the Chalice of Compassion (sternum), the Throne of Conviction (stomach) and the Root of Valor (groin). When the martial artist invokes this Charm in combat, she sees glowing rings encircle these gates on her opponent, each of which glows with an intensity proportional to the strength of the corresponding Virtue.
   These rings provide more than knowledge about a foe's personality. The martial artist need only attempt an attack against one of these gates at a +3 external difficulty penalty, rolling damage as usual. If any damage exceeds the target's soak, the target suffers an additional amount of lethal damage equal to the Virtue whose chakra was struck.
    Example: The Blissful Sage Liu fitoys with a very frustrated deathknight who just wants Liu fito succumb to the bleak inevitable. Liu fiopens his mind and perceives the deathknight's four Gates of Virtue, discovering that his opponent is tightly centered around his Throne of Conviction. Liu filands a reverse elbow-strike in the deathknight's gut, inflicting one level of bashing damage over his opponent's soak. The deathknight has a Conviction of 5, however, so he suffers five additional levels of lethal damage. As the deathknight drops to his knees clutching his midsection (thankful he wasn't more brave than sure), Liu fitakes the opportunity to excuse himself.</description>

        <description>This Charm enables a Blissful Sage to manipulate her own Gates of Virtue, moving these nexus points within her frame. Doing so creates glowing, spherical fields of Essence around her body wherever she moves the gates, with a radius equal to the length of his forearm. This realignment causes no disturbance within the martial artist, but those who witness him using this Charm see glittering coronas (colored like the Exalt's anima banner) flare around the Exalt's extremities.
   The martial artist can use these haloes of Essence to parry any incoming attack, hand-to-hand or ranged, using her full (Dexterity + Martial Arts) total as her Defense Value for the scene (not dividing the value by two, per her normal Parry DV). She does not need to move to do so either. The character only needs to be aware of the attacks and have enough Essence and Willpower to activate the Charm.</description>

        <description>Blissful masters of this martial art transcend its limits through their perfected consciousness of how Essence flows through the world and themselves. After buying this Charm, the martial artist treats all attacks made using the Martial Arts Ability as unarmed attacks, even if he uses a weapon - including all the Charms of this style. Wearing armor no longer hinders the character from performing the Charms of this martial art, either. If it matters, any Strength, Dexterity or Martial Arts minimums for the character's weapons are halved (round up), so the Blissful Sage can wield weapons that seem like they should be too heavy for her. (This also helps the character if Charms, drugs or poisons reduce her Attributes below the listed minimums).</description>

            <description>Martial artists who learn the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style become consummate performers with charisma and grace to spare, and they can be as elusive as dreams. They wield desires like swords, and the masters can become things out of nightmare. The style emphasizes finesse and subtle manipulation rather than brute power, and it might have inspired the White Veil Style. (That Terrestrial martial art is much weaker, though).
   Weapons and Armor: Charms in the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style treat attacks made with a whip, weighted rope or rope dart as unarmed attacks. (See the Appendix, pp. 156-157, for the game statistics of rope weapons). Sashes, capes and ball gown trains can be given the properties of weighted ropes through the judicious addition of lead weights concealed in the layers of fabric. Directly examining such items to determine if they are weapons requires a (Perception + Investigation) roll. Doing so while simply looking at the character over requires a (Perception + Awareness) roll, difficulty 3, instead. War fans are also form weapons for the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style.
   Several Charms of this style also enable practitioners to attack using the long, flowing sleeves of their robes or ordinary gown trains, cloaks or sashes, without any preparation. Others permit attacks using ordinary paper fans and similar props. In such cases the martial artist empowers these "weapons" with her Essence. All the damage comes from the Charm.
   Characters cannot use this style while wearing armor.
   Complementary Skills: A prospective Dreaming Pearl Courtesan must have at least two dots in Performance, Presence or Socialize before she can learn this style.</description>

        <description>In the hands of a martial artist using this Charm, a delicate paper fan can be infused with Essence that makes it cut like a razor. The character treats all paper fans (or other similar props such as brushes or mirrors) as wind-fire wheels. She treats all sashes, long hems, sleeves and so on as seven-section staves. The damage these weapons inflict is lethal, though their appearance does not change.
   In addition, if the character uses an actual war fan or other accouterment that has been properly constructed for use in the martial arts, the character may enhance the weapon's Speed, Accuracy, Damage or Defense by an amount equal to her Essence. (Pick any one value upon activating the Charm). If the player picks Speed, a value equal to the character's Essence is subtracted from the weapon's Speed rating. The result of doing so can be no less than 1, however. Sashes, cloak-hems and other clothing turned into weighted ropes and then enhanced by this Charm deal less damage than they would if empowered by the Charm alone - but the character can wield them with much greater Speed, Accuracy or Defense.</description>

        </prerequest>
        <description>The sensual martial artist's props and robes take on a life of their own, enhancing and complementing her movements. At her command, her fans open and swirl enticingly about her body like butterflies. Her sashes tease and coil around her like a lover's hands, and her flowing sleeves and robes writhe and twist at her whim. The Exalt does not have to physically manipulate these props in order to create this effect.
   The martial artist controls one prop per dot of Essence she has (deciding which props to animate when she activates the Charm). For example, an Exalt with an Essence score of 4 could control one fan, one sash, one of her flowing sleeves and the hem of her cloak, or she could control four fans at once. If the martial artist wishes to add or change a prop, she must drop the present invocation of this Charm and reactivate it.
   Objects the martial artist wishes to command must be in her possession, and she cannot make an attack with these props unless she is manually controlling them. To attack with them yet still leave her hands free requires her to use the Flurry of August Leaves Concentration Charm. While her character uses this Charm, the Exalt's player adds her character's Martial Arts score to all Presence and Socialize rolls, including those required for social combat and the activation of Charms.</description>

            <description>Martial artists who learn the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style become consummate performers with charisma and grace to spare, and they can be as elusive as dreams. They wield desires like swords, and the masters can become things out of nightmare. The style emphasizes finesse and subtle manipulation rather than brute power, and it might have inspired the White Veil Style. (That Terrestrial martial art is much weaker, though).
   Weapons and Armor: Charms in the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style treat attacks made with a whip, weighted rope or rope dart as unarmed attacks. (See the Appendix, pp. 156-157, for the game statistics of rope weapons). Sashes, capes and ball gown trains can be given the properties of weighted ropes through the judicious addition of lead weights concealed in the layers of fabric. Directly examining such items to determine if they are weapons requires a (Perception + Investigation) roll. Doing so while simply looking at the character over requires a (Perception + Awareness) roll, difficulty 3, instead. War fans are also form weapons for the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style.
   Several Charms of this style also enable practitioners to attack using the long, flowing sleeves of their robes or ordinary gown trains, cloaks or sashes, without any preparation. Others permit attacks using ordinary paper fans and similar props. In such cases the martial artist empowers these "weapons" with her Essence. All the damage comes from the Charm.
   Characters cannot use this style while wearing armor.
   Complementary Skills: A prospective Dreaming Pearl Courtesan must have at least two dots in Performance, Presence or Socialize before she can learn this style.</description>

        <description>The martial artist with this Charm casts her fans or sashes into the air, making them swoop and slash out at an opponent before obediently returning to her. If she activates this Charm while using the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form, the martial artist can have as many props as that Charm allows make multiple attacks against one target. This Charm allows the martial artist to strike a target up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards away.
   The Exalt's player rolls a single normal Martial Arts attack, regardless of how many weapons the character controls. Successes from the roll, penalized by the target's DV, apply to all weapons simultaneously, and the damage is calculated normally as if she had performed the attack manually. The opponent does suffer an onslaught penalty to his DV for being attacked by multiple props, but each prop applies its damage separately.
    Botched attacks can result in broken or lost props, if not injury to the martial artist who cast them. Also, this Charm can be used only on props that can be separated from the Exalt's body. (She can't lash out at a target 25 yards away with the hem of her ball gown, for instance, unless she's wearing one damn long train).</description>

        <description>The Exalt's flowing sashes, hems, sleeves or what have you act with an uncanny dexterity to grapple opponents and their weapons. After successfully dodging or otherwise negat-ing an enemy's attack, the Exalt's player may make a reflexive (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll to have his character's cloak or flowing sleeves snare her opponent's attacking weapon or appendage.
   In order to make a successful retaliatory grapple, the martial artist must score as many successes as his opponent did on her attack. The defender may evade this attack only with Charms or as part of a flurry on her same action. (An opponent is unlikely to call for such a flurry unless she has already seen the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan use this Charm in a previous action, however). If the martial artist's opponent uses a weapon and the martial artist scores three more successes than his opponent's relevant weapon Ability, the martial artist may disarm the target rather than clinching her.
   After successfully clinching his enemy, the martial artist's player attempts a resisted roll of (Dexterity + Martial Arts) against the opponent's (Strength + [Melee or Martial Arts]). The normal grappling rules still apply. If the Exalt uses the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form when activating this Charm, he may attempt as many of these reflexive grapples with animated sashes or trailing robe hems as that Charm allows him to animate. If the martial artist grapples his opponent with a prop animated by that Form-type Charm, turning the tables on the grapple in the subsequent resisted roll does not grant the opponent any control over the martial artist. Instead, she'll just be left holding a limp sash or a ripped-off piece of a loose sleeve. The cost of this Charm must be spent for each reflexive grapple the Exalt attempts.</description>

        <description>An uncomfortable truth written down by a vindictive concubine can wound a person more deeply than any weapon. It slips past his defenses and cuts him where it can deal the most damage. As is true in social situations, so also in the martial arts.
    Even the heaviest of superheavy plate armor has thin seams where the pieces join. A skilled craftsman will minimize the width of these seams so that no blade or arrowhead can pierce them, but even such seams are chasms to the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan who employs paper and silk - thinner than even the sharpest blade. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt negates an amount of her opponent's armor soak equal to her (Essence + Martial Arts) as her unconventional weapons capitalize on the armor's nigh-invisible chinks. This effect does not affect the armor's Hardness value or negate her target's natural soak or any bonuses gained through the use of Charms.</description>

        <description>As the Exalt performs the sultry, languid moves of this Charm, ethereal music whispers in the air, and flower petals flow from her sleeves and the folds of her robes to swirl around her. The martial artist's player rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts), and the players of all those within a number of yards equal to the Exalt's Essence must compare the result to their characters' Dodge MDV. Those whose MDVs do not negate the successes on the martial artist's player's roll find their characters transfixed in place, enraptured by the beauty of the kata and perfume of the petals. Even those in range of this Charm who are not entranced experience a hallucinogenic vertigo, suffering an internal penalty equal to the Exalt's Essence to all dice pools.
   Targets who are entranced believe whatever the Exalt tells them. The Exalt can issue commands to those enraptured and expect them to be followed, regardless of the victim's Intimacies or Motivation. (The victim safely ignores suicidal orders). This Charm does not affect characters with a higher permanent Essence than the martial artist, though. If the Exalt halts her kata for any reason, or if the scene ends, the fascination slowly wears off. In ongoing combat, the effects linger for a number of actions equal to the martial artist's Essence. During this waning period, the victims suffer an internal penalty equal to the Exalt's Essence to all dice pools. Enraptured victims retain vague memories of what they did under the effects of this Charm and suffer a strange melancholy afterward, imposing a -1 internal penalty to Conviction rolls for a number of days equal to the Exalt's Essence.</description>

        <description>, Masters of this style achieve a perfect waking and lucid union of timeless dream and finite self. With this Charm, the martial artist opens herself to Creation's collective dreaming consciousness and assumes the form of the fell and beautiful Chimera. Swirling light shines down upon the Exalt. Her clothes and accouterments merge with her body as her form extends to five times her normal height. Her neck grows up to four feet in length and supports a delicate and golden-beaked foal's head. Four sets of spiraling gazelle's horns adorn her head, reshaping themselves like tendrils of smoke. Many eyes line either side of her narrow snout and continue down her back - ranging from the size of small pearls to the size of goose eggs. They alternately blaze like sapphires in the noonday sun and blink demurely.
   Gold-veined pearl scales cover the Exalt's entire form, providing an additional 6L/12B armor. Instead of arms or legs, the martial artist floats just above the ground on a pair of four-foot-wide carp fins for every dot of Essence she has. These fins enable her to hover in or swim through the air with serpentine grace at 45 miles per hour. (These fins also provide a +3 bonus to Damage). While using this Charm, the Exalt cannot be surprised or lied to, as secrets echo on the wind for her alone and others' intentions play out like uncoiling prayer strips in her mind's eye. Also, the Exalt can perform a number of actions per "actual" action equal to her Essence. (Each "actual" action taken thus is Speed 6). These granted actions are full extra actions, not parts of a flurry, though any of them can also be subdivided into a flurry. This Charm is incompatible with other extra-action Charms.
   This Charm lasts for as long as the Exalt wishes, and she must spend a point of temporary Willpower to end it. Invoking it is risky, how-ever. A martial artist who learns this Charm comes dangerously close to the Blossom of the Perfected Lotus, without necessarily the wisdom to control such esoteric forces. The Exalt thrills to an ecstatic bliss in this form, and many who have done so forgot they were once mortal. For every additional scene her character remains in this form, the player must make a Willpower roll with a cumulative +1 difficulty modifier. If she fails this roll at any time, the character disappears in a blinding flash of pearlescent light, never to be seen again except in fragmentary, half-remembered dreams.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal archives in Yu-Shan say a Night Caste Solar called Ebon Shadow's Graceful Daughter - Shadow's Grace for short - brought this martial art to Creation. Shadow's Grace did not quite believe she deserved the power the Unconquered Sun gave her. She had not fought in the Primordial War, inheriting her power instead when a greater hero fell in that conflict's final battle. Life as a spy and assas-sin, maintaining the peace of the fledgling Old Realm, did not suit her; she thought the Eclipse Caste better suited her temperament. She prayed daily, begging the Unconquered Sun to change either her caste or her spirit. He knew better and ignored her pleas: The needs of peace do not match those of war. He wanted an assassin who would not enjoy her job too much.
   Yet, some-one heard the prayers of Shadow's Grace. One Calibration, she rose from prayer to find a mighty figure before her: four-armed like the Unconquered Sun, but glittering in shades of darkness. Five Days Darkness, the first shadow cast by the Unconquered Sun, offered to teach her a regimen of exercises and meditations that would resolve her doubts and make her truly the Queen of Night. In return, she would share his teachings with other Exalted. She would also swear on her soul to perform one service in each incarnation at her divine sifu's request without question. So desperate was Shadow's Grace to quiet the turmoil within her heart that she accepted the dark god's terms. She absorbed her sifu's teachings before the end of that very Calibration and took the name by which she is remembered in Heaven.
   The archives say Shadow's Grace became a paragon of her caste who taught evildoers to jump at shadows and gave restitution to their victims. Her service to Five Days Darkness is not known.

        <description>Withdrawing her Essence deep into her body, the character drops to the ground and temporarily appears to be dead. A careful examination and a successful (Perception + Medicine) roll, difficulty 3, is necessary to determine that the character is actually still alive. The martial artist using this Charm can hold her breath 10 times as long as normal, and she does not need to eat or drink - handy if she's hiding from enemies at the bottom of a river or wants them to think they killed her. Although the character's senses of hearing, touch and smell function normally, she cannot see or move. She can act normally the action after she chooses to end this Charm.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal archives in Yu-Shan say a Night Caste Solar called Ebon Shadow's Graceful Daughter - Shadow's Grace for short - brought this martial art to Creation. Shadow's Grace did not quite believe she deserved the power the Unconquered Sun gave her. She had not fought in the Primordial War, inheriting her power instead when a greater hero fell in that conflict's final battle. Life as a spy and assas-sin, maintaining the peace of the fledgling Old Realm, did not suit her; she thought the Eclipse Caste better suited her temperament. She prayed daily, begging the Unconquered Sun to change either her caste or her spirit. He knew better and ignored her pleas: The needs of peace do not match those of war. He wanted an assassin who would not enjoy her job too much.
   Yet, some-one heard the prayers of Shadow's Grace. One Calibration, she rose from prayer to find a mighty figure before her: four-armed like the Unconquered Sun, but glittering in shades of darkness. Five Days Darkness, the first shadow cast by the Unconquered Sun, offered to teach her a regimen of exercises and meditations that would resolve her doubts and make her truly the Queen of Night. In return, she would share his teachings with other Exalted. She would also swear on her soul to perform one service in each incarnation at her divine sifu's request without question. So desperate was Shadow's Grace to quiet the turmoil within her heart that she accepted the dark god's terms. She absorbed her sifu's teachings before the end of that very Calibration and took the name by which she is remembered in Heaven.
   The archives say Shadow's Grace became a paragon of her caste who taught evildoers to jump at shadows and gave restitution to their victims. Her service to Five Days Darkness is not known. She died before the Usurpation, trying to kill a mad Solar tyrant. The Sidereals are fairly sure the Solar who inherited her Exaltation perished in the Usurpation. Now, her Exaltation is free from the Jade Prison, but its current host is unknown. Where is the inheritor of Shadow's Grace? And what will Five Days Darkness demand of her?

        <description>The character using this Charm can move or dash along walls, ropes, hanging chains and other vertical surfaces as easily as he can walk along a floor. Using this Charm, the character can climb a surface simply by running up it, without halving his base movement rate. In his next action, the character must either activate the Charm again, remain where he is (if he's made it to a ledge or suitable hand - and footholds) or attempt to leap or climb down normally.</description>

        <description>The Ebon Shadow martial artist makes a complex, Essence-charged sign with her fingers, and the twisting lines of shadowy Essence distract and slow one selected opponent. The sign takes only an instant to make at the beginning of the action. The target character's next action is delayed for a number of ticks equal to the martial artist's Martial Arts score, incidentally preventing his DV from refreshing until then. When the target's next action comes, he cannot perform a flurry but may still use Combos and reflexive and extra action Charms normally. He can perform a Guard action as usual.</description>

        <description>Although the Exalt's body does not become indistinct or drink in light like a true shadow, he still moves with the eerie speed and grace of a candle-wavering silhouette. While using this Charm, the character adds his Martial Arts score to his Join Battle dice pool. He also adds a value equal to his Essence to his Stealth score and his Dodge DV. When the character makes a Martial Arts attack (with hands, feet, sais or fighting chains), he can inflict either bashing or lethal damage at will. If a character using this Charm is killed before the duration expires, his body dissipates into thick black smoke. He leaves no ghost, and his physical remains provide no evidence of his identity (though his gear might).</description>

        <description>The character's Essence guides her attack to the weakest point in her target's armor. Subtract the character's Martial Arts rating from the targeted armor's relevant soak (based on what type of damage the character inflicts) before calculating the attack's final damage. This Charm does not affect the armor's Hardness, a target's intrinsic soak or defense granted by Charms.
   Seven Points of Weakness Strike provides no benefit against a target who does not wear any armor. After all, a weak point in a suit of armor would not be in the same region of a target's body, which makes the angle of approach and attack completely different.</description>

        <description>With the slightest touch, like a shadow falling on bare skin, the martial artist immobilizes one of his target's limbs. The character need simply touch an unsuspecting foe, though his attempt to do so can be blocked or dodged as normal. The attacker chooses which limb to paralyze - not necessarily the one he touched - and the chosen limb is immobilized for the rest of the scene. See Exalted, p. 152 for the effects on a character who lacks a full set of functioning limbs. Since most people don't keep a crutch handy, the player of a target with a paralyzed leg must also attempt a reflexive (Dexterity + Athletics) roll for her character to maintain her balance every time that character is struck. Characters with both legs immobilized must generally perform stunts to attack or even guard. Immobilizing an arm keeps the target from using that arm to attack - which can be devastating if the victim is an archer.
   This attack has no effect against the undead, automata or other beings that have no vital functions to obstruct.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, a character can stun or incapacitate a target with a precise strike to one of five vital nerve clusters. To do so, the character lightly taps the target on one of several possible nerve points, using a jolt of her own Essence to disrupt the Essence flowing through the spot and confuse the target's nerves. This (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack inflicts no dam-age, but the Exalt's player rolls a number of dice equal to her character's (Martial Arts + the number of extra successes she made on the attack) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Each extra success the player rolls above the difficulty reduces the target's Dexterity by one dot for the scene. If the target's Dexterity drops to 0, he is paralyzed.
   The effect of this Charm can be mitigated if the player of a character with Medicine and Martial Arts at 3 or higher succeeds at a (Wits + Martial Arts) roll, difficulty 3, to restore the proper flow of Essence through the victim's body. Removing paralysis is a simple action (Speed 6), and the target can move normally on his next action. With a successful (Wits + Stealth) roll, difficulty 1, this touch can be disguised as an amiable nudge or unintentional jostling in a crowd. This attack cannot be used against the undead, automata or other beings that lack vital centers.</description>

One Calibration, she rose from prayer to find a mighty figure before her: four-armed like the Unconquered Sun, but glittering in shades of darkness. Five Days Darkness, the first shadow cast by the Unconquered Sun, offered to teach her a regimen of exercises and meditations that would resolve her doubts and make her truly the Queen of Night. In return, she would share his teachings with other Exalted. She would also swear on her soul to perform one service in each incarnation at her divine sifu's request without question. So desperate was Shadow's Grace to quiet the turmoil within her heart that she accepted the dark god's terms. She absorbed her sifu's teachings before the end of that very Calibration and took the name by which she is remembered in Heaven.
   The archives say Shadow's Grace became a paragon of her caste who taught evildoers to jump at shadows and gave restitution to their victims. Her service to Five Days Darkness is not known. She died before the Usurpation, trying to kill a mad Solar tyrant. The Sidereals are fairly sure the Solar who inherited her Exaltation perished in the Usurpation. Now, her Exaltation is free from the Jade Prison, but its current host is unknown. Where is the inheritor of Shadow's Grace? And what will Five Days Darkness demand of her?

        <description>One could more easily weigh smoke than strike a character who uses this Charm. Until the martial artist's next action, add his Essence to his Dodge DV. The Ebon Shadow Stylist need not even be in combat when he activates this Charm. For instance, he may use the Charm to dodge the poisoned darts of an automatic trap in the tomb of his First Age incarnation. Should the character use this Charm outside combat, all dodge attempts - including those involving Charms whose effects continue from previous actions - gain additional bonus dice equal to her Essence for one action (which can raise the total bonus above the standard maximums). If some internal or external penalty would normally reduce the character's Dodge pool or DV to 0, using this Charm reflexively provides a base value equal to the character's Essence.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal archives in Yu-Shan say a Night Caste Solar called Ebon Shadow's Graceful Daughter - Shadow's Grace for short - brought this martial art to Creation. Shadow's Grace did not quite believe she deserved the power the Unconquered Sun gave her. She had not fought in the Primordial War, inheriting her power instead when a greater hero fell in that conflict's final battle. Life as a spy and assas-sin, maintaining the peace of the fledgling Old Realm, did not suit her; she thought the Eclipse Caste better suited her temperament. She prayed daily, begging the Unconquered Sun to change either her caste or her spirit. He knew better and ignored her pleas: The needs of peace do not match those of war.

        <description>The character makes an arcane silent-communication gesture once used by teams of Night Caste scouts on long-range patrols in the First Age and infuses the gesture with Essence. In so doing, she renders her opponent unable to notice or react to an attack she makes. The opponent cannot apply either of his DVs against the character's blow without the use of reflexive Charms that enhance DV. The target's player may attempt a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) when the target is attacked - the difficulty equals the attacker's Essence. If the roll succeeds, the opponent may use any reflexive Charms or abilities he possesses to counter the attack. If the roll fails, the opponent may use only Charms that specifically state they work on attacks of which the character is unaware. Blow-Concealing Gesture Technique is particularly effective in a Combo with other attack Charms, since the victim doesn't notice the attacker's flaring anima (though people nearby probably will).</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the character takes on the true form of a shadow. The character becomes tenebrous and indistinct, a form of tangible darkness. His flattened body slides through any space wide enough for him to fit his fingers through. Identifying the character while he uses this Charm is extremely difficult. His physical features and clothing give no clues, but the outlines of distinctive gear might give him away. If his anima banner activates, only his caste mark shines. Even his fully iconic anima banner seems shapeless and dark.
   When using this Charm, the Exalt adds his permanent Essence to both his bashing and lethal soaks. Shadow-Body Style does not stack with any other Charms that increase the character's natural soak and have durations longer than instant. This Charm allows a character to see as easily in total darkness as in light, though he must actually use his eyes to see. That is, he cannot see through smoke, murky water or the like just because it also happens to be dark where he is.</description>

        <description>By using this Charm, the martial artist slides into one shadow and almost instantly emerges from another shadow near her destination. The Exalt must have a shadow to step into, and she must have somehow seen her destination be-fore. She emerges in the nearest unobserved shadow near her intended destination one action after she slips away. That destination cannot be more than a number of miles away equal to her Essence. If there are no unobserved shadows within 100 yards of that location, the Charm fails. (The Essence and Willpower are still spent, though).
   Generally, this Charm cannot penetrate the manse of a sorcerer, a god's sanctum or any other such forbidden place. If a place is warded to block teleportation, it stops this Charm from working. Most of the time, if the Charm does not work due to environmental factors or sorcerous warding, the Exalt simply fails to descend into the inky blackness of the entry shadow that she chose. Should an Exalt attempt to use this Charm and fail during Calibration, however, she sinks into a shadow and emerges alone within the Labyrinth instead.</description>

            <description>The Deathlord called the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears invented the Laughing Wounds Style for her deathknight slaves. Its practitioners tend to make very specifically aimed attacks, always intending to cause more torment than physical harm. Abyssal students of the martial art regularly endure terrifying agony - sometimes self-inflicted - to truly internalize the philosophy of the style. They must face their fears and pleasures until their hearts cannot be touched. If a student particularly cares for anyone, her sifu mandates that she watch him without flinching as he is tortured for hours or days on end... or even that she torture him herself. Students learn that pain is their only steadfast love. They ought not only to love it in return, but teach it to others, and teach it well.
   Laughing Wounds Style has proven so useful to the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears and to her followers that they have traded it to other Deathlords and Abyssals in exchange for other rare styles, favors or small concessions. It has become something approaching popular (for an admittedly small audience). Even a few Celestial Exalts - including a Sidereal researcher from the Convention on the Deathlords, which tries to watch all new developments in that area - have learned the Laughing Wounds Style from the servants of Oblivion, though most are too ashamed to admit it.
   Weapons and Armor: Abyssals who know the Laughing Wounds Style can fight unarmed, but most prefer to wield exquisite whips or slender soulsteel fighting chains granted by their Deathlord masters. Necromantically inclined students can even learn a spell to extrude a whip from their own blood, and these Exalts sometimes slash their own wrists before a battle in order to do so.
   Characters cannot use this style while wearing armor. Small, strategically place bits of metal and leather are quite all right, though. Indeed, dedicated practitioners sometimes wear nothing else.</description>

        <description>With a predatory smile, the martial artist lashes her foe with vicious exactitude, making him cry out in shocked agony. On a successful attack, the character may add an extra -1 to her target's wound penalty for the rest of the scene. Kiss of the Whip can be used more than once per target, but the cumulative addition to wound penalty can never rise above an amount equal to the martial artist's Martial Arts score. Therefore, an Abyssal with Martial Arts 5 whose target was at a -2 wound penalty already could not inflict a greater total wound penalty than -7.
    Because she is accustomed to her own methods, the character cannot use this Charm on herself.</description>

        <description>Even as blood runs down his skin, the Abyssal laughs savagely, whirling undaunted through the battle like a scar-let-streaked demon. When he is injured, his wound penalty is reversed. Instead of subtracting, it adds a number of dice equal to the penalty to every combat-related roll his player attempts, to a maximum bonus equal to his Essence score. Even Virtue bonuses are affected, so the player adds those same bonus dice to the number of dice he receives when he channels Willpower through his Conviction, Temperance and Valor. (He must subtract them from any Compassion bonuses, though). The Laughing Wounds Style martial artist also adds his Martial Arts to his raw bashing damage.</description>

        <description>The proper application of pain swiftly teaches weaklings how to serve. The martial artist spends three motes and gives an order while she attacks. If the attack succeeds, compare the target's Dodge MDV to his total wound penalty (including any penalties inflicted by Kiss of the Whip). If the target's total wound penalty exceeds his Dodge MDV, then he must obey the command unless he spends a Willpower point. Furthermore, his new master may set a signal to her authority - cracking her whip, for example. If the target succumbed to the martial artist's first application of Instructive Punishment Method, and she later gives that signal to him again, then he must act upon the earlier instruction once more.
       People the Abyssal has enslaved cannot resist her without suffering certain consequences. As long as a target obeyed the first order, he must expend two Willpower points to resist any subsequent applications of the same command. If he does resist, he suffers a number of health levels of bashing damage equal to the martial artist's Essence for his defiance. (The target character need pay this price only once per scene, however, even if he disobeys the martial artist more than once. As with all unnatural mental influences, an Exalt gains one point of Limit for resisting). Once the victim goes against his owner's will a number of times equal to said owner's Appearance, he overcomes that particular use of Instructive Punishment Method.
   A person can have a maximum of five commands implanted in him at once, but subsequent uses of Instructive Punishment Method may overlap to extend a given command's duration.</description>

            <description>The Deathlord called the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears invented the Laughing Wounds Style for her deathknight slaves. Its practitioners tend to make very specifically aimed attacks, always intending to cause more torment than physical harm. Abyssal students of the martial art regularly endure terrifying agony - sometimes self-inflicted - to truly internalize the philosophy of the style. They must face their fears and pleasures until their hearts cannot be touched. If a student particularly cares for anyone, her sifu mandates that she watch him without flinching as he is tortured for hours or days on end... or even that she torture him herself. Students learn that pain is their only steadfast love. They ought not only to love it in return, but teach it to others, and teach it well.
       Laughing Wounds Style has proven so useful to the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears and to her followers that they have traded it to other Deathlords and Abyssals in exchange for other rare styles, favors or small concessions. It has become something approaching popular (for an admittedly small audience). Even a few Celestial Exalts - including a Sidereal researcher from the Convention on the Deathlords, which tries to watch all new developments in that area - have learned the Laughing Wounds Style from the servants of Oblivion, though most are too ashamed to admit it.

        <description>The martial artist truly owns his pathetic disciples and can mark them as his if he deems them worthy. The Laughing Wounds Style martial artist can spend four motes and one Willpower to initiate a normal attack that, if successful, inflicts only one health level of damage. The damage is aggravated, however, and the heat of the wound rises to the skin in a glowing black brand. This brand does not disappear until the target completely heals the damage, and the damage cannot begin to heal until the Abyssal releases the Essence committed to this Charm.
   As the character beats his servant, the player rolls (Appearance + Martial Arts + Essence) against the target's Dodge MDV. If he succeeds, the target is considered to be under a Servitude effect with regard to him (as detailed on p. 179 of Exalted). Until the brand vanishes, she is his willing thrall.
   If the target wants to go against the martial artist's will, she must expend three Willpower points each time. Otherwise, the victim cannot break the character's hold unless he tries to make her oppose something she truly cares for. If the Abyssal orders her to go against an Intimacy or Motivation, the victim may spend one Willpower to force a reroll of the original (Appearance + Martial Arts + Essence) roll, with her Dodge MDV modified for the Intimacy or Motivation as per Exalted, p. 172. On a failure, the Brand of Obedience ceases to function. Even if the martial artist succeeds, his hold over his thrall breaks if the target can force the reroll three times in one scene.</description>

        <description>Grinning as black bruises darken her skin, the martial artist has a greater appetite for pain than she expects even from her slaves. She cannot be brought to Incapacitated with bashing damage, and any bashing damage sustained after she takes her last -4 health level does not roll over into lethal - indeed, it does not register at all. She can, however, still use Sensuous Torment to gain Essence from the pain.</description>

        <description>The most terrible wounds mean less than nothing to the Abyssal. He only laughs as blood is ripped from his flesh and comes forward hungrily for more. Whenever he would normally take damage, the martial artist can spend four motes for the player to roll (Stamina + Martial Arts), adding the character's Essence in automatic successes but suffering an external penalty equal to the number of health levels the character suffered in the attack. If the roll succeeds, the physical wound remains but the Abyssal has taken no actual damage. (The "faux" injury remains until the end of the scene, when it heals).</description>

        <description>People restrained by the martial artist find themselves unwilling to break free. The character may apply this Charm to any clinch attack. If the character succeeds, then - as long as she maintains the mote commitment - her target no longer truly wants to free himself from her grip. The target must spend one Willpower just for his player to attempt the roll to gain control of the clinch, and the roll takes the Abyssal's Appearance as an internal penalty. If the target intends to use control of the clinch to do anything other than break free - such as crush the Abyssal or hold her helpless - then he need not spend Willpower or take the penalty.</description>

        <description>Daring to oppose a master of the Laughing Wounds Style is like begging for humiliation. On a successful attack, the Abyssal may spend four motes to force her enemy's immediate submission. The target's player rolls (Stamina + Integrity) with an external penalty of the Abyssal's Martial Arts. If the roll fails, the target falls to his knees and cannot move from that spot unless the martial artist releases him. She can stalk around him, chiding, mocking and beating him as she wishes. Since her victim can't stand or shift his legs, he cannot use his Dodge DV at all. Any physical action he manages to take suffers a -2 external penalty, and his Parry DV decreases by two. The target may spend a Willpower point for a (Stamina + Integrity) reroll, but if he fails again, he remains at the martial artist's mercy.</description>

        <description>Shaping her lips into a kiss, the martial artist leans forward and strokes her foe's chest. Then, with a grinning snarl, she plunges her hand through his ribs and rips out his heart. Ravishing the Unworthy Heart enables the character to attempt a normal Martial Arts attack. The attack deals lethal damage, and if it inflicts at least one level of damage, the Charm allows the player to roll (Strength + Martial Arts) with an external penalty of half the target's (Stamina + Resistance + Essence - wound penalties). Success on this roll indicates that the Abyssal holds her victim's life in her palm. She may use her power to further abuse him, or she may put his heart back in his chest. In that case, the gaping hole heals over instantly, leaving a dark scar in the shape of her personal brand.
   While holding her wretched enemy's heart, the martial artist may use any Charms of this style upon him reflexively and as if her victim had no Defense Value (physical or mental). She may also simply crush his heart, in which case she can use a miscellaneous action to inflict - not roll, inflict - a number of health levels of lethal damage equal to (her Strength x 2). This damage goes straight through the heart to the target and can only be soaked with his natural lethal soak. Once the victim dies, his heart has been entirely destroyed.
   The master may have total control over her slave, but her power comes with a measure of responsibility. As long as the character has not either destroyed her target's heart or replaced it in his chest, she must keep the Essence committed to this Charm.</description>

            <description>The deceptive and deadly mantis combines patience with haste. She seems remote, though approachable in her stillness. Her small, precise movements seem too small to warn of any danger. When her prey comes too close, how-ever, the mantis strikes with incredible speed and savage strength. Martial artists who emulate the mantis use small, irregular steps forward, back and side to side to break their opponent's rhythm while holding their hands poised, giving no clue when they intend to strike. When the opponent momentarily moves too close and off balance, the Mantis stylist traps him in a dread embrace. Mantis Style includes lightning-fast chops and punches, but its greatest strength lies in blocking attacks and disarming or disabling a foe without killing him. There's plenty of time to slay a helpless foe, if that becomes necessary...
       Mantis Style is exceedingly ancient. It certainly dates back to the first Celestial Exalted and the war against the Primordials. The wisest of the Sidereal Exalted and the gods (except for perhaps the Maiden of Secrets) do not know who invented it.
   Weapons and Armor: A Mantis combatant can use any martial arts weapon with this style, but it is most commonly practiced either unarmed or with a seven-section staff or serpent-sting staff. Wearing any sort of armor blocks the use of Mantis Style.</description>

        <description>When the character leaps up or toward her opponent, add her Martial Arts score to her Join Battle dice pool, as well as to the maximum number of yards she can leap. This Charm must be activated before the character's player rolls her Join Battle action, and (as normal) the character can jump only once per action. At any time in a fight, the character may add her Martial Arts in yards to her Move.</description>

            <description>The deceptive and deadly mantis combines patience with haste. She seems remote, though approachable in her stillness. Her small, precise movements seem too small to warn of any danger. When her prey comes too close, how-ever, the mantis strikes with incredible speed and savage strength. Martial artists who emulate the mantis use small, irregular steps forward, back and side to side to break their opponent's rhythm while holding their hands poised, giving no clue when they intend to strike. When the opponent momentarily moves too close and off balance, the Mantis stylist traps him in a dread embrace. Mantis Style includes lightning-fast chops and punches, but its greatest strength lies in blocking attacks and disarming or disabling a foe without killing him. There's plenty of time to slay a helpless foe, if that becomes necessary...
       Mantis Style is exceedingly ancient. It certainly dates back to the first Celestial Exalted and the war against the Primordials. The wisest of the Sidereal Exalted and the gods (except for perhaps the Maiden of Secrets) do not know who invented it.
   Weapons and Armor: A Mantis combatant can use any martial arts weapon with this style, but it is most commonly practiced either unarmed or with a seven-section staff or serpent-sting staff. Wearing any sort of armor blocks the use of Mantis Style.</description>

From this position, he can add his Martial Arts score to his Parry DV for one action, either unarmed or with a martial arts weapon. He can also parry attacks that would inflict lethal damage while he's unarmed.</description>

        <description>The character adopts the stance of a mantis, keeping her legs bent and her center of gravity low as she watches her enemy with an unfeeling disregard. In this posture, she adds her Martial Arts score to her Join Battle dice pool and to her bashing and lethal soak. She may parry lethal attacks without having to rely on a stunt. As long as she wields a martial arts weapon or fights barehanded, she does not suffer onslaught penalties to her DV when another character uses a flurry to attack her. (She still suffers the penalties for coordinated attacks, though). The character's unarmed Martial Arts attacks also inflict lethal damage.</description>

        <description>When a foe successfully attacks the Mantis martial artist (i.e., her Dodge or Parry DV does not remove enough successes from the attack roll), the martial artist may activate this Charm and immediately attempt to parry the attack with her (Dexterity + Martial Arts) pool. That is, her player rolls this pool and compares the number of successes to the total number of successes her opponent's attack roll garnered. If this active parry's roll results in an equal or greater number of successes than the attack roll did, the attack inflicts no damage and the character's opponent is trapped in a hold. Use the character's net success as the extra successes on the hold attempt.</description>

            <description>The Solar martial artist who originally developed this style in the First Age gave it no name. He rarely spoke to anyone who was not a member of his circle or one of his students, preferring to let his flame weapons talk for him. Those fearsome weapons levied harsh judgment on the wicked for centuries, offering no explanations and no mercy. And for every depraved abomination the Solar's flames scoured from Creation, the Unconquered Sun granted him more power. Mortals and Exalted alike knew well enough of his deeds to respect and fear the Nameless Solar. To the wicked, he was the Pitiless Devil, who measured their lives on the unforgiving Azure Abacus. To the innocent, he was the Blind Exemplar, whose eyes could not see the just. To his few select students, he was the Righteous Master, who could not rest while evil dwelled within Creation. Only the members of his original circle ever knew his real name, and he destroyed them every one when they fell from the path of righteousness.
   The martial art this paragon developed vanished entirely from Creation at the time of the Usurpation. When the Nameless Solar realized what horrors most of his Solar compatriots had become, he gathered all of his students together at his obsidian temple manse, in Far Southern deserts since claimed by the Wyld. There, he passed judgment on the entirety of his fallen Solar ilk and expressed it by exterminating all of his students. When none remained, he destroyed himself in one last conflagration of firedust and burning Essence.
   Only in the most recent years have any of his students been reborn. Some of them remember the discipline required to wield their master's purifying flame. Some of them also remember the awful holocaust their master visited upon them. Was he righteous or mad? They cannot say.
   The few who remember the Nameless Solar's martial art teach it or practice it in solitude now, like the taciturn master they now remember only as the Righteous Devil. As for the soul and Exaltation of that master... both remain unaccounted for in both Creation and in the Underworld, and even the wisest in Yu-Shan do not know their fates.
   Weapons and Armor: The Charms of this style can be used only with firewands or other flame-discharge weapons. Armor does not hinder the practice of this style, though some Devils believe their righteousness is all the protection they need.
   Complementary Abilities: An Exalt must possess at least two dots of Archery before he can learn this martial art. Most practitioners keep their Archery rating at least as high as their Martial Arts (if only so they can Combo the style's Charms with powerful Archery Charms).</description>

        <description>The character extends her senses to feel the flow of Essence that connects her weapon to her target. That fine line of possibility between the Righteous Devil and her target flares up invisibly in anticipation of the martial artist's shot firing true. For each mote of Essence spent, the player may reduce the number of ticks it takes to complete an Aim action, though she may not reduce that action's Speed to less than 1 (see Exalted, p. 142). If the Exalt covers targets with successive Aim actions, the player must pay the mote cost anew for each successive action whose Speed she wishes to reduce.
   If the player spends three motes to activate this Charm, she gets a slightly different effect. She still takes an Aim ac-tion, but when she does, the flare-up of Essence that connects her weapon to its target actually burns the target. This burn consumes none of the weapon's firedust ammunition, nor does it require the character actually to discharge the weapon. The effect inflicts no damage on a target other than to mark him with a black circle no larger than half an inch in diameter. With a called shot, the character can use this effect to disarm an opponent by burning his exposed fingers or to ignite a highly flammable substance (such as exposed firedust). Doing so requires a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll as normal, with an internal penalty commensurate with the complexity of the called shot. (See p. 158 of Exalted for the rules on called shots). The roll does benefit from the bonus dice gained from the Aim action, though, as well as any appropriate stunt dice. If the player spends three motes to use the Charm for this purpose, the Aim action takes its full three ticks. If she spends only one or two motes, all she does is decrease the amount of time it takes to complete the Aim action.</description>

        <description>This Charm increases the damage the Righteous Devil's weapon can inflict. The character draws a breath and concentrates before firing his weapon. When he does, the stream of flame expands to twice its normal girth, dramatically flaring out from its center in a spiral of fiery Essence. The Essence-augmented blast doubles the raw damage of a successful Martial Arts attack using a firewand or similar weapon.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the martial artist need not have her weapon in hand before Join Battle is rolled to use it. Vibrant bands of crackling Essence coalesce about her forearms, and the Exalt readies her firewand and fires it all in the same action (without suffering the -1 DV penalty normally as-sociated with readying a weapon). Aside from the surprise factor this Charm allows, it also enables the character to attack more quickly, adding one extra automatic success to her Join Battle roll per dot of Essence she has. On successive actions, however, the character must take an action to reload a single-shot firewand after every shot. If the character wants to draw a firedust weapon after combat has begun, the Charm enables her to draw and fire in a single action, without the DV penalty for readying a weapon.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Solar Exalted meditates and invokes a blessing on his weapon. When he finishes, flames of brilliant Essence writhe along the barrel of his firewand or similar weapon, covering it in intricate golden filigree. The player spends two motes of Essence for the character to invoke the blessing, and these motes are committed until the Exalt fires the weapon, releasing the charge (at which point, the filigree vanishes). Add the character's permanent Essence to the base damage of the prepared weapon when it is next fired.
   If the character uses this Charm against creatures of darkness (see the Charm Concept box on p. 192 of Exalted), the weapon deals aggravated damage. If the Exalt using this Charm also invokes Blossom of Inevitable Demise Technique, the bonus dice are added after the damage has been doubled. The dice increase gained with Blessing of Righteous Solar Spark Meditation cannot be doubled with any other Charm that doubles base damage.
   If the martial artist has multiple firewands, such as a matched pair of plasma tongue repeaters, this Charm works on only one at a time. Blessing a weapon in combat takes two actions (Speed 6 for each). Finally, if the Solar using a "blessed" firewand activates a Charm that allows him to make multiple attacks, the bonus damage must be divided evenly among her targets.</description>

        <description>Firewands are prized and powerful weapons, but most flame weapons fire only a single shot. For a Solar with this Charm, however, a firewand becomes a much more efficient and terrible weapon in battle.
   After the character attacks with her weapon, the player may spend one mote for the character and attempt a reflexive (Wits + Martial Arts) roll, difficulty 2. If the roll succeeds, the character's hands move in a blur, trailing faint clouds of black firedust in the air around her, as she reloads her weapon and brings it to bear before her next action. The Exalt still suffers the -1 DV penalty for reloading. If the roll fails, the character still suffers the penalty but does not load the weapon correctly. A botch means the trails of black firedust ignite around the martial artist's upper torso. An appropriate stunt can also allow another character to target and ignite the "ebon devils" surrounding a Righteous Devil. Either way, the igniting firedust inflicts the weapon's base damage to the character, but only if the martial artist fails or botches the reloading roll. If she loads her weapon properly, she does not leave enough firedust floating in the air for an enemy to do her harm.</description>

        <description>Creation itself seems to hold its breath when the martial artist cloaks himself in the majestic and terrible stillness of the Righteous Devil Form. He exerts an inescapable gravity and a withering unease that sends the innocent scurrying away and calls the unjust to reap the consequences of their deeds. When a Righteous Devil activates this Charm, all extras who lay eyes on him move swiftly for cover, pulling other innocent bystanders along with them and bolting doors or windows behind them.
   At the same time, the martial artist can compel chosen people to confront him. The compulsion has a radius equal to (the Righteous Devil's Essence x 10) yards and is an unnatural mental influence. Even spending Willpower points won't hold it at bay for long. The martial artist's target must spend one Willpower each action to resist the Righteous Devil's dreadful gravity. Otherwise, the target must walk out and confront the Righteous Devil face to face. The effect ends for the rest of the scene once a target makes eye contact and spends one subsequent action in combat or parley with the Exalt. The Righteous Devil can designate as many opponents as he has dots of Essence as "targets" for this Charm's purposes, but he must do so the moment he activates the Charm.</description>

He rarely spoke to anyone who was not a member of his circle or one of his students, preferring to let his flame weapons talk for him. Those fearsome weapons levied harsh judgment on the wicked for centuries, offering no explanations and no mercy. And for every depraved abomination the Solar's flames scoured from Creation, the Unconquered Sun granted him more power. Mortals and Exalted alike knew well enough of his deeds to respect and fear the Nameless Solar. To the wicked, he was the Pitiless Devil, who measured their lives on the unforgiving Azure Abacus. To the innocent, he was the Blind Exemplar, whose eyes could not see the just. To his few select students, he was the Righteous Master, who could not rest while evil dwelled within Creation. Only the members of his original circle ever knew his real name, and he destroyed them every one when they fell from the path of righteousness.
   The martial art this paragon developed vanished entirely from Creation at the time of the Usurpation. When the Nameless Solar realized what horrors most of his Solar compatriots had become, he gathered all of his students together at his obsidian temple manse, in Far Southern deserts since claimed by the Wyld. There, he passed judgment on the entirety of his fallen Solar ilk and expressed it by exterminating all of his students. When none remained, he destroyed himself in one last conflagration of firedust and burning Essence.
   Only in the most recent years have any of his students been reborn. Some of them remember the discipline required to wield their master's purifying flame. Some of them also remember the awful holocaust their master visited upon them. Was he righteous or mad? They cannot say.
   The few who remember the Nameless Solar's martial art teach it or practice it in solitude now, like the taciturn master they now remember only as the Righteous Devil. As for the soul and Exaltation of that master... both remain unaccounted for in both Creation and in the Underworld, and even the wisest in Yu-Shan do not know their fates.
   Weapons and Armor: The Charms of this style can be used only with firewands or other flame-discharge weapons. Armor does not hinder the practice of this style, though some Devils believe their righteousness is all the protection they need.
   Complementary Abilities: An Exalt must possess at least two dots of Archery before he can learn this martial art. Most practitioners keep their Archery rating at least as high as their Martial Arts (if only so they can Combo the style's Charms with powerful Archery Charms).</description>

        <description>The Righteous Devil extends her weapon's range with this Charm. A halo of gold and cobalt Essence rings the tip of the firewand's barrel, and six golden wings spiral out of the halo to speed the tongue of flame to its target. The player spends only one mote of Essence, and the normal range of the Exalt's firewand (or other flame weapon) doubles.</description>

        <description>The martial artist uses this Charm to perceive the ebb and flow of Essence permeating the world around him. When he does so, he could close his eyes and still attack, for he need not see his target to strike it. His weapon and his enemy are one. His caste mark flares, and several notched rings of silver-blue light spin around his target. These rings vary in width, numbering between three and nine and rotating around the target at odd angles.
    Both the martial artist and his target perceive this vision of silvery rings, known as the Azure Abacus. Its image remains in the Righteous Devil's mind's eye even if he closes his eyes. The display is also as visible to onlookers as is the Righteous Devil's anima banner (based on how much peripheral Essence the Exalt has spent up to that point). Modern Righteous Devils know the pattern of rings bears some arcane significance, but its meaning has been lost to time.
   When a martial artist who invokes this Charm fires his weapon, his shot zeroes in on his target, not as a stream of fire, but as a brilliant comet of fiery Essence. As the fireball closes in, the rings of the Abacus align themselves a moment before the martial artist's attack hits. As long as the target stays within the firing range of the martial artist's weapon, the attack cannot miss. Even if the target moves, the attack cannot be dodged by any means and can be parried only if the target has Charms that enable him to parry insubstantial attacks.
   In the eternal moment just before the Exalt's attack strikes the middle of the Abacus, time slows from the target's perspective. He hears a harmonious chorus of disembodied voices, gaining in volume as the azure rings align. These voices recount the target's wrongdoings and praise the Righteous Devil for taking this necessary action to resolve the soul's accounting. A subjected target suffers the effect of an unnatural persuasion at that point. His player must spend a point of Willpower for the character to do anything other than stare or scream as the chorus reaches its crescendo and the fiery bolt strikes. Should a target die as a result of this attack, his soul's accounting is resolved for this lifetime, and he proceeds immediately to his next incarnation, with no chance of becoming a ghost.

        <description>Once she achieves this Charm, the Exalt can use a firewand or similar weapon in either hand without the off-hand penalty. She may, for instance, use a one-handed flame weapon (such as a flame piece) in each hand simultaneously, though the player must use a flurry as normal for the character to attack with both weapons on the same action.</description>

        <description>When a martial artist who knows this Charm fires his weapon, the bolt of flame emerges from the barrel and explodes into a howling winged creature that spirals hungrily toward its target. The player rolls for the martial artist to hit his first target: If the roll succeeds, he may immediately attempt a second roll for the magma sprite to hit the same target again or leap to a new target. The Exalt may have the magma sprite make as many attacks in one action as he has dots of Essence, and each magma sprite inflicts the base damage of the martial artist's weapon.</description>

        <description>The low availability of firedust - especially outside the deserts of the Far South - along with the delicate upkeep the weapons require, make firewands costly to use very often. When invoking this Charm, though, the Righteous Devil enflames her inner reservoir of Essence like bellows stoking a furnace. With each breath, she channels Essence through her weapon, firing bolts of gossamer golden flame rather than needing firedust. As long as she has Essence to fuel her weapon, she need never again worry about running out of ammunition or spending miscellaneous actions to reload.</description>

        <description>A Righteous Devil master innately under-stands the divine energy that binds all of Creation together. When invoking this Charm, he attunes himself to the ambient matrix of Essence, focusing and filtering these energies through his righteous will. Essence trails radiate around his caste mark as Celestial fire and lightning writhe about his head and shoulders. When the Exalt shoots, a cobalt-and-gold, Essence-enriched deluge of flame engulfs his target. Any flammable items around the target (within the Exalt's Essence in yards) are burned to ash. The attack deals aggravated damage. Then, the target is engulfed in flames for a number of subsequent actions equal to the martial artist's Essence - but these flames inflict merely lethal damage. For each action the target remains on fire, he suffers lethal damage equal to the unmodified base Damage of the martial artist's weapon (minus his lethal soak).
   When the target suffers the aggravated damage, the target's player must then succeed on a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll, difficulty 3. If he does, the target suffers an internal penalty equal to the attacker's Essence to all dice pools. If he doesn't, the target can do nothing but writhe on the ground in agony until the flames go out. The victim's player must attempt this roll for every action his character remains aflame during which he wants to continue acting, and the difficulty increases by one on each subsequent action.</description>

            <name>Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style</name>
            <description>This weirdly musical martial art was invented late in the First Age by a Lunar Exalt with its eponymous songbird as her totem animal. The Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style expressed her belief in the power of voice and music. The style's training focused more on breath control, awe-inspiring war cries and fierce kiais than on chops and kicks. Meditation exercises included chanting single tones or syllables for long periods and eventually learning how to chant a chord using the natural overtones of the voice. Students also developed the keen perception needed to hear and understand the subtle resonance of Essence - not to mention sizing up their opponents. The best of the style's practitioners could spin their shouts into lyrics and their music into a force controlling mind and matter alike.
   The original Silver-Voiced Nightingale believed that both harmony and dissonance were needed to describe Creation and produce the most beautiful music. As a result, this style possesses two Charm sequences, each with its own Form-type Charm. The sequences intersect in two special Charms, and mastery of the style requires learning both the harmonious and dissonant forms. Focusing on one sequence over the other produces a spiritual imbalance that can become dangerous.
    Even before the Usurpation, the Silver-Voiced Nightin-gale Style languished in obscurity. The first Nightingale was never sociable and left no written records behind her. She'd had few students. As a result, the already rare style became even rarer after her death, and most scholars of the martial arts thought it lost by the end of the Shogunate.Some of the returning Solar Exalted, however, have clear enough memories to relearn it on their own, and one or two Lunars and Sidereals remain alive who picked it up long ago. Therefore, the voice of the Nightingale sings once more in the twilight of an Age.
   Weapons and Armor: The Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style is not normally compatible with any weapons. The nightingale, after all, is not a naturally warlike creature. The Weapon-Tuning Resonance Charm, however, allows characters to harmonize with certain weapons, and practitioners of this style treat attacks using harmonic weapons as "unarmed".
   Complementary Abilities: A character needs at least two dots of Performance before she can learn this style. Normally, a Silver-Voiced Nightingale weaves her Charms into song. A character with a harmonized weapon can also manifest the Charms through this special instrument. Creative, advanced students (with Performance 4 or greater) can adapt their kiais for any sound - clapping, whistling, banging on debris - at a -2 internal penalty on the roll for each Charm. In short, this style doesn't always look or sound even remotely the same when different people use it. If the martial artist is totally silenced in every way, though - if a sorcerer, for example, hushes the whole area with a spell - then the style's Charms cannot be used.
   Wearing armor forbids the use of Silver-Voiced Nightin-gale Style, unless the martial artist has used Weapon-Tuning Resonance to make his armor a musical instrument.</description>

        <description>The martial artist's voice rises in a song of triumph, and in response, her allies take heart and fight more fiercely. For each action in which the Silver-Voiced Nightingale spends two motes, she and all allies within (Essence x 5) yards receive a one-die bonus to attacks and +1 MDV. Rolls to coordinate attacks take a +2 bonus. If the martial artist is part of a mass combat unit of Magnitude 1 or 2, her battle-hymn confers a +1 bonus to Attack and Morale ratings for the unit's action. The martial artist can perform any sort of combat action while using this Charm, as long as it doesn't use any Ability except Martial Arts.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Charm Terrifying Battle Shriek, then she suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice she receives for channeling Willpower through her Valor and Conviction. This penalty stacks with other Virtue penalties imposed by Charms of this style and is in effect regardless of whether the character is actually using the Charm.</description>

            <description>This weirdly musical martial art was invented late in the First Age by a Lunar Exalt with its eponymous songbird as her totem animal. The Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style expressed her belief in the power of voice and music. The style's training focused more on breath control, awe-inspiring war cries and fierce kiais than on chops and kicks. Meditation exercises included chanting single tones or syllables for long periods and eventually learning how to chant a chord using the natural overtones of the voice. Students also developed the keen perception needed to hear and understand the subtle resonance of Essence - not to mention sizing up their opponents. The best of the style's practitioners could spin their shouts into lyrics and their music into a force controlling mind and matter alike.
   The original Silver-Voiced Nightingale believed that both harmony and dissonance were needed to describe Creation and produce the most beautiful music. As a result, this style possesses two Charm sequences, each with its own Form-type Charm. The sequences intersect in two special Charms, and mastery of the style requires learning both the harmonious and dissonant forms. Focusing on one sequence over the other produces a spiritual imbalance that can become dangerous.
    Even before the Usurpation, the Silver-Voiced Nightin-gale Style languished in obscurity. The first Nightingale was never sociable and left no written records behind her. She'd had few students. As a result, the already rare style became even rarer after her death, and most scholars of the martial arts thought it lost by the end of the Shogunate.Some of the returning Solar Exalted, however, have clear enough memories to relearn it on their own, and one or two Lunars and Sidereals remain alive who picked it up long ago. Therefore, the voice of the Nightingale sings once more in the twilight of an Age.

        <description>The martial artist's voice rises in a howl that promises horrible death to her foes. For every action in which the Silver-Voiced Nightingale spends two motes, her player rolls (Perception + Martial Arts) and compares the result to the Dodge MDV of every foe within (Essence x 5) yards. Each foe whose MDV does not surpass the roll's successes incurs a -1 internal penalty on all actions he initiates during the martial artist's action, and he adds one tick to the Speed of his action from the fear-induced hesitation. In mass combat, this Charm can impose a -1 internal penalty and -1 Morale on an opposing unit of up to Magnitude 2. The martial artist can perform any sort of combat action while using this Charm, as long as that action doesn't use any Ability except Martial Arts.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Charm Inspiring Battle Hymn, then he suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice he receives for channeling Willpower through his Compassion and Temperance.

        <description>When a Silver-Voiced Nightingale uses this Charm, she moves in perfect counterpoint to her opponent. A brief kata and several sharp notes allow her to sound him out, using a (Perception + Martial Arts) roll with a difficulty equal to his Essence. For every success on this roll (to a limit equal to her own Essence score), the martial artist may reduce his Dodge or Parry DV against her attacks by one and add one to her own Dodge or Parry DV against him. The DV adjustments last as long as the martial artist continues to fight this opponent and no one else.
   The martial artist also hears snatches of sounds that matter to her foe: his lover's name, perhaps; for an introspective literary man, his favorite poem; or, for a loyal general, a snatch of his country's national anthem. From these clues, the martial artist can determine one of her enemy's Intimacies per scene, if she can keep the Charm's effect running for five actions.</description>

        <description>The Nightingale sings a cascade of notes to arouse an emotion of his choice while focusing his will and Essence on his target, who must be within (Essence x 10) yards. The martial artist's player rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts). If the result exceeds the target's Dodge MDV, the target feels whatever emotion the Silver-Voiced Nightingale wishes her to feel about anything or anyone he chooses that is present at the time. Thereafter, the emotion returns every time the target sees that thing again. (Intimacies, Virtues and Motiva-tions may reduce the target's Dodge MDV for this purpose, as detailed on p. 172 of Exalted).
   Spending a Willpower point enables the target to fight past this unnatural mental influence for a scene. If the target does so three times, she breaks the Charm's influence.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Charm Voice of the Night Bird, then he suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice he receives for channeling Willpower through his Valor and Conviction.

        <description>The martial artist draws a deep breath as he takes the stance for an attack, then shouts a violent kiai. The force of his call strikes the enemy like a punch. By spending three motes, the Nightingale can make any Martial Arts attack sonic. He can launch it against anyone within (Martial Arts x 10) yards, and his player uses (Perception + Martial Arts) for its attack roll. Charisma replaces Strength for its base damage. The battle cry's damage is normally bashing, but it can be increased or made lethal with a weapon or appropriate Charm (such as Weeping Nightingale Form). The Nightin-gale could even attempt to shout a weapon from an enemy's hand or knock her off her feet. Doing the former acts as a ranged attempt to disarm a target (per the rules on p. 158 of Exalted), incurring the standard -4 penalty. Doing the latter follows the knockdown rules on p. 153 of Exalted. (If the Charm-supplemented attack attempts to deliberately cause knockdown, its Accuracy suffers the standard -2 penalty, as well as a -4 penalty since the attack is ranged). Voice of the Night Bird cannot be parried without a stunt or a Charm, though it can be dodged.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Charm Haunting Heart-Rending Melody, then he suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice he receives for channeling Willpower through his Compassion and Temperance. This penalty stacks with other Virtue penalties imposed by Charms of this style and is in effect regardless of whether the character is actually using the Charm.</description>

        <description>This Charm enables a Silver-Voiced Nightingale to form an enduring mystic link to one of the people to whom he has formed an Intimacy. The martial artist and his Intimacy must be together and agree to the link. Forming the link costs one Willpower and three experience points from both persons, and five motes from the Exalt.
   Henceforth, the martial artist can check on the other person's condition and activities by singing and spending one mote. This action is a reflexive one. The player rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts). Gaining a general sense of the other person's physical and emotional state is difficulty 1. Receiving knowledge of the character's current activities is difficulty 2. Gaining a clear vision of the other character, as if the martial artist were standing next to her, is difficulty 4. (Gaining a higher-difficulty connection grants the lower-difficulty information automatically). Should the martial artist's player's roll gain four or more successes, the martial artist and the object of his Intimacy can converse, as long as they do so by singing. At any level of contact, however, the Intimacy can open the link both ways to gain an equal sense of the martial artist's condition. If the Intimacy also can channel Essence, she can initiate the link (and her player makes the roll to find the depth of contact). Maintaining the link costs one mote per action, and either character can pay the cost.
   Furthermore, when the characters have a two-way link, either one can send Willpower to the other. A character can transfer only one Willpower point per action, and neither party can possess more Willpower points than his normal maximum.
   If either character ceases to treat the other as an Intimacy, the link between them breaks forever. The experience points committed to it are lost. The Charm is stackable in that the character can form mystic links to more than one Intimacy.</description>

            <description>This weirdly musical martial art was invented late in the First Age by a Lunar Exalt with its eponymous songbird as her totem animal. The Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style expressed her belief in the power of voice and music. The style's training focused more on breath control, awe-inspiring war cries and fierce kiais than on chops and kicks. Meditation exercises included chanting single tones or syllables for long periods and eventually learning how to chant a chord using the natural overtones of the voice. Students also developed the keen perception needed to hear and understand the subtle resonance of Essence - not to mention sizing up their opponents. The best of the style's practitioners could spin their shouts into lyrics and their music into a force controlling mind and matter alike.
   The original Silver-Voiced Nightingale believed that both harmony and dissonance were needed to describe Creation and produce the most beautiful music. As a result, this style possesses two Charm sequences, each with its own Form-type Charm. The sequences intersect in two special Charms, and mastery of the style requires learning both the harmonious and dissonant forms. Focusing on one sequence over the other produces a spiritual imbalance that can become dangerous.
    Even before the Usurpation, the Silver-Voiced Nightin-gale Style languished in obscurity. The first Nightingale was never sociable and left no written records behind her. She'd had few students. As a result, the already rare style became even rarer after her death, and most scholars of the martial arts thought it lost by the end of the Shogunate.Some of the returning Solar Exalted, however, have clear enough memories to relearn it on their own, and one or two Lunars and Sidereals remain alive who picked it up long ago. Therefore, the voice of the Nightingale sings once more in the twilight of an Age.
   Weapons and Armor: The Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style is not normally compatible with any weapons. The nightingale, after all, is not a naturally warlike creature. The Weapon-Tuning Resonance Charm, however, allows characters to harmonize with certain weapons, and practitioners of this style treat attacks using harmonic weapons as "unarmed".
   Complementary Abilities: A character needs at least two dots of Performance before she can learn this style. Normally, a Silver-Voiced Nightingale weaves her Charms into song. A character with a harmonized weapon can also manifest the Charms through this special instrument. Creative, advanced students (with Performance 4 or greater) can adapt their kiais for any sound - clapping, whistling, banging on debris - at a -2 internal penalty on the roll for each Charm. In short, this style doesn't always look or sound even remotely the same when different people use it. If the martial artist is totally silenced in every way, though - if a sorcerer, for example, hushes the whole area with a spell - then the style's Charms cannot be used.
   Wearing armor forbids the use of Silver-Voiced Nightin-gale Style, unless the martial artist has used Weapon-Tuning Resonance to make his armor a musical instrument.</description>

        <description>Standing straight and pitching her voice to reach all of her listeners, the Nightingale's song rings out with exquisite clarity. So moved are her opponents by its beauty that, as long as they can hear her and are within (her Essence x 10) yards of her, their attacks against her suffer an internal penalty equal to (her Martial Arts - foe's Temperance). Moreover, if a foe acts on a tick during which the martial artist is guarding, he finds the loveliness of the Nightingale's song so disarming that he cannot attack her without spending a Willpower point.
   These are active effects. They persist as long as the character sings. A character can stop singing, however, without deactivating the form. Should she start singing again before the scene ends, the effects come back into play without requiring the character to spend more Essence.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Weeping Nightingale Form, she suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice she receives for channeling Willpower through her Valor and Conviction. This penalty stacks with other Virtue penalties imposed by Charms of this style and is in effect regardless of whether the character is actually using the Charm. Characters who know both forms cannot use both at the same time.</description>

        <description>When a Nightingale sobs, those who hear it cannot help but be affected by the bitterness of her tears. The discordance of the Weeping Nightingale's song is so bleak and brutal that her listeners want to clap their hands over their ears. Even if they don't, they are so dismayed and distracted by it that, as long as they are within (her Essence x 10) yards of her, they take an external penalty equal to her Essence on all Perception rolls.
   Furthermore, the martial artist's piercing tone vibrates horribly within the very bones of everyone within (her Essence x 10) yards of her. The character inflicts lethal damage with any Martial Arts attacks, including sonic ones. Particularly resonant objects in the area might break even if the character doesn't attack them.
   These are active effects. They persist as long as the character sings. A character can stop singing, however, without deactivating the form. Should she start singing again before the scene ends, the effects come back into play without requiring the character to spend more Essence.
   The martial artist also becomes impossible to attack from surprise. Any intent to do harm, to her or anyone else within (Essence x 10) yards of her, sounds as a dissonance in the music that plays in the character's head. This Charm provides a perfect defense against an attack's being unexpected, though not against the attack itself. A character using this form can allow an unexpected attack against someone else to remain unexpected if she does not warn the attack's intended victim.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Dulcet Nightingale Form, she suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice she receives for channeling Willpower through her Compassion and Temperance. This penalty stacks with other Virtue penalties imposed by Charms of this style and is in effect regardless of whether the character is actually using the Charm. Characters who know both forms cannot use both at the same time.</description>

        <description>A Silver-Voiced Nightingale's natural weapon is sound itself. But if song can be forged into a weapon, so can weapons produce sounds. This Charm allows the martial artist to bring a weapon into the chorus of her battle, making it compatible with Martial Arts attacks and Charms of this style.
   For a wielder to "tune" a weapon using this Charm, it must be built or modified to have a harmonic quality. A character who knows this Charm knows the principles of musical weaponry. Actually building the weapon requires three dots in Craft (Air) and two dots in a Craft related to the weapon in question. Two characters - a smith and a poet-warrior, for example - can work together to create a musical weapon.
   It's difficult for such weapons to be naturally useful in battle. A silver blade beaten together from filigree-fine chimes, for example, is more decorative than deadly, even in the hands of a master swordsman. Unless it is tuned, harmonic weaponry takes at least a -1 penalty to Accuracy because it isn't optimized for combat. Some forms of armor can be tuned as well, such as a breastplate shaped to ring like steel drums, for instance. Harmonic armor has its lethal and bashing soak reduced by one point each.
   Once a Nightingale spends a six-tick action committing four motes to her weapon, the above weaknesses disappear, and the weapon gains a +1 bonus to each of its traits. If the weapon in question is a bow, its range increases by 50 yards. (Any other ranged weapon gains 10 yards). Harmonic armor gains one point of lethal and bashing soak above normal.
   Although bell-toned swords and magical singing staves would seem to be the most obvious choices, some Nightingales have made others. A minor goddess of archery keeps the bow of one long-dead practitioner on display in Yu-Shan, its hollow, flute-toned arrows arrayed tastefully before it. The only limitation on what may be made into a harmonic weapon is that it must actually be a weapon. Violins or wind chimes, no matter how sharp, cannot be used with this Charm.</description>

        <description>Beginning softly in a minor key, the Nightingale's voice calms every listener whose Dodge MDV is lower than his (Charisma + Martial Arts). Soldiers drop their weapons, and vicious beasts sink to their haunches and bow their heads. Everyone can still act, but they have no desire to attack anyone, or even to speak cruelly. Most will placidly go about their business, speaking little so they can hear the music better.
   Characters lulled by the serene aria can spend a Willpower point to take any offensive action, but they cannot wholly shake off its effects. Such actions suffer an internal penalty of the affected character's own (Compassion + Temperance). Someone who is entirely fixed on violence can eventually break through the effect, though. If, in one scene, a character spends more Willpower points to take offensive action than the Nightingale's Martial Arts score, then she becomes immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene.
   If a character with this Charm has not learned the Charm Resounding Songbird's Cry, she suffers a -1 penalty to the number of bonus dice she receives for channeling Willpower through her Valor and Conviction. This penalty stacks with other Virtue penalties imposed by Charms of this style and is in effect regardless of whether the character is actually using the Charm.</description>

        <description>Throwing his head back and closing his eyes, the Silver-Voiced Nightingale shrieks an awful cry. Glass and crystal shatters spectacularly, as metal warps and blood pours from people's ears. The martial artist makes one attack using his (Perception + Martial Arts), with a base bashing damage of his Charisma. The attack strikes everyone within (Martial Arts x 10) yards, except the martial artist himself, and it cannot be dodged or parried without a stunt or a Charm. The attack cannot be aimed. The Nightingale cannot choose to spare anyone but himself. Bonuses from a Nightingale's harmonic weapon may apply to this attack (though the damage remains bashing unless it is augmented by a relevant Charm), as can any damage bonuses from Weeping Nightingale Form, should the character be using it.

As a result, the already rare style became even rarer after her death, and most scholars of the martial arts thought it lost by the end of the Shogunate.Some of the returning Solar Exalted, however, have clear enough memories to relearn it on their own, and one or two Lunars and Sidereals remain alive who picked it up long ago. Therefore, the voice of the Nightingale sings once more in the twilight of an Age.
   Weapons and Armor: The Silver-Voiced Nightingale Style is not normally compatible with any weapons. The nightingale, after all, is not a naturally warlike creature. The Weapon-Tuning Resonance Charm, however, allows characters to harmonize with certain weapons, and practitioners of this style treat attacks using harmonic weapons as "unarmed".
   Complementary Abilities: A character needs at least two dots of Performance before she can learn this style. Normally, a Silver-Voiced Nightingale weaves her Charms into song. A character with a harmonized weapon can also manifest the Charms through this special instrument. Creative, advanced students (with Performance 4 or greater) can adapt their kiais for any sound - clapping, whistling, banging on debris - at a -2 internal penalty on the roll for each Charm. In short, this style doesn't always look or sound even remotely the same when different people use it. If the martial artist is totally silenced in every way, though - if a sorcerer, for example, hushes the whole area with a spell - then the style's Charms cannot be used.
   Wearing armor forbids the use of Silver-Voiced Nightin-gale Style, unless the martial artist has used Weapon-Tuning Resonance to make his armor a musical instrument.</description>

        <description>At the end of the world, there will be no sound at all. With a slicing gesture, sealing her lips closed, the Silver-Voiced Nightingale cuts off all the sounds around her, drawing forth a small part of the terrible silence to come.
   For everyone within (Martial Arts x 10) yards of the martial artist, the world becomes utterly silent. They feel isolated, surrounded by strangers and unable to comprehend the despair that has descended upon them. Some sink to their knees; some cry helplessly. They remain inactive until the end of the scene.
   A threat of imminent lethal damage can break the will-less despondency, as can touching an affected person and saying his name, but even these measures cannot enable the freed person to hear anything until he leaves the area around the martial artist. Spending more Willpower points than the Nightingale's Martial Arts score also lets a character defeat the emotional effect. Note, however, that characters normally spend just one Willpower point per action, and the character cannot take other actions until he spends all the necessary points. Characters with a higher Dodge MDV than the Nightingale's Martial Arts can act before then, but they still must spend a Willpower point for every action they take until they spend enough points to overcome the effect entirely.
   At the Storyteller's discretion, extras or un-Exalted mortal characters who suffer Impending Silence for its duration may be traumatized enough to suffer long-term mental effects such as catatonia or recurring nightmares.
   Although it feels totally silent, the area is not actually hushed. People simply cannot perceive sound. Therefore, the Silver-Voiced Nightingale may use all Charms of this style with impunity. Other practitioners of the style may use Charms from this style as well, as long as they have freed themselves from the emotional effects of this Charm.</description>

While using the Tiger Form, add the character's Martial Arts score to her raw damage when making Martial Arts attacks barehanded or while wearing tiger claws. The martial artist also adds her permanent Essence to her bashing and lethal soak totals. The character's Martial Arts attacks automatically inflict lethal damage in the form of bloody lacerations even if she isn't wearing tiger claws, and the character suffers no penalties for fighting while prone.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances a Tiger martial artist's ability to sneak up on his opponent. For every two motes of Essence spent activating the Charm, the character's player may add one die to all Stealth and Awareness rolls involved in the ambush. The effects remain until the character ambushes his target (or the target detects him). The character cannot spend more motes to increase his dice pool than he has points of permanent Essence. This Charm works only when a character actually sneaks up on an opponent. The character gains no bonuses if he tries to sneak away from danger like a mouse. The Charm also does not enhance Stealth for any other purpose (such as sneaking up to pick someone's pocket or evading a patrol of Black Helms).</description>

When the martial artist attacks a target who is not aware of her presence, the character ignores half of the target's lethal or bashing soak. The target's surprise must be total, however.

        <description>As the snarling roar of an ethereal tiger echoes in the air, the character lashes out in a frenzy of deadly blows. A character using this Charm makes two Martial Arts attacks every action (with no multiple-action penalty). In addition, the character may immediately attempt a Martial Arts counterattack whenever she is successfully attacked. The martial artist's player adds the extra successes from the attacker's roll as bonus dice of raw damage to the character's own counterattack. This Charm cannot be used to retaliate against any other counterattack Charm. The character's attacks and counterattacks inflicts lethal damage even if the martial artist does not wear tiger claws. A character who uses Angry Predator Style cannot use any other extra action Charms while this Charm remains active.</description>

            <name>Cobra Style</name>
            <description>Cobra style emerged in the latter years of the Shogunate, during a time of internecine strife that was tearing apart the last vestiges of Solar infrastructure. Out of this period of waste and war came a ruthless killer wielding a vicious fusion of Snake and Crane.
       Known as Cobra Samue due to the snakeskin jacket he wore, the killer wielded a style never before seen in Creation. As Cobra style's sole practitioner, Cobra Samue was responsible for the deaths of a dozen Dragon-Blooded officials. His victims were left horribly twisted by his poisonous attacks, his Heavenly Brand of Penance burned into their backs by an unknown and horrific final attack.
   Initially the killings were seen as the work of a non-partisan mercenary. It was only when four Sidereals were subsequently murdered, their corpses branded by the immolating poison of the Cobra, that the Fivescore Fellowship recognized that one amongst them had gone mad.
   They were correct. The man called Cobra Samue was also known as Ni Zhang, a legendary Bronze Faction martial arts master.
   During the Usurpation he was forced to kill a century-old Lawgiver whom he had trained since the man's Second Breath. Zhang knew the Solar was not a crazed monster, and the killing of a favored student weighed upon his soul. When he saw the same excesses and waste mirrored in the Shogunate, it was more than he could bear. He saw himself as having been duped into betrayal and murder so that new tyrants could assume the reins of power. Creation was no safer. All that had changed was that he was now a killer - a murderer. Ni Zhang had slain before, but he had always known the rightness of his cause. When he blended Snake and Crane into the first steps of the Cobra he was no longer sure. The possibility that he had been deceived drove him mad.
   A master of several Sidereal Martial Arts, Ni Zhang knew he needed only a Celestial level of power to make his displeasure known. The style need only be fast, cruel and unexpected. Transcendent unity with the stars was not required to commit acts of fatal betrayal. Rather, he would use poison.
   Under the southern sun he labored to emulate the greatest of all snakes, who was the desert king of death, the cold and merciless icon of serpentine majesty. Blending the speed and penetrating strikes of the Snake, and the fluttering, airy ripostes and defenses of the Crane, Ni Zhang fashioned Cobra as an ultimately lethal vector for delivering fatal poisonous counterattacks.
   Then the murders began.
   For a time it seemed the killer was unstoppable, his Cobra style invincible. The assassin called Cobra Samue haunted the minds of the Sidereal Exalted, who fell into greater distrust of one another, knowing that one amongst them must be the killer. While they fell over themselves investigating one another, at least one amongst them spent her time examining the bodies of the victims, and the scenes of those fatal battles, trying to construct a technique which might counter the unknown master's deadly style.
   When Anys Syn did finally confront the killer, she knew the secret which would fell the Cobra and end his bloody quest. Cobra style was born from the coldness of a heart which had betrayed and turned poisonous. It depended on that cold, inhuman state to make its user into a harbinger of death. So any semblance of a heart would be the traitor's undoing. She had also learned the true identity of Cobra Samue?the snakeskin coat he wore had belonged to a Solar she had trained alongside, under the watchful gaze of Master Ni Zhang.
   The battle was brutal, and Anys Syn would surely have died had she not uncovered the secret of Cobra Samue. Ni Zhang's feelings for his student created a fatal weakness in the cold and merciless power of his technique. In a sudden flash, Anys Syn held the beating heart of her master in one jet-wreathed claw as it crumbled to ash.
   How Cobra style survived into practice is another matter entirely. Some say Syn herself reconstructed the style from her single battle with Ni Zhang. Others say he left scrolls describing the techniques in the tomb of a Lawgiver, and those were carried away by bandits sometime after the fall of the Shogunate. Whatever the case may be, Cobra style exists as a notorious killing art, with an equally fearsome legacy.
   Weapons and Armor: Cobra style considers any identical set of dual wielded swords which do not possess the 2 tag to be unarmed attacks for the purpose of its Charms. It may not be practiced in armor.
   Notes: Cobra stylists wield their blades with a descending grip?the blades facing the ground with the hilts facing the sky. This facilitates punching without ever releasing the blade, and allows the practitioner to adjust his swing for a fatal strike. Students of Cobra also carry a compliment of ranged ammunition and throwing weaponry. This style provides no inherent ranged attacks, but allows the practitioner to unleash counterattacks against opponents at range through the style's Form and the Charm Death Dreaming Flux.</description>

        <description>The Cobra stylist forms his hands into the famous fangs for which this style is known. Bending and poising his fingers into perfect receptacles for his killing Essence, his "hand fang" strike gains the following stats: Speed 5, Accuracy +3, Damage +5L, Defense +2, Rate 1, Tags: N. A character using this attack adds one automatic success to all Martial Arts attacks which seek to Poison the target. The Cobra's Fangs share Rate with the martial artist's punch attack; so, since a punch is Rate 3, the character could punch twice and fang strike once in a single flurry. The Cobra's Fangs are considered an unarmed attack for the purpose of Cobra style Charms, or for any Martial Arts Charm with the Poison Keyword, but are not compatible with any other Charms of any other style.
   When the character has learned the Charm Marked by Eternity, his fangs are further enhanced: they now do 8L Damage, have a Defense of +3, and add two automatic successes to Poison-inflicting Martial Arts attacks.</description>

        <description>The cobra's eye flashes as he marks his targets, instilling them with paralyzing fear. The martial artist imbues opponents with this terror and himself with the cobra's impossible grace. This Charm inflicts an external penalty equal to the Martial Artist's (Presence / 2, round up) on all attacks against him, as an Emotion effect which may not be resisted with Willpower. If an incoming attack is undodgeable, this Charm removes that quality.</description>

        <description>Pity those who would tread upon the cobra - it is the last step they will take. This Charm permits the martial artist to make an unarmed Martial Arts counterattack at his full dice pool in response to an attack directed at him. This counterattack adds three automatic successes if the attacker rolled fewer Join Battle successes at the beginning of the fight than the martial artist did. If he strikes his attacker, the martial artist inflicts a poison with the following traits: (10L/action, 2, -/-, -2 recurring). The recurring tag indicates that at each interval, the penalty increases by -1 unless the target has taken no Move, Dash or Jump actions since the last interval.
   At Essence 3+, if the user has Cobra Form active, he may pay an additional mote per target to launch this counterattack simultaneously against (Martial Arts) targets within 20 yards - he may even target individuals who have not attacked him. The Martial Artist pays for the attack only once and makes one roll, applying it to all tagets. This is called the Spitting Venom Attack.</description>

        <description>The martial artist rises up, body coiled to move, hands steady. While in Cobra Form, the martial artist's Cobra Fang attacks gain Rate 2. He may fight while prone without suffering any penalties, and may reflexively regain his feet at will without being considered to have taken a rise from prone action. Any Poison-keyword Martial Arts Charms the character uses are reduced in price by one mote, to a minimum of one mote, and their Toxicity increases by 2.
   Finally, any unexpected attacks the martial artist makes ignore soak altogether.
   The first time a Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability is used during the same action Cobra Form is activated, it adds a two Willpower surcharge to its activation cost.
   Additionally, the Cobra stylist enjoys the following benefits, if applicable:
• The Cobra stylist may invoke Snake Strikes the Heel (see Exalted, p. 241), Feather-Stirred Arrow Deflection (see Glories of the Most High, p. 103), and Flexing the Emerald Claw (see Ink Monkeys, vol. 10) as innate powers, if he knows any of those Charms. If activated in this manner, those Charms reduce their activation cost by one mote.
• If the character has an Overdrive pool, he adds one mote to that pool on every damage interval for poisons he has inflicted on anyone in the scene, including himself. This mote benefit stacks by the number of poisons on a single target, as well as poisons across multiple targets, but may not exceed five motes per action. Poisoned targets must be within 20 yards of the Martial Artist for him to benefit from this effect.</description>
        <comment>Dynamic Form Transition: One of Master Zhang's innovations to the field of martial arts, a practitioner of Cobra style who has learned Cobra Form may reflexively transition into that Form without a Charm activation in the following ways:

        <comment>On Cobra Form: "It's been in my head for a long time to demonstrate the trope of the multi-style martial arts master, who blends his techniques together for more powerful and dangerous styles. While Exalted has Combos, I never felt like it did a very good job of expressing a tangible thematic benefit to mastering multiple forms of combat, either in the setting material or the mechanics themselves. My personal mission statement with Cobra style was to do both.: -Ø</comment>
        <comment>On Cobra Form: "Nothing makes me happier than martial arts styles with built-in battle tactics and death spirals - so Cobra style makes me very happy. You may also notice that this style was designed with an eye toward inter-style synergy and providing benefits to practitioners of its sister styles. What Might Such Benefits Look Like, Applied To The Styles In Scroll Of The Monk? Hmm..." -H</comment>

            <description>Cobra style emerged in the latter years of the Shogunate, during a time of internecine strife that was tearing apart the last vestiges of Solar infrastructure. Out of this period of waste and war came a ruthless killer wielding a vicious fusion of Snake and Crane.
       Known as Cobra Samue due to the snakeskin jacket he wore, the killer wielded a style never before seen in Creation. As Cobra style's sole practitioner, Cobra Samue was responsible for the deaths of a dozen Dragon-Blooded officials. His victims were left horribly twisted by his poisonous attacks, his Heavenly Brand of Penance burned into their backs by an unknown and horrific final attack.
   Initially the killings were seen as the work of a non-partisan mercenary. It was only when four Sidereals were subsequently murdered, their corpses branded by the immolating poison of the Cobra, that the Fivescore Fellowship recognized that one amongst them had gone mad.
   They were correct. The man called Cobra Samue was also known as Ni Zhang, a legendary Bronze Faction martial arts master.
   During the Usurpation he was forced to kill a century-old Lawgiver whom he had trained since the man's Second Breath. Zhang knew the Solar was not a crazed monster, and the killing of a favored student weighed upon his soul. When he saw the same excesses and waste mirrored in the Shogunate, it was more than he could bear. He saw himself as having been duped into betrayal and murder so that new tyrants could assume the reins of power. Creation was no safer. All that had changed was that he was now a killer - a murderer. Ni Zhang had slain before, but he had always known the rightness of his cause. When he blended Snake and Crane into the first steps of the Cobra he was no longer sure. The possibility that he had been deceived drove him mad.
   A master of several Sidereal Martial Arts, Ni Zhang knew he needed only a Celestial level of power to make his displeasure known. The style need only be fast, cruel and unexpected. Transcendent unity with the stars was not required to commit acts of fatal betrayal. Rather, he would use poison.
   Under the southern sun he labored to emulate the greatest of all snakes, who was the desert king of death, the cold and merciless icon of serpentine majesty. Blending the speed and penetrating strikes of the Snake, and the fluttering, airy ripostes and defenses of the Crane, Ni Zhang fashioned Cobra as an ultimately lethal vector for delivering fatal poisonous counterattacks.
   Then the murders began.
   For a time it seemed the killer was unstoppable, his Cobra style invincible. The assassin called Cobra Samue haunted the minds of the Sidereal Exalted, who fell into greater distrust of one another, knowing that one amongst them must be the killer. While they fell over themselves investigating one another, at least one amongst them spent her time examining the bodies of the victims, and the scenes of those fatal battles, trying to construct a technique which might counter the unknown master's deadly style.
   When Anys Syn did finally confront the killer, she knew the secret which would fell the Cobra and end his bloody quest. Cobra style was born from the coldness of a heart which had betrayed and turned poisonous. It depended on that cold, inhuman state to make its user into a harbinger of death. So any semblance of a heart would be the traitor's undoing. She had also learned the true identity of Cobra Samue?the snakeskin coat he wore had belonged to a Solar she had trained alongside, under the watchful gaze of Master Ni Zhang.
   The battle was brutal, and Anys Syn would surely have died had she not uncovered the secret of Cobra Samue. Ni Zhang's feelings for his student created a fatal weakness in the cold and merciless power of his technique. In a sudden flash, Anys Syn held the beating heart of her master in one jet-wreathed claw as it crumbled to ash.
   How Cobra style survived into practice is another matter entirely. Some say Syn herself reconstructed the style from her single battle with Ni Zhang. Others say he left scrolls describing the techniques in the tomb of a Lawgiver, and those were carried away by bandits sometime after the fall of the Shogunate. Whatever the case may be, Cobra style exists as a notorious killing art, with an equally fearsome legacy.
   Weapons and Armor: Cobra style considers any identical set of dual wielded swords which do not possess the 2 tag to be unarmed attacks for the purpose of its Charms. It may not be practiced in armor.
   Notes: Cobra stylists wield their blades with a descending grip?the blades facing the ground with the hilts facing the sky. This facilitates punching without ever releasing the blade, and allows the practitioner to adjust his swing for a fatal strike. Students of Cobra also carry a compliment of ranged ammunition and throwing weaponry. This style provides no inherent ranged attacks, but allows the practitioner to unleash counterattacks against opponents at range through the style's Form and the Charm Death Dreaming Flux.</description>

        <description>The cobra unfurls its hood to show its victim death's true form. His stance radiates the authority over death he wields, permitting him to make a (Manipulation + Martial Arts) social attack against the Dodge MDV of one target within 20 yards, adding (Presence / 2, round up) automatic successes. The victim may add half their (Martial Arts or Presence, rounded down) to their MDV to resist this effect.
   If successful, the target is completely paralyzed, and may not move or act - they are Inactive as if held in a clinch. Even drawing breath is difficult - the victim begins to suffocate so long as they remain paralyzed (see Exalted, p. 130). The martial artist also may not move or attack while his victim is paralyzed (save for launching Counterattacks), as though he were controlling a clinch. Each time the martial artist's DV refreshes, his victim may attempt to free himself (this is treated as a standard Martial Arts attempt to breaking a clinch against a number of successes equal to the Cobra stylist's Presence + Essence). Otherwise, he remains paralyzed until the martial artist releases the motes committed to this Charm, or until he spends one Willpower to resist the Charm's unnatural mental influence. However, breaking Raising the Cobra's Hood by spending Willpower imposes a five-mote surcharge on the next Charm the victim activates on that tick. Characters become immune to Raising the Cobra's Hood for the rest of the scene after spending Willpower in this fashion three times.</description>

        <description>The snake attempts to cloak its lethal aspect behind the majesty of the crane, but can never truly hide its nature. The practitioner raises her arms and turns them out like the cantilevered wings of a water bird while folding her legs beneath her like the coils of a snake. She remains this way for one tick. During this time she may move along the ground by flapping her "wings" and twisting her waist sharply, spinning side to side, backwards or forwards as if she were standing. However, she may not take a Dash action, and her Dodge DV suffers a -3 penalty. Taking any sort of Jump action (including Charms such as Leaping Dodge Method) terminates this Charm automatically, but the uncoiling action doubles the length of the jump and adds (Essence) raw damage to any attack made during the jump.
   While assuming the False Crane Posture, each attack from a hostile opponent the practitioner successfully dodges without using a Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability at any point during attack resolution adds one dodge to a pool of up to (Martial Arts + 3) free reflexive perfect dodges. These dodges each last for one instant, are capable of dodging even undodgeable attacks the martial artist is aware of, cost 0 motes, do not count as a Charm activation and have an inverted Compassion Flaw; they cannot be used while the practitioner is aware of the presence of a character to whom she has an Intimacy with a positive emotional context.Furthermore, using any other Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability instantly consumes one of the practitioner's dodges, if he has any. If the martial artist has employed free reflexive dodges in the scene, and has none left, his next activation of a Charm with a Flaw of Invulnerability carries a one Willpower surcharge. If the practitioner manages to generate new free reflexive dodges, the surcharge is reinstated once these dodges are entirely depleted. The Cobra stylist retains any unused free reflexive dodges until the end of the scene.
   False Crane Posture does not count as a Charm activation while Cobra Form is active.</description>

        <description>The martial artist meditates for five ticks, at the end of which his Essence coils around him like a second skin, shimmering and scaled, accompanied by a serpentine hiss of anima. This creates (Essence) shimmers in the practitioner's anima, to a maximum of five. Each time the Cobra stylist fails to dodge an attack, the post-soak damage rolled against him is applied to one of his shimmers before it is applied to the martial artist. The attack appears to strike, and even feels as if it strikes the martial artist, but instead it tears away a castoff skin. Each shimmer has a number of -0 health levels equal to half the practitioner's Dodge DV (unmodified by Charms, spells or equipment), rounded up, with a minimum of 5. These health levels vanish when they suffer any damage at all, and the castoff skin is torn away and vanishes in a curl of steam. If an attack does more than the shimmer's health levels, the rest of the damage goes through to the martial artist. The practitioner must use his Dodge DV to qualify for this benefit; if he applies his Parry DV, attacks ignore the shimmers entirely. The Cobra stylist may not use Dread Scale Fascination again until all of his shimmers have been removed. Area-of-effect attacks apply their damage to all of the martial artist's shimmers simultaneously. If an attack destroys any shimmers without harming the martial artist, the martial artist is considered to have successfully dodged the attack only for the purpose of False Crane Posture.
   Finally, if the practitioner uses an instant-duration Charm bearing a Flaw of Invulnerability to prevent an attack from harming him, he loses one shimmer; if the Charm is tick length, he loses three, and if it is action length he loses five. This limitation does not apply to free reflexive dodges granted by False Crane Posture.</description>

        <description>The cobra slithers through a dream. Provoked by the presence of others, it condemns the living so that they might join it in a reverie of death. This Charm may only be used once per action; upon activation, the martial artist selects a single opponent who did not attack him during his previous action. The martial artist experiences an illusory affront on behalf of the selected opponent - an attack against himself which the practitioner imagines. This imaginary attack only occurs if the martial artist is inside the opponent's engagement range, and is made with whatever weapon the opponent currently wields (for example, if the opponent were wielding a bow, they would make an imaginary [Dexterity + Archery] attack). The attack is assumed to be automatically successful, but may be rolled to determine successes, damage and other elements of resolution if knowing this information is important for whatever Counterattack the martial artist plans to activate in response. If rolled, the illusory attack ignores the Cobra stylist's DVs and soak. As the attack is imaginary, no harm actually befalls the martial artist as a result of the strike; the attack is considered only real enough to permit the martial artist to trigger Counterattack Charms in response.
   If Cobra Form is active, Death-Dreaming Flux does not count as a Charm activation.</description>

            <name>Cobra Style</name>
            <description>Cobra style emerged in the latter years of the Shogunate, during a time of internecine strife that was tearing apart the last vestiges of Solar infrastructure. Out of this period of waste and war came a ruthless killer wielding a vicious fusion of Snake and Crane.
       Known as Cobra Samue due to the snakeskin jacket he wore, the killer wielded a style never before seen in Creation. As Cobra style's sole practitioner, Cobra Samue was responsible for the deaths of a dozen Dragon-Blooded officials. His victims were left horribly twisted by his poisonous attacks, his Heavenly Brand of Penance burned into their backs by an unknown and horrific final attack.
   Initially the killings were seen as the work of a non-partisan mercenary. It was only when four Sidereals were subsequently murdered, their corpses branded by the immolating poison of the Cobra, that the Fivescore Fellowship recognized that one amongst them had gone mad.
   They were correct. The man called Cobra Samue was also known as Ni Zhang, a legendary Bronze Faction martial arts master.
   During the Usurpation he was forced to kill a century-old Lawgiver whom he had trained since the man's Second Breath. Zhang knew the Solar was not a crazed monster, and the killing of a favored student weighed upon his soul. When he saw the same excesses and waste mirrored in the Shogunate, it was more than he could bear. He saw himself as having been duped into betrayal and murder so that new tyrants could assume the reins of power. Creation was no safer. All that had changed was that he was now a killer - a murderer. Ni Zhang had slain before, but he had always known the rightness of his cause. When he blended Snake and Crane into the first steps of the Cobra he was no longer sure. The possibility that he had been deceived drove him mad.
   A master of several Sidereal Martial Arts, Ni Zhang knew he needed only a Celestial level of power to make his displeasure known. The style need only be fast, cruel and unexpected. Transcendent unity with the stars was not required to commit acts of fatal betrayal. Rather, he would use poison.
   Under the southern sun he labored to emulate the greatest of all snakes, who was the desert king of death, the cold and merciless icon of serpentine majesty. Blending the speed and penetrating strikes of the Snake, and the fluttering, airy ripostes and defenses of the Crane, Ni Zhang fashioned Cobra as an ultimately lethal vector for delivering fatal poisonous counterattacks.
   Then the murders began.
   For a time it seemed the killer was unstoppable, his Cobra style invincible. The assassin called Cobra Samue haunted the minds of the Sidereal Exalted, who fell into greater distrust of one another, knowing that one amongst them must be the killer. While they fell over themselves investigating one another, at least one amongst them spent her time examining the bodies of the victims, and the scenes of those fatal battles, trying to construct a technique which might counter the unknown master's deadly style.
   When Anys Syn did finally confront the killer, she knew the secret which would fell the Cobra and end his bloody quest. Cobra style was born from the coldness of a heart which had betrayed and turned poisonous. It depended on that cold, inhuman state to make its user into a harbinger of death. So any semblance of a heart would be the traitor's undoing. She had also learned the true identity of Cobra Samue?the snakeskin coat he wore had belonged to a Solar she had trained alongside, under the watchful gaze of Master Ni Zhang.
   The battle was brutal, and Anys Syn would surely have died had she not uncovered the secret of Cobra Samue. Ni Zhang's feelings for his student created a fatal weakness in the cold and merciless power of his technique. In a sudden flash, Anys Syn held the beating heart of her master in one jet-wreathed claw as it crumbled to ash.
   How Cobra style survived into practice is another matter entirely. Some say Syn herself reconstructed the style from her single battle with Ni Zhang. Others say he left scrolls describing the techniques in the tomb of a Lawgiver, and those were carried away by bandits sometime after the fall of the Shogunate. Whatever the case may be, Cobra style exists as a notorious killing art, with an equally fearsome legacy.
   Weapons and Armor: Cobra style considers any identical set of dual wielded swords which do not possess the 2 tag to be unarmed attacks for the purpose of its Charms. It may not be practiced in armor.
   Notes: Cobra stylists wield their blades with a descending grip?the blades facing the ground with the hilts facing the sky. This facilitates punching without ever releasing the blade, and allows the practitioner to adjust his swing for a fatal strike. Students of Cobra also carry a compliment of ranged ammunition and throwing weaponry. This style provides no inherent ranged attacks, but allows the practitioner to unleash counterattacks against opponents at range through the style's Form and the Charm Death Dreaming Flux.</description>

        <description>The cobra reels in his victims with deadly magnetism. Upon activating this Charm, the martial artist makes a (Manipulation + Martial Arts + Essence) attack that is applied to the Dodge MDV of all opponents within 20 yards. Victims may add half their Martial Arts or Presence (rounded down) to their Dodge MDVs in order to resist. Those affected are compelled to immediately move as close as they are able to the martial artist and, having gotten as close as reasonably possible under the circumstances, attack him once. (For example, if the martial artist is in an open field, opponents will chase him until they are able to get to point blank range; if the martial artist is on the other side of a wide pit, opponents will approach the lip of the pit and then attack across it if able; if not, they will seek a path around). Resisting this unnatural mental influence costs one point of Willpower.
   Any character affected by this Charm whom the martial artist has poisoned resolve poison damage twice during each interval that passes until they are able to launch an attack at the martial artist, or until they spend Willpower. This does not hasten the poison's departure from the bodies of the afflicted; it merely increases its lethality. Spending Willpower to resist the Charm also causes any active poisons in the system to resolve one additional time on that tick; again, this does not reduce the amount of time it takes for the poison to leave the victim's system.</description>

        <description>His defense is a lie, thought Syn. My attacks humor him. - The Cobra hones his defense, transforming his fighting style in response to each of his enemy's attacks. Each time the practitioner is attacked while this Charm is active, he gains one style point which can be used to create a number of different enhancements to his fighting style. The martial artist must gain five style points (his "lead") before he can begin to transition into graduated combat effects. Additional style points accrued beyond the lead may be spent for combat benefits; point assignment is reflexive, costs no motes and does not count as a Charm activation. Style points are stocked indefinitely, but the martial artist may stock no more than (Martial Arts) points beyond the five point lead. Finally, he may not spend from the initial five style points unless an effect specifically allows him to do so. However, doing so renders him unable to spend additional style points, hampering his transitioning power until he has refilled his five point lead.
• The character may expend one lead point to ignore all penalties to one of his DVs against a single attack.
• The character reduces his wound penalties by the number of points expended for one action.
• The character retroactively increases his Join Battle result by one success for one point. This may assist King Cobra Strikes.
• The character gains two successes on his Join Battle roll per point expended. He may only pay this effect from his five point lead.
• The character adds one automatic success to his next use of King Cobra Strikes for each two points expended.
• The character spends two points to succeed on all poison resistance rolls for one action.
• If the character has an Overdrive pool, he may spend two points for one offensive mote.
• The character may stock one free reflexive attack for four points. Abyssal, Infernal, and Solar Exalted may stock up to (Dexterity + 3) free reflexive attacks, while Terrestrial and Celestial Exalts may stock up to their Dexterity. Other characters are limited to (Essence) free reflexive attacks. These attacks may only be invoked on the character's action tick, or on any tick on which the practitioner is attacked. However, attacking outside the character's action tick consumes two free reflexive attacks.
• The character's Move and Dash actions gain ten yards per tick for one action, for two points.
• The character adds the unexpected quality to a Counterattack Charm. This costs five lead points.</description>
        <comment>On Forked Tongue Transition: "The rules on free reflexive attacks require some attention, clarification, and adjustment. What you see here is an accurate representation of the rules as they will be expressed universally, in terms of both the Solar Charms I have already written, and any free reflexive attack Charms to be written in the future. As always, I reserve the right to make changes based on future observations and the needs of the game." -Ø</comment>

        <description>This strike is feared as one of the deadliest in martial arts. This Charm may be activated in step 10 during an unarmed Martial Arts attack that successfully inflicted damage on its target. If the target is already poisoned, the total Damage of all poisons in their system discharges at once - rather than moving through them at one die per interval, the total damage value of all poisons is combined and rolled at once. This damage becomes aggravated regardless of previous type, and has a Toxicity rating equal to that of the highest value among all poisons, plus 2.
   If the target survives Touch of Finality and had any poisons in his system, all poisons are burned out of his system, but he suffers a -4 internal penalty for two actions due to excruciating pain, and takes an automatic aggravated health level of damage in addition to any inflicted by the poisons.</description>

        <description>The spectacles on the back of the cobra represent the immortality of the Primordial who favored them. It is a mark which represents both infinity and the inevitability of death. A martial artist who learns this Charm gains a mark upon her back. It may be that of a cobra, or of a symbol which best reflects the character, such as a representation of her iconic anima. It must, however, display the danger she represents and her mastery of this Charm to all who see it.
   This Charm grants the martial artist the ability to safely store up to (Stamina) poisons within her body. These poisons lie dormant until she pays five motes to activate them. Doing so activates as many or as few poisons as the martial artist desires. Active poisons begin to affect the martial artist as normal, though she treats them as having a Toxicity (Essence rating) lower than normal.
   While the martial artist has poisons actively coursing through her body, she may inflict them on others with a successful unarmed Martial Arts attack which inflicts at least one level of damage by paying five motes. The martial artist may transfer as few or as many active poisons as she desires with a single attack. If she commits the motes, the target's back is marked by her brand, signifying that he is held in thrall by her mercy alone. Releasing the commitment causes the poisons to take their course as normal.
   The martial artist may store new poisons by successfully overcoming their Toxicity (mastery of this Charm permits her to add her Essence to the [Stamina + Resistance] roll to do so, and to replace Resistance with her Martial Arts rating if desired). This costs five motes. She may only divest herself of stored poisons by letting them run their course within her body, or by injecting them into targets with attacks.</description>

            <description>The training to become a Dragon of Air emphasizes flexibility, acrobatics and awareness of one's surroundings. The wind never stops when it hits an obstacle, instead turning aside and continuing on its path, and the Immaculates dedicated to the Air Dragon attempt to flow in the same way. They train hard in acrobatics, flips, leaps and balancing, all in an effort to mimic their exemplar's speed and twisting motion.
   Many Immaculates of the Air Dragon choose to fight without melee weapons, preferring to rely on their blindingly quick blows and the thrown weapons they can buoy and direct through their mastery over the wind. When they do use weapons in personal combat, they often prefer the fighting chain, using its length and flexibility to entangle and trip their opponents.
   The Air Dragon Style's signature weapon is the chakram. Chakrams come in a variety of shapes and visual styles. When each Immaculate Dragon of Air achieves his Form-type Charm for the style, he chooses his own pattern as his signature look.
   In combat, the Immaculate may hurl two chakrams as a single attack. He must have both chakrams on his person to do so, or be using an infinite jade chakram (see Exalted, p. 389). Both projectiles have a single attack roll and are treated by the target as a single attack, but if the attack hits, the target suffers damage for both. The Immaculate is able to make such an attack in concert with appropriate simple or supplemental Charms, but he must spend an additional mote to make the attack apply to both chakrams.

        <description>Even the smallest eddy of air carries volumes of information. An Immaculate of the Air Dragon can attune himself to the smallest variances in temperature and speed of the air around him, using the wind as his sight.
   When this Charm is active, the Immaculate can operate perfectly, blindfolded or in pitch darkness, as long as he is surrounded by air. He never suffers from unexpected attacks unless he is so beset with foes that he cannot avoid all the blows (when surrounded by multiple opponents). When used outside of combat, the Dragon-Blood may add a number of dice equal to his Essence to any Awareness roll as long as the focus of his attention is within a number of yards equal to his (Essence x 10).</description>

        <description>Such is the martial artist's command of the wind that he can drive it from his opponent's lungs. With a series of properly placed blows, the Immaculate strikes meridians that contract and immobilize the lungs, denying his opponent breath.
   If the attack is successful, it inflicts no damage. Instead, roll the Immaculate's (Strength + Martial Arts + Essence) against a difficulty of the target's Stamina. Each net success inflicts a cumulative -1 internal penalty on the target, and if penalties ever double the target's Stamina, the target is rendered unconscious.
   Creatures who do not need to breathe, such as automatons, the undead and spirits or targets using magic to obviate that need, are unaffected by this Charm.</description>

        <description>Air is invisible. In this, too, the Children of Mela emulate their element. By swathing herself with transparent air, the Immaculate can become nothing more than a ripple in her foes' view.
   Upon using this Charm, the Immaculate becomes virtually invisible for a number of actions equal to her Martial Arts rating. Those who try to attack her suffer a +2 external penalty on their attacks, and she adds two successes to any attempts to reestablish surprise. Because of the blur she leaves in the air as she passes, those nearby still know where she is unless she attempts to conceal herself using Stealth.
   The Storyteller may apply bonuses to those trying to find the Air Immaculate depending on when they last saw her. As a general guideline, someone who saw her disappear or who knows where she was on her last action adds three dice. Those who have no idea she's nearby add nothing. Each action in which an individual fails to locate or keep track of the Immaculate, he loses one bonus die (to a minimum of zero).</description>

        <description>The Immaculate becomes a whirlwind of death and destruction, spinning around an opponent faster than the eye can follow and unleashing a series of devastating attacks.
   This Charm is a magical flurry. For every three motes, the Immaculate makes an additional ranged or Martial Arts attack with his full dice pool, to a maximum number of attacks equal to his Martial Arts rating. The DV penalty for this flurry is equal to one-half the DV penalty for all attacks.</description>

            <description>The training to become a Dragon of Air emphasizes flexibility, acrobatics and awareness of one's surroundings. The wind never stops when it hits an obstacle, instead turning aside and continuing on its path, and the Immaculates dedicated to the Air Dragon attempt to flow in the same way. They train hard in acrobatics, flips, leaps and balancing, all in an effort to mimic their exemplar's speed and twisting motion.
   Many Immaculates of the Air Dragon choose to fight without melee weapons, preferring to rely on their blindingly quick blows and the thrown weapons they can buoy and direct through their mastery over the wind. When they do use weapons in personal combat, they often prefer the fighting chain, using its length and flexibility to entangle and trip their opponents.
   The Air Dragon Style's signature weapon is the chakram. Chakrams come in a variety of shapes and visual styles. When each Immaculate Dragon of Air achieves his Form-type Charm for the style, he chooses his own pattern as his signature look.
   In combat, the Immaculate may hurl two chakrams as a single attack. He must have both chakrams on his person to do so, or be using an infinite jade chakram (see Exalted, p. 389). Both projectiles have a single attack roll and are treated by the target as a single attack, but if the attack hits, the target suffers damage for both. The Immaculate is able to make such an attack in concert with appropriate simple or supplemental Charms, but he must spend an additional mote to make the attack apply to both chakrams.

        <description>With superb command over her element, the Immaculate channels impossibly strong gusts of air behind her attacks. Air Immaculates favor wearing down their foes with chakrams while using this Charm to prevent their foes from closing with them.
   For every point of raw damage the attack inflicts above the target's Stamina, the target suffers three yards of knockback. Targets may also have to check against knockdown, if the attack inflicts more damage than the target's (Stamina + Resistance) as normal.
   Some Immaculates use the wind to carry their attacks farther. Using this Charm with a thrown weapon increases the attack's range increment by an amount equal to the martial artist's Essence in addition to the Charm's normal effects.</description>

        <description>The Immaculate opens his mouth wide, loosing a fearsome shout that can shatter stone and eardrums alike. A gale-force blast leaves his mouth in a 90-degree arc, out to a distance of (Essence x 10) feet. His player makes a (Strength + Martial Arts) roll as an attack, which can only be dodged, not parried.
   Players of anyone affected by the Charm roll their characters' ([Dexterity or Stamina] + [Athletics or Resistance]) against a difficulty of the total successes on the martial artist's roll (before subtracting DV). If both her Strength and Athletics are less than the monk's net successes, a victim suffers knockdown and her player must roll her (Wits  + Resistance) at difficulty 1 to avoid immediately becoming inactive for a single action. Victims of this Charm who suffer both effects are also deafened for a number of actions equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts. Deafened targets lose two dice from all actions.
   By spending a point of Willpower, the Immaculate can focus the shout on a single target. The target cannot avoid the attack without a perfect defense, and the shout inflicts a number of health levels of lethal damage equal to the Immaculate's (Strength + Essence), which bypasses armor. In addition, add any levels of damage inflicted to the difficulty to avoid knockdown.</description>

        <description>Air Immaculates are light on their feet, and the very wind itself carries them when they ask. Activating this Charm, the martial artist detects the smallest updrafts (or creates them) and uses them to buoy her steps.
   This Charm doubles the Immaculate's movement rate and leaping distance for the duration, and the most flimsy surfaces can support her. She can run along a lake's surface, skip from leaf to leaf without falling and dash up smoke trails - as long as she keeps moving. If she does not move in each tick, she falls. She may continue to run along impossible surfaces as long as she re-invokes the Charm as soon as it ends.</description>

        <description>The Elemental Dragon of Air rules over the storms of Creation. Immaculate monks who emulate that Dragon learn to imitate some measure of that command. Spreading his arms wide for a moment to focus his elemental Essence and his breathing, the monk brings his hands together in a thunderous clap, which can deafen and stun those who hear it.
   The thunderclap affects anyone within (Essence x 10) yards of the Immaculate (no attack roll required). The players of all such characters must make a Reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll. If one gets successes equal to or greater than the Immaculate's Essence, the target immediately becomes inactive until his next action as the sound waves vibrate through her. Yet she suffers no further penalty. Otherwise, the violent sound also inflicts (Strength + Martial Arts) bashing damage that ignores armor. Targets also become deaf for a number of actions equal to the Immaculate's Essence, losing two dice from all dice pools due to disorientation.
   Spirits are even more susceptible to the effects of this Charm. Double the Immaculate's Essence for all purposes when applying this Charm's effects to a god, demon or elemental. Air Immaculates do not need to be able to see or otherwise affect spirits in order for this Charm to harm them.
   The Immaculate is immune to her own thunderclap, and he can render select persons immune to the Charm's effects at a cost of one mote per person. She cannot single out spirits for immunity to this Charm. If a spirit is in range, it is susceptible.</description>

        <description>The Air Immaculate's  ngertips spark with electricity, his eyes flicker with the light of a faraway electrical storm, and his motions take on the sudden, unexpected aspects of lightning. When he attacks, he looses brilliant bolts of lightning at his foes, even striking targets that are far out of reach.
   For the Charm's duration, the Immaculate's Martial Arts attacks reach to a distance of (Essence x 10) feet. Such attacks inflict (Strength + Essence) in lethal electrical damage. If a target is in range for a normal unarmed attack, using a punch or kick adds to the attack's Accuracy and Damage as normal.
   For an additional mote, the Dragon-Blood may use a chakram with this Charm to add its Accuracy and Damage to the attack. Wielding such a weapon with this Charm carries the lightning strike farther. Add the Immaculate's Essence to the weapon's Range. Doing so might increase or decrease the Charm's maximum effective range, depending on the Immaculate's Essence.</description>

When they do use weapons in personal combat, they often prefer the fighting chain, using its length and flexibility to entangle and trip their opponents.
   The Air Dragon Style's signature weapon is the chakram. Chakrams come in a variety of shapes and visual styles. When each Immaculate Dragon of Air achieves his Form-type Charm for the style, he chooses his own pattern as his signature look.
   In combat, the Immaculate may hurl two chakrams as a single attack. He must have both chakrams on his person to do so, or be using an infinite jade chakram (see Exalted, p. 389). Both projectiles have a single attack roll and are treated by the target as a single attack, but if the attack hits, the target suffers damage for both. The Immaculate is able to make such an attack in concert with appropriate simple or supplemental Charms, but he must spend an additional mote to make the attack apply to both chakrams.
   Air Dragon Style may be practiced in armor.</description>

        <description>Air Immaculates unleash the hurricane on their foes through this Charm. The wind picks up around a monk until it reaches dizzying speeds, making her strides fleet, her leaps long and her blows so fast that they blur. The ferocious gusts are often strong enough to pick up small objects within a number of yards equal to the Immaculate's (Essence x 3) and  ing them away, though not at the Immaculate's conscious direction.
   For a number of actions equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts, the Immaculate moves faster and leaps farther, tripling her movement and doubling her jumping distances. (The latter stacks with the Air Aspect anima ability to provide four times the distance). Her blinding speed adds half her Martial Arts rating to her Dodge DV and halves the Speed of any Martial Arts attacks she makes. Each action, the Immaculate may make a number of extra attacks (martial arts or ranged) equal to her Essence. Each extra attack uses her full dice pool and does not prevent her from taking non-attack actions or performing an unrelated flurry. If she has Charms or Combos that can logically affect the extra attacks, she may use them, though she must still abide by the limitations on Charms per action.
   Although the Immaculate pays the Willpower and motes up front as normal, she does not suffer damage from the Charm until the Charm ends. At that time, she takes one level of unsoakable bashing damage for each action the Charm lasted.</description>

            <description>Earth Dragon is the most nakedly brutal of all the Fivefold Dragon Paths. It centers around strengthening the body, using its natural muscles to their absolutely greatest effect and inuring the skin and mind against pain of all types. Acolytes train by enduringthe worst hardships their masters can conceive, from standing on the slopes of the Imperial Mountain during a blizzard to sleeping on beds of nails and suffering brutal beatings willingly.
   The style is slower by far than its fellows. Its motions are measured and deliberate, and students take no step or strike without knowing its result beforehand. Despite the pace with which they prepare for their actions, their follow-through is as fast and thunderously unstoppable as a falling mountain.
   Earth Dragons use the tetsubo as their signature weapon, a huge war club studded with iron. They often make their own upon mastering the style's Form-type Charm, and no two Earth Immaculates' weapons look alike. The artifact version of the weapon is a great jade-laced steel club (a grand goremaul) that is usually too heavy for a mortal to even budge. Masters of the style encourage their students to study Craft and Occult so that they can more easily make their own.
   When wielding a tetsubo or a grand goremaul, Immaculates of Earth add one point to the Overwhelming quality of such a weapon. Earth Dragon Style may be practiced in armor.</description>

        <description>Pure inward focus and slow, deliberate movement precedes this attack. Many onlookers are surprised by the great damage such a sluggish blow manages to inflict.
   The Immaculate adds an amount of damage equal to his Essence on a single Melee or Martial Arts attack. He cannot use this Charm with weapons other than the Earth Dragon's signature weapons - the sledge, the tetsubo or the grand goremaul.</description>

        <description>Like the Imperial Mountain and the Realm's impervious War Manses, those who emulate Earth are eternal. Steadfast, they study the art of stillness.
   Invoking this Charm allows the Immaculate to stand stock still for the duration. Beyond its meditative use, an Immaculate using this Charm adds a number of automatic successes equal to her Essence to any attempt to resist being moved or knocked down, as from knockdown or knockback. Her ability to lock her joints and make her muscles as steel also adds these successes to any opposed check to maintain a grapple, as long as she is not attempting to break the hold.
       Remaining perfectly still can also aid attempts at concealment. As long as the Immaculate has an appropriate hiding place, she adds a like number of automatic successes to her Stealth attempt as long as she does not move. Being able to remain perfectly still might come in handy at other times, as well - such as resisting disarms or holding on for dear life - at the Storyteller's discretion.</description>

        <description>Dragons of Earth spend months training their bodies to ignore pain and resist harm. After thousands of punches made into tuns of gravel and many hours spent lying between two massive sheets of rock, they learn to channel their Essence into their skin, hardening it against misfortune.
   The Immaculate adds his Martial Arts rating to his natural lethal and bashing soak until his next action. Furthermore, hardening his skin in this way allows him to also parry weapons with his bare hands.</description>

        <description>Immaculates of Earth have an affinity for the inanimate. In many ways, they use objects as one facet of their ideal emulation: a propensity toward stillness, enduring construction and a long-term outlook.
   This unique perspective gives Immaculates an advantage when taking the inanimate apart. For the duration of the Charm, double the raw damage the Immaculate inflicts on objects (but not living things). This effect stacks with others that increase damage done to objects.</description>

        <description>Hidden stones shatter plows, and striking a mountain breaks the blade. Immaculates learn similar tactics. After the Immaculate has activated this Charm, attacking him with a weapon becomes a risky proposal.
   When the martial artist parries a weapon with this Charm, either barehanded or wielding his form weapon, his player makes a Reflexive (Strength + Martial Arts) roll to destroy the attacking weapon. He needs one success to destroy normal weapons, three for fine, exceptional or perfect weapons and five for weapons forged of the magical materials. Whether or not the Immaculate fails to destroy the weapon, its bearer's player must make a Reflexive (Wits + relevant Ability) roll opposing the Immaculate's roll or be disarmed (as per the disarming rules).
   The Essence cost of this Charm is equal to the difficulty to destroy the weapon and must be paid before the attempt. If the Exalt does not have enough Essence to use this Charm on a weapon (i.e., he thought an artifact weapon was an unremarkable sword), he spends no Essence and the Charm does not activate.</description>

            <description>Earth Dragon is the most nakedly brutal of all the Fivefold Dragon Paths. It centers around strengthening the body, using its natural muscles to their absolutely greatest effect and inuring the skin and mind against pain of all types. Acolytes train by enduringthe worst hardships their masters can conceive, from standing on the slopes of the Imperial Mountain during a blizzard to sleeping on beds of nails and suffering brutal beatings willingly.
   The style is slower by far than its fellows. Its motions are measured and deliberate, and students take no step or strike without knowing its result beforehand. Despite the pace with which they prepare for their actions, their follow-through is as fast and thunderously unstoppable as a falling mountain.
   Earth Dragons use the tetsubo as their signature weapon, a huge war club studded with iron. They often make their own upon mastering the style's Form-type Charm, and no two Earth Immaculates' weapons look alike. The artifact version of the weapon is a great jade-laced steel club (a grand goremaul) that is usually too heavy for a mortal to even budge. Masters of the style encourage their students to study Craft and Occult so that they can more easily make their own.
   When wielding a tetsubo or a grand goremaul, Immaculates of Earth add one point to the Overwhelming quality of such a weapon. Earth Dragon Style may be practiced in armor.</description>

        <description>The Immaculate's hand seems to swell and grow before he strikes the earth with an open palm. The ground shivers, and immediately after, the ground beneath his target opens up beneath her feet and to engulf and immobilize her. The Immaculate's player rolls (Strength + Martial Arts) against the target's Dodge DV - this attack cannot be parried. Each net success for the Immaculate adds one to the difficulty of all the target's physical actions.
   A target affected by the Charm cannot take Move or Dash actions until her player succeeds in a (Strength + Athletics) roll at a difficulty equal to the Immaculate's net successes, which requires a miscellaneous action at -2 DV. If the Immaculate's net successes exceed the target's Strength, the attack draws her all the way into the ground. She can take no actions but to attempt to escape, and the difficulty of the (Strength + Athletics) roll doubles. At the Immaculate's discretion, the target might not have any air in her earthen prison. If not, she must hold her breath.
   Allies may help to free a victim of this Charm, by trying to pull her from the grasping earth or prying at the stone over her head. Treat this as limited teamwork (adding one die to the escape attempt for each person helping).
   For one additional mote each, the Immaculate can target multiple enemies with a single use of this Charm. He cannot target more victims than double his Essence. Obviously, both the Immaculate and any targets must be on the same earthen or stone surface.</description>

        <description>By interrupting a target's normal Essence flows with immobile earth Essence, the Immaculate can freeze her foes in place. If the Immaculate successfully harms a target with a barehanded attack, she paralyzes and renders him inactive, completely unable to move. The victim endures a number of inactive actions (including the first) equal to the levels of damage inflicted. If this attack kills a target, it turns his body to stone. His body petrifies completely, a permanent and frightening tribute to the Immaculate's martial prowess.</description>

        <description>Channeling the heaviness of earth into his opponent, the Immaculate tries to bury her beneath his massive attacks. At the very least, he forces her to assume an inferior  ghting posture.
   On a successful attack, the Immaculate's player makes a reflexive, opposed (Strength + Martial Arts) roll against the target's (Stamina + Athletics). If the Immaculate wins or ties, he successfully pours earth Essence down on her. In addition to the normal damage inflicted by the attack, each net success on the opposed roll inflicts a -1 internal penalty to all physical actions on the victim as long as she remains in the Immaculate's line of sight. Once she escapes the Immaculate's line of sight, the weight lifts.
   If the net successes exceed the target's Stamina, the Charm immobilizes her completely. She must take only inactive actions, but only as long the Immaculate maintains physical contact with her - her form over ows with earth Essence, and he must prevent it from pouring out.
   As long as the Immaculate maintains the proper eye or physical contact, the Charm can last inde nitely. When he releases someone made completely immobile, she still suffers the Charm's internal penalties until the Immaculate uncommits the motes spent on the Charm or she leaves his line of sight. Finally, trying to take other actions while maintaining contact with a single, immobilized individual is awkward, leveling a -1 external penalty on all physical actions. Holding multiple such victims increases the penalty commensurately.
   Multiple invocations of this Charm on a single target are not cumulative. Only the most effective application counts. Earth-aspected Dragon-Blooded, already replete with earth Essence, cannot be affected by this Charm, though the attack behind it can still inflict damage.</description>

        <description>Earth is the element of stability and physicality. Touch-ing an immaterial target, the Immaculate uses his connection to the Elemental Dragon of Earth to draw this victim into the corporeal world.
   Ghost-Grounding Blow does not provide the means to strike an immaterial target, so the monk must first activate Moment of Daana'd or another Charm that allows her to strike immaterial targets. On a successful, unarmed Martial Arts attack, the Immaculate's player makes an opposed roll of (her Wits + Martial Arts + extra successes on the attack) against the target's permanent Willpower.
   If the Immaculate wins, her blow inflicts no damage but she instead forces the target into material form. When the target need spend no Essence to become corporeal (such as an elemental or Eclipse Caste Solar using Dematerialize), it happens immediately. If the target must spend Essence to don a physical form (such as ghosts, gods or demons using Materialize), the Charm forces it to spend that Essence immediately. When the target does not have enough Essence to use that power, the Immaculate must supply the rest. If the two parties combined do not have enough, both lose all their Essence, but the target remains immaterial.
   Once material, the target must remain material for a number of hours equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts Ability. She is in no way prohibited from using any Charms or powers, assuming she has the Essence to do so, apart from those that would dematerialize her.
   On a tied roll, the entity becomes material as normal but may dematerialize again (if she has that ability) on or after her next action. If the target's player wins the opposed roll, the attack has no effect at all.
   Neither gods nor demons are fond of this Charm, as it forces them into a weaker position and often precedes the Immaculate's attempts to destroy them. Creatures with permanent Essences higher than the martial artist's are immune to this Charm.</description>

            <description>Earth Dragon is the most nakedly brutal of all the Fivefold Dragon Paths. It centers around strengthening the body, using its natural muscles to their absolutely greatest effect and inuring the skin and mind against pain of all types. Acolytes train by enduringthe worst hardships their masters can conceive, from standing on the slopes of the Imperial Mountain during a blizzard to sleeping on beds of nails and suffering brutal beatings willingly.
   The style is slower by far than its fellows. Its motions are measured and deliberate, and students take no step or strike without knowing its result beforehand. Despite the pace with which they prepare for their actions, their follow-through is as fast and thunderously unstoppable as a falling mountain.
   Earth Dragons use the tetsubo as their signature weapon, a huge war club studded with iron. They often make their own upon mastering the style's Form-type Charm, and no two Earth Immaculates' weapons look alike. The artifact version of the weapon is a great jade-laced steel club (a grand goremaul) that is usually too heavy for a mortal to even budge. Masters of the style encourage their students to study Craft and Occult so that they can more easily make their own.
   When wielding a tetsubo or a grand goremaul, Immaculates of Earth add one point to the Overwhelming quality of such a weapon. Earth Dragon Style may be practiced in armor.</description>

        <description>The pinnacle of Earth Dragon Style, this Charm lets the Immaculate truly become one with the exemplar she emulates. Falling to her hands and knees, the martial artist touches her head to the ground to be fully in contact with the body of the Elemental Dragon of Earth. Her skin ripples and petrifies, making her into an Immaculate warrior of living stone.
   This Charm doubles the Immaculate's Strength and Stamina and causes his hand-to-hand attacks to inflict lethal damage. She adds her Essence to the Accuracy, Damage and Defense values of her unarmed attacks. She soaks lethal damage with her entire Stamina and adds her Essence to her bashing and lethal soak and her Hardness. Finally, being made from stone deadens the Immaculate's senses and strengthens her joints. She ignores all wound penalties and Crippling effects for the Charm's duration.
   This Charm is incompatible with armor.</description>

            <description>Devotees to the Fire Dragon suffer the cruelest of the five training regimens. They learn early on that one must control fire, lest it consume everything in its path. The best-known lesson the Fire Immaculates suffer consists of setting the student on fire. She is forbidden to use anything other than her own willpower to resist the pain as the element she wishes to emulate bubbles her flesh and melts the fat from her bones. She hears the crackling fire and smells her charred flesh, and when she can endure no more, she need only speak before she is doused and healed. In general, Immaculates believe that the longer a student remains silent, the greater a warrior she will be.
   Fire Dragons fight in a manner as wild and unpredictable as a forest fire, but the Immaculates themselves endeavor to always be in complete control. Their lessons teach them that they are the fire and to lose control would be devastating to their friends and their aims.
   The signature weapons of Fire Dragon Style are paired short swords, each curved to a claw-like point at the end. Paired short daiklaves serve as the artifact version of these weapons. An Immaculate's combat with these weapons is ferocious, and the shimmering of light off the blades often reminds observers of the flickering fires of the element behind the style.
   Immaculate Dragons of Fire become incredibly adept at using their blades for rapid slashing assaults. When one performs a flurry that consists only of attacks with their signature weapons, each attack suffers a multiple action penalty equal only to its number in the progression; i.e., the first attack suffers a -1, the second a -2 and so on. Fire Dragon Style may be practiced in armor.</description>

When one performs a flurry that consists only of attacks with their signature weapons, each attack suffers a multiple action penalty equal only to its number in the progression; i.e., the first attack suffers a -1, the second a -2 and so on.

        <description>His hand or sword sheathed in flame, the Immaculate tries to cover a foe in that burning Essence. On a successful Martial Arts strike, the Immaculate adds his Martial Arts rating to the damage, and all damage inflicted is lethal. Additionally, the target's player Reflexively rolls (Stamina + Resistance) at a difficulty of the monk's Essence. Beings with an elemental affinity for Water (such as Water-aspected Dragon-Blooded) add two dice to their Resistance rolls. If the roll fails, the target bursts into flame. Treat this effect as if the victim were standing in the middle of a bon re. She suffers four levels of lethal damage per action for a number of subsequent actions equal to the attacker's Martial Arts score. A successful (Stamina + Resistance) roll at difficulty 3 reduces the damage from lethal to bashing on each action, which ignores armor.
   The flames are magical, despite the entirely normal looks, smells, feelings and screams. Only the end of the Charm or magic (water Essence or magic that specifically douses flames) can put out the fire early. Otherwise, the poor victim will burn even underwater.</description>

            <description>Devotees to the Fire Dragon suffer the cruelest of the five training regimens. They learn early on that one must control fire, lest it consume everything in its path. The best-known lesson the Fire Immaculates suffer consists of setting the student on fire. She is forbidden to use anything other than her own willpower to resist the pain as the element she wishes to emulate bubbles her flesh and melts the fat from her bones. She hears the crackling fire and smells her charred flesh, and when she can endure no more, she need only speak before she is doused and healed. In general, Immaculates believe that the longer a student remains silent, the greater a warrior she will be.
   Fire Dragons fight in a manner as wild and unpredictable as a forest fire, but the Immaculates themselves endeavor to always be in complete control. Their lessons teach them that they are the fire and to lose control would be devastating to their friends and their aims.

        <description>Taking a deep breath and calling to rouse the Fire Dragon within her, the Immaculate spits a gout of flame that extends for a number of yards equal to her Essence. Her attack roll is her (Perception + Martial Arts), and she adds a number of automatic successes equal to her Essence. The attack inflicts a number of levels of lethal damage equal to her Essence for every mote the Fire Dragon Immaculate spends on the Charm. She cannot spend more motes than she has dots of Martial Arts. The rolling flame cannot be parried.
    By expending a point of Willpower, the Immaculate gives the Breath of the Fire Dragon the ability to affect spirits as well as material objects.</description>

        <description>This esoteric attack touches and activates a half-dozen potent chakras, causing the Essence contained within the target to  are and burn the body from within. On a successful strike, the attack does not inflict normal damage. Instead, the target suffers one level of lethal damage for every mote of Essence in her Personal Essence pool, up to a maximum of twice the Immaculate's permanent Essence. The damage ignores armor but is otherwise soaked normally. This Charm does not consume the motes involved, but simply uses them as a catalyst for damage.
   Creatures without Personal Essence pools (such as gods and mortals) are immune to this Charm.</description>

        <description>Fires cause great damage, and they are recognized and respected for their illimitable hunger across Creation. Taking this aspect of the Fire Dragon onto herself as flames swirl about her body, the Immaculate makes her foes afraid to strike her.
   While the Immaculate maintains the stance, anyone trying to attack her subtracts a number of dice equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts from his dice pool when doing so. Anyone who tries to attack one of the Immaculate's clear allies within a number of yards of the Immaculate equal to the Immaculate's Essence subtracts half that number (i.e., the Immaculate's Martial Arts score). While this Charm is active, the Immaculate can defend herself and take other actions. Making an attack or taking a Dash action ends Overwhelming Fire Majesty Stance, as does invoking any non-Reflexive Charms or moving more than half her normal movement. Taking any health levels of damage from an attack also disrupts the stance. Once the Charm ends, the effects linger for another three ticks.</description>

            <description>Immaculate Dragons of Water meld the crashing strength of the tsunami, the unutterable calm of a perfectly smooth lake and the cold, grinding force of a frozen glacier into a deadly martial arts style. Students of the style spend long hours contemplating water in all its forms: the cutting edges of ice, the flowing and indestructible nature of water, the gentle but deadly snowfall and the freeform essence of scalding steam. Swimming and sailing have their parts in the training, as a monk must come to fully understand his element.
   When they enter combat, Water Immaculates seem to melt away from their opponents' blows, run through their grasping finders and then strike with the force of a great wave. Though a single wave cannot topple a castle, Water Stylists wear their foes to the ground with an unending series of eroding strikes and kicks.
   These Immaculates wield "dragon's claws" in combat, which are effectively stylized tiger claws (or razor claws). Water Dragons are so skilled in using these weapons that their flowing movements create glittering walls of slashing steel and jade, hypnotically beautiful but of deadly consequence.
   Water Dragons wielding paired dragon's claws reduce the Speed by one and add two to the weapons' Defense. Water Dragon Style is compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>Just as a pebble thrown through the surface of a pond sends ripples washing to shore, so can the Immaculate's blow ripple through Creation. When she connects with a strike aided by this Charm, the very air appears to ripple outward from the point of contact.
   If an attack supplemented by this Charm successfully inflicts levels of damage on its target, everyone but the Immaculate within 10 feet of the target suffers dice of bashing damage equal to the number of health levels inflicted on the primary target. This damage ignores armor.
   This Charm is not discerning - friends are as susceptible as foes. When the Immaculate raises her Essence to 4, she may spend Essence to make the Charm ignore her companions and friends. For each mote spent, the ripples ignore one creature. She may not exempt more targets than she has dots of Essence.</description>

        <description>The body contains a great deal of water, in the form of sweat, tears... but mostly blood. Immaculates of Water learn the secret tides of blood, and they can strike a target in such a way that it disrupts and diverts a victim's blood. By channeling it into the target's airways and lungs, an Immaculate can actually drown his foe in her own blood.
   After a successful Martial Arts attack, which does not damage the target, the Immaculate's player (Strength + Martial Arts) opposed by the target's (Stamina + Resistance). If the Immaculate wins, his target suffers internal bleeding and loses one dot of Stamina for a number of actions equal to the Immaculate's extra successes. Subsequent uses of the Charm are cumulative, and a target reduced to 0 Stamina is dead.</description>

The Immaculate tries to mimic this perfect freedom, using this Charm to prevent herself from ever being restrained. When she uses it, mundane chains shatter, ropes snap, and handcuffs drop away. It also nullifies the effects of supernatural restraints for a number of ticks equal to the Immaculate's (Martial Arts x 3).</description>

        <description>With a few graceful body movements, the Immaculate becomes more like the liquid element he seeks to emulate. As that element, he can absorb and dissipate vast amounts of damage while suffering very little harm.
   While this Charm is active, the Exalt adds his Martial Arts to his bashing and lethal soak and soaks lethal damage with his full Stamina. Also, when successfully attacked, he may further augment his soak by Reflexively spending one mote per two points of soak. This soak applies to only a single attack, and he must spend the Essence in Step Seven of attack resolution.
   Finally, the Immaculate's flowing motions make his attacks hard to evade and his defenses even harder to predict. He adds his an amount equal to his Essence to his Martial Arts Ability for the scene. This Charm is incompatible with any armor that has a mobility penalty of -2 or greater, because such armor constrains the martial artist and prohibits the natural flow necessary for this Charm.</description>

        <description>By influencing the water Essence inside her target''s body, the Immaculate can completely -  if only for a moment - reverse the blood in a person's veins. All she need do to enact this Charm is give the target the slightest touch. Some Water Immaculates find ways to begin combat by using this Charm amidst a handshake or other friendly gesture.
   If an unarmed Martial Arts attack is successful (whether or not it inflicts any damage), the target's player rolls (Stamina + Resistance) at a difficulty equal to the Immaculate's successes on the initial attack roll, before reducing successes from the target's DVs. If the roll fails, he takes one level of unsoakable lethal damage. Whether or not the target succeeds, he loses two dice from all dice pools for a number of actions equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts.
       Mortals are less hardy than the Exalted, and those who fail the (Stamina + Resistance) roll die instantly, as do animals of less than twice the Immaculate's size. Most gods, automatons and undead have no blood and are immune to this Charm, but some (such as water elementals or creatures with great amounts of liquid in their forms) are still susceptible and take two levels of lethal damage if they fail the roll.</description>

        <description>Certain texts of Daana'd suggest seeing beings that wield Essence as self-contained eddies in Creation, small vortices of power. Immaculates teach a method for interrupting those small whorls in Creation's flow, diverting that Essence to the monk's righteous use.
   After a successful attack, the Immaculate's player rolls (Essence + Martial Arts), stealing three motes of Essence for each success from his target and adding them to his own reserves. This Essence counts as Personal for all purposes, but it may in ate his pool beyond its normal boundaries. He may use this Essence, but only on Charms from Water Dragon Style. Unused Essence gained from this Charm fades at a rate of one mote per minute.</description>

        <description>Just as a sinking ship can create a vortex that sucks down fleeing survivors, Immaculate martial artists can create a similar effect in the medium of Creation's Essence. By crafting a small ball of her water Essence and hurling it into the sea of Creation, she creates a temporary whirlpool of Essence that hinders spirits. As long as she maintains the proper stance, the effects remain.
   The Immaculate's player rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts), and the players of all spirits within (Essence x 10) yards roll the creatures' Essences. Spirits who achieve more successes than the Immaculate may ignore the effects of this Charm. Any spirit who fails the roll suffers a -1 external penalty for each success by which the Dragon-Blood's roll beats his. Additionally, each success reduces the speed of the spirit's Move and Dash actions by one yard per success, unless the spirit is moving toward the Immaculate.
   If the external penalty exceeds the spirit's Essence, the spirit becomes inactive for the duration of the Charm unless its permanent Essence is greater than the Immaculate's, in which case it suffers the normal penalties but can continue to act.
   In order to sustain this Charm, the martial artist must take a -2 external penalty to all actions. When he drops it, the Charm's effects remain for three ticks before fading.Use of this Charm is obvious to spirits.</description>

        <description>Activating this Charm allows the Immaculate to ignore all damage from any source for one tick, as he siphons the wounds into the limitless abyss of the Water Dragon. The effort is greatly draining, however, and he immediately suffers a single level of aggravated damage.
       Practitioners of Water Dragon Style save this Charm for extreme circumstances. To perform such powerful techniques carries away a piece of the soul, and Immaculates are rightly wary of such consequences.</description>

        <description>Smothering an opponent with the dousing power of pure water Essence, the Immaculate attempts to metaphorically drown and put out his opponent's magic.
   The Immaculate makes a normal Martial Arts attack. If he inflicts damage, the Immaculate's player makes an immediate (Essence + Martial Arts) roll at a difficulty of half the target's Essence. For three ticks per success, any Charms or spells affecting the target cease to operate. If the number of successes exceeds the Essence of whatever individual invoked the Charm or cast the spell, the magic is completely dispelled. The durations of inactive Charms continue to count down.
   Targets affected by this Charm can reactivate the Charms and spells that were cancelled. Unless the Charms are stackable, people who suddenly have the same Charm active twice (as Essence-Dousing Wave Attack ends) gain no special benefit. This Charm can be used on friends to subdue unwanted effects, but the Immaculate must inflict at least a single level of bashing damage to trigger the effect.</description>

        <description>Filling her lungs with the life of the Water Dragon itself, the Immaculate summons all her strength and expels a low, rumbling, water-Essence-laden shout that shakes all who stand before her.
   Tsunami Force Shout radiates out from the Immaculate in a 45-degree arc extending out a number of yards equal to her Essence, inflicting ([Essence + Martial Arts] x 2) levels of aggravated damage. The player of anyone within the area of effect makes a Reflexive Essence roll. On a botch, any damage dice not soaked in Step Seven of attack resolution are automatic successes. If the Essence roll fails, the damage is soaked and rolled normally. If the roll succeeds, the damage becomes lethal instead of aggravated and is rolled normally. With a threshold of three or more on the Essence roll, the damage is bashing.</description>

            <description>Followers of the Wood Dragon are mysteries among the mysterious. All Immaculates are curiosities for their dedication and their great power, but Wood Dragon Style practitioners exemplify the strangeness that follows Dragon-Blooded monks, often even to their fellows. Their training is no small part of this perception: Immaculates of Wood go far to understand the extremes of life and death, participating in both food and water deprivation and gluttony, and most also consume absurd quantities of hallucinogenic drugs while seeking the purity of Sextes Jylis.
   To observers, Wood Dragon Style is not a particularly deadly or effective style. Immaculates who practice it rarely fell their opponents in a single strike or send their opponents fleeing a storm of blows. Yet, they win their combats nonetheless. With the power they hold over the flows and ebbs of life through Creation, the wise fear them.
   An Immaculate of Wood fires her signature weapon, the bow, with deadly accuracy. Their training teaches them to fire backward, with the bow vertical or horizontal, from the saddle or while lying down, among others. When an Immaculate masters Wood Dragon Form, she usually constructs her own bow as a part of a ritual. Those who can construct powerbows often do so for their comrades.
   When using her signature weapon, an Immaculate of the Wood Dragon adds two to its Damage bonus and 25 yards to its Range. This style may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>The Wood Immaculate is master of the patterns that govern life and survival. By using this Charm to examine a single foe, the Dragon-Blood finds that foe's weakest points. After invoking this Charm, the Immaculate must successfully attack his target within his five next actions or the Charm ends with no effect. On a successful attack, the Immaculate adds her Essence as separate damage dice. This extra damage bypasses armor but may be soaked by Stamina and other sources of Hardness normally.
   This attack affects immaterial spirits as if they had materialized. Also, this Charm is only effective against living beings - automata and the dead do not bear the life paths that this Charm uses.</description>

        <description>Followers of the Wood Dragon master the flow of life within their own bodies early in their training, healing minor wounds and bruises with ease by focusing wood Essence on that location to improve healing. For every two motes spent, the Immaculate heal one level of bashing damage that she has suffered.</description>

            <description>Followers of the Wood Dragon are mysteries among the mysterious. All Immaculates are curiosities for their dedication and their great power, but Wood Dragon Style practitioners exemplify the strangeness that follows Dragon-Blooded monks, often even to their fellows. Their training is no small part of this perception: Immaculates of Wood go far to understand the extremes of life and death, participating in both food and water deprivation and gluttony, and most also consume absurd quantities of hallucinogenic drugs while seeking the purity of Sextes Jylis.
   To observers, Wood Dragon Style is not a particularly deadly or effective style. Immaculates who practice it rarely fell their opponents in a single strike or send their opponents fleeing a storm of blows. Yet, they win their combats nonetheless. With the power they hold over the flows and ebbs of life through Creation, the wise fear them.
   An Immaculate of Wood fires her signature weapon, the bow, with deadly accuracy. Their training teaches them to fire backward, with the bow vertical or horizontal, from the saddle or while lying down, among others. When an Immaculate masters Wood Dragon Form, she usually constructs her own bow as a part of a ritual. Those who can construct powerbows often do so for their comrades.
   When using her signature weapon, an Immaculate of the Wood Dragon adds two to its Damage bonus and 25 yards to its Range. This style may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>Immaculates see the Wood Dragon as more than the font of life in Creation - they also see its exemplar as a warrior without peer who can use the power of the trees to shield himself. After activating this Charm, the Immaculate adds his Martial Arts rating to his bashing soak and soaks lethal damage with his full Stamina until his next action.</description>

        <description>To enact this Charm, the Immaculate need only touch her opponent, nothing heavier than a caress, and spend the Essence. The target feels a sharp pain in his head, but nothing more. In combat, touching a target thus requires a successful attack.
   For the remainder of the scene, the Immaculate gains an automatic success on any attack she makes against a target who has been branded. Multiple soul mark effects are cumulative.
   Soul marking is especially painful to spirits - as painful as a real brand is to mortals. In addition to the other effects, this Charm endows spirits with a (cumulative) -1 internal penalty due to the searing pain that refuses to go away.
   For 24 hours after branding a target, the Immaculate can sense the direction to any being she has branded. The Immaculate adds a number of dice equal to her Essence to attempts to track such a subject, or she gains the ability to take part in a supernatural tracking contest. When such a being is within a number of yards equal to the martial artist's Essence, the martial artist can tell approximately where, and which being, it is.</description>

        <description>Striking his own body in a series of precise, quick blows, the Immaculate removes all blocks on the flow of wood Essence through his frame. Even the tiniest misplacement of one such strike causes the Charm to fail. Thereafter, the Dragon-Blood almost glows with life, and green Essence sometimes  ashes in his eyes or trails behind his body as he moves.
   While Wood Dragon Form is active, the Immaculate regenerates one health level of bashing damage on every action and one health level of lethal damage every other action. If the monk is slain, the Charm ends, and he stops regenerating.</description>

        <description>The motions associated with this Charm resemble both the way vines grow up trees in the Southeastern jungles and the movements of Southern snakes. So mesmerizing are the Immaculate's katas that she trans xes her opponents, rooting them to the spot.
   The character's player rolls her (Charisma + Martial Arts + Essence) against the Dodge MDVs of all who can see her clearly. As long as the Immaculate continues to exercise the kata, those whose MDVs were not hardy enough become inactive as they do nothing other than stare at her with rapt fascination. While executing the kata, the Immaculate may speak, move at half pace or dodge with a -2 DV penalty. Any other action ends the Charm. Wood Immaculates often use this Charm to close with an opponent before attacking.</description>

        <description>Certain pressure points cause a subject to relax uncontrollably, momentarily losing all motivation to move or act. If the Immaculate makes a successful Martial Arts attack on his target, his player does not roll damage. Instead, add the Exalt's Essence to the number of successes on the attack (before reduction from DV). Should this value top the target's MDV, the target is enthralled and becomes inactive for a number of actions equal to the Charm's extra successes.
   In subsequent actions, the target's player can attempt to have the target shake off the effects by rolling (Willpower + Integrity) at a difficulty of (1 + the successes rolled by the Immaculate's player on the opposed roll). This Charm works only on living creatures.</description>

        <description>When combating a spirit, the Wood Immaculate's understand-ing of spirit Essence allows her to channel her own Essence through an attack into the spirit. Once there, that Essence blossoms and grows, temporarily disrupting the spirit's form.
   On a successful Martial Arts attack that inflicts at least one level of damage, the Immaculate's player makes a Reflexive (Essence + Martial Arts) roll against a difficulty equal to the spirit's permanent Essence. The spirit loses a number of dice from all actions equal to the roll's threshold. This penalty fades at the rate of one die per action the spirit takes. This Charm is able to strike immaterial spirits.</description>

        <description>As a thin vine grows along a wall and inevitably destroys it, the Immaculate is able to tighten his Essence around a spirit-foe and tear its core to shreds. On a successful attack against a spirit, the Wood Immaculate does not inflict damage normally. Instead, her player rolls her (Essence + Willpower) at a difficulty of the spirit's Essence. Success indicates that the spirit suffers one level of aggravated damage. For every additional number of successes equal to target's Essence that the roll garners, the spirit suffers another aggravated health level. Spirits reduced to Incapacitated by such an attack are permanently destroyed.</description>

            <description>Followers of the Wood Dragon are mysteries among the mysterious. All Immaculates are curiosities for their dedication and their great power, but Wood Dragon Style practitioners exemplify the strangeness that follows Dragon-Blooded monks, often even to their fellows. Their training is no small part of this perception: Immaculates of Wood go far to understand the extremes of life and death, participating in both food and water deprivation and gluttony, and most also consume absurd quantities of hallucinogenic drugs while seeking the purity of Sextes Jylis.
   To observers, Wood Dragon Style is not a particularly deadly or effective style. Immaculates who practice it rarely fell their opponents in a single strike or send their opponents fleeing a storm of blows. Yet, they win their combats nonetheless. With the power they hold over the flows and ebbs of life through Creation, the wise fear them.
   An Immaculate of Wood fires her signature weapon, the bow, with deadly accuracy. Their training teaches them to fire backward, with the bow vertical or horizontal, from the saddle or while lying down, among others. When an Immaculate masters Wood Dragon Form, she usually constructs her own bow as a part of a ritual. Those who can construct powerbows often do so for their comrades.
   When using her signature weapon, an Immaculate of the Wood Dragon adds two to its Damage bonus and 25 yards to its Range. This style may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>Attuning herself to the pattern of souls around her, her mastery over wood Essence allows her to also detect the patterns of death - death that has occurred, or death that impends.
   For the rest of the scene, the Immaculate may Reflexively spend a single mote to ignore all penalties to her Dodge DV against a single attack. She may do so no more than a number of times equal to her Essence between actions. She can dodge attacks only by beings that possess a spirit, however (including most undead). She cannot dodge traps, falling rocks or attacks by automata. Finally, she cannot dodge ranged attacks made from beyond a radius equal to her Essence in yards.</description>

        <description>The Immaculate uses this meditation technique to absorb others' wounds into his own body, where he can then heal them. All the Dragon-Blood must do is touch the injured subject and temporarily merge their Essences. The target then heals one health level for every three motes the Immaculate spends, and the wounds immediately appear on the martial artist's body. Such a gracious act is not without its reward, and the Immaculate immediately suffers the appropriate wound penalties. Wood Immaculates can, of course, heal those injuries with Wood Dragon Form or Mind-over-Body Meditation, unless the wounds are aggravated.</description>

        <description>The highest mastery of Wood Dragon Style, this Charm is little more than a legend to most, even other Dragon-Blooded Immaculate monks. Few who see the Charm active live to tell others, because the perfect alignment of a Wood Immaculate with the forces of life gives her the power to completely and utterly end it.
   After activating this Charm, a swirling, sizzling green-black aura lingers on the Immaculate's hands for a number of actions equal to his Essence. During that time, the Immaculate must successfully touch her target, either casually (if her victim is not expecting an attack) or as part of a hand-to-hand attack that inflicts normal damage. Once she does so, the Immaculate's player makes a Reflexive (Essence + Martial Arts) roll against the opponent's (Stamina + Resistance). If the target loses, his soul becomes completely dissociated from his body, instantly killing him. Even if he wins, the attack still inflicts dice of aggravated damage equal to the Immaculate's Essence.
   In addition to its effects on living creatures, spirits with a permanent Essence lower than or equal to that of the Immaculate are even more susceptible to Soul Mastery. Should the Immaculate strike such a spirit, her wrath rips its Essence asunder, permanently destroying it. Gods and elementals can sense the presence of Exalted who have mastered this Charm, and they fear them intensely.
   Soul Mastery is harsh on the Immaculate. Beyond the considerable toll it demands, an Exalt must unleash the power on a target lest it destroy her own soul. Failure to discharge the effect on another target within the time allotted by the Charm forces the Immaculate to resist its effects herself.</description>

            <description>This ancient style was invented immediately in the wake of the Primordial War by the Solar Queen Merela. The marginalization of the Dragon Kings had begun even then. Although the Solar kingdom of Ochre Fountain had its capital at Rathess, the prehuman masters of the world were already accorded largely ceremonial positions at most Solar courts. It was clear that the Unconquered Sun's favor had shifted from his Dragon King devotees to their former human slaves.
       Queen Merela summoned the mightiest champions of the Dragon King race to Rathess on the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the War. There she faced them in a freestyle sparring match that lasted from the rising of the sun to its setting. Many lay dead by the end of the battle, their lives made into devotions to the Unconquered Sun. All who survived, however, had opened their souls to the Bulb of the Perfected Lotus and learned the rudiments of the style the Solar Queen used to defeat them. Merela selected the most skillful Dragon King she had fought, Klasshak of the White Claw (so named for a wound received in the War, which had leached all color from his right arm), and bequeathed to him full mastery of the style she had invented. Eye of Heaven Style, she explained, was her gift to the Dragon Kings, whom she had grown up among and fought alongside. By proxy, it was also the thanks of the Unconquered Sun.
       Klasshak was the first Dragon King master of the style, but far from the last. Almost every Dragon King capable of practicing Celestial martial arts during the First Age studied at least to the Form-type Charm of this style. Its practice waned in the wake of the Usurpation, as the inescapable knowledge that the Unconquered Sun had turned his face from the world gnawed at the heart of the Dragon Kings, allowing a spiritual malaise to set in. Finally, it was almost lost altogether in the Contagion.
    Eye of Heaven Style is now practiced by a bare handful of Dragon Kings in Yu-Shan, some very ancient gods, one Gold Faction Sidereal, and almost no one else. The return of the Solars, however, could precipitate a resurgence of the style, renewing the ties between the Lawgivers and the Dragon Kings... or they style might simply pass from memory, one more lost relic of the First Age. Only time will tell.
   Weapons and Armor: The exactingly calibrated Charms of this style treat attacks made with the sword-club, swordstick (see Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, pp. 22 and 23) and orichalcum reaver daiklave as unarmed. This style may be practiced in armor.</description>

        <description>In the time before man, the hardy Dragon Kings ruled over a far more primal and violent world. Cracks in the earth vented scalding gas. Volcanoes spat their fury at a darkened sky. The seas struck angrily at the shore, and the earth quaked unceasingly with the Earth Dragon's movements. And yet, the Dragon Kings not only endured, they thrived. Creation is now a gentler place, but the rugged prowess of its  original masters has not been forgotten. This technique emulates it.
   The martial artist raises his natural lethal and bashing soak against one form of damage for the rest of the scene by an amount equal to his Essence. Specific examples might include all the attacks of a single opponent, attacks from one broad class of weapon (daiklaves, spears, arrows), damage from a specific poison or environmental damage of a particular kind. If this Charm is used to resist environmental damage, double the soak benefit.</description>

        <description>The prehuman era was a time of endless war, as reptilian warriors clashed for supremacy, for honor and for the glory of the sun that shone down on their blood-spattered battlefields. To endure and grow strong was a sign of both prowess and devotion. This Charm emulates such a steadfast ascension, permitting the martial artist to stand toe-to-toe with his enemies and emerge triumphant. When invoked, it eliminates all Martial Arts and Melee-based onslaught penalties for the rest of the tick.</description>

This Charm emulates the raw strength of the Dragon Kings at the height of their civilization, before the coming of the Exalted. An unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm raises its minimum damage value by one, plus one for each point of wound penalties suffered by the target.</description>

        <description>The Unconquered Sun shines down upon the triumphant and the defeated, the glorious and the cowardly, and passes his judgment. So it is with the martial artist - he goes confidently to war, his eye on every aspect of the battlefield, his strength forcing all to kneel before him. A martial artist who assumes the Eye of Heaven Form raises both his Perception and his Strength by an amount equal to his Martial Arts rating. This benefit counts as dice added by a Charm.</description>

            <description>This ancient style was invented immediately in the wake of the Primordial War by the Solar Queen Merela. The marginalization of the Dragon Kings had begun even then. Although the Solar kingdom of Ochre Fountain had its capital at Rathess, the prehuman masters of the world were already accorded largely ceremonial positions at most Solar courts. It was clear that the Unconquered Sun's favor had shifted from his Dragon King devotees to their former human slaves.
       Queen Merela summoned the mightiest champions of the Dragon King race to Rathess on the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the War. There she faced them in a freestyle sparring match that lasted from the rising of the sun to its setting. Many lay dead by the end of the battle, their lives made into devotions to the Unconquered Sun. All who survived, however, had opened their souls to the Bulb of the Perfected Lotus and learned the rudiments of the style the Solar Queen used to defeat them. Merela selected the most skillful Dragon King she had fought, Klasshak of the White Claw (so named for a wound received in the War, which had leached all color from his right arm), and bequeathed to him full mastery of the style she had invented. Eye of Heaven Style, she explained, was her gift to the Dragon Kings, whom she had grown up among and fought alongside. By proxy, it was also the thanks of the Unconquered Sun.
       Klasshak was the first Dragon King master of the style, but far from the last. Almost every Dragon King capable of practicing Celestial martial arts during the First Age studied at least to the Form-type Charm of this style. Its practice waned in the wake of the Usurpation, as the inescapable knowledge that the Unconquered Sun had turned his face from the world gnawed at the heart of the Dragon Kings, allowing a spiritual malaise to set in. Finally, it was almost lost altogether in the Contagion.

        <description>The Dragon Kings set their strength willingly against the Primordials for the glory of the Unconquered Sun. They eagerly acted as the blade of his Chosen, and they were broken. In remembrance of those who have fallen forever, the martial artist forces his opponents to relive their defeat. This Charm permits the martial artist to make a standard unarmed disarm attempt against an opponent, replacing Dexterity with Strength on the roll if he so desires. If successful, however, rather than a simple disarm, the opponent's weapon is shattered into useless fragments. If the target bears an attuned artifact, then rather than being shattered, the weapon is forcefully deattuned and cannot be reattuned for the rest of the scene. Essence-forged weapons such as the Glorious Solar Saber are instantly dispelled and must be reinvoked if the target wishes to continue using them.</description>

        <description>The Dragon Kings marched in their teeming millions for the glory of the champions of the Unconquered Sun. They took the first blow for the army of the gods and were shattered thereby. In remembrance of those who have fallen forever, the martial artist forces his opponents to relive their defeat. This Charm permits the martial artist to make a standard unarmed attack against a target. Should the attack successfully connect, the martial artist targets his opponent's armor rather than the one wearing it, permanently reducing its soak values by an amount equal to his raw damage. Should this amount match or exceed the armor's total soak, the armor is destroyed.
       Magical armor is hardier. Attuned artifacts suffer no penalty unless the martial artist's raw damage meets or exceeds the armor's highest soak value, in which case it suffers partial deattunement, raising its mobility and fatigue penalties by three each until the wearer can properly re-attune it. Essence-forged armor (such as Glorious Solar Plate) is instantly dispelled if its soak values are exceeded.</description>

        <description>To die in service of the Unconquered Sun is glorious indeed, but for the Dragon Kings, death was meant to be a period of rest between lives of glorious heroism. The Primordials tore asunder the souls of brave warriors by the tens of millions, and no greater atrocity has ever been known. The martial artist does not possess the power or the will to visit such atrocity on his enemies, but he can give them the slightest taste of dissolution of the soul. An unarmed attack enhanced by this Charm, should it connect, destroys a number of the target's motes equal to (the final damage of the attack x 2), targeting Personal Essence before Peripheral.</description>

        <description>Though sore tested by the rigors of the War, the Dragon Kings ultimately stood triumphant alongside the Dragon-Blooded, Sidereals, Lunars and Solars, their heroism to be commemorated in public record and past-life memories for all time. The knowledge of such travails empowers the martial artist. No opposition could daunt a soul that survived the War. For the duration of this Charm, the martial artist is immune to coordinated attack penalties, and her Parry DV is raised to its full value and immunized against penalties of any sort. (As always, remember that inapplicability is not a penalty).</description>

        <description>Though bloodied by the greatest of trials, the Dragon Kings endure. Their hope for the future is the same as their hope for the past, rooted in their devotion to the Unconquered Sun and alliance with his mighty Chosen. This Charm is the ultimate expression of that devotion. When used to supplement a barehanded attack, that attack inflicts lethal damage if it did not already, and doubles its total pre-soak damage. Should the attack kill its target, the martial artist automatically rips out the victim's heart with her bare hands and offers it up to the Unconquered Sun. This gesture counts as an automatically successful prayer without the need for a prayer roll.</description>

            <description>Just as the other kinds of Exalted, the Sidereals possess their own distinctive style of supernatural martial arts. However, the Viziers do not speak of a "Sidereal Hero Style" of supernatural martial arts. Instead, they call the Martial Arts Charms they received from the Maidens the Violet Bier of Sorrows Style. The Sidereals believe it is the first of all supernatural martial arts.
   The Violet Bier of Sorrows Style is a Celestial martial art. A Sidereal sifu could teach it to anyone who could learn such martial arts - most notably, other Celestial Exalted or Dragon-Blooded trained as Immaculate martial artists - but the elders of the Five-Score Fellowship all forbid this, regardless of their faction. Teaching the style to anyone except other Sidereals or authorized gods in the Bureau of Destiny is a Severity 4 offense.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks with knives, swords, staves and seven-section staves (and all their artifact versions) as unarmed attacks. These Charms do not function if the character wears armor.</description>

As part of the roll, the martial artist may reflexively draw any form weapon of this style.</description>

            <description>Just as the other kinds of Exalted, the Sidereals possess their own distinctive style of supernatural martial arts. However, the Viziers do not speak of a "Sidereal Hero Style" of supernatural martial arts. Instead, they call the Martial Arts Charms they received from the Maidens the Violet Bier of Sorrows Style. The Sidereals believe it is the first of all supernatural martial arts.
   The Violet Bier of Sorrows Style is a Celestial martial art. A Sidereal sifu could teach it to anyone who could learn such martial arts - most notably, other Celestial Exalted or Dragon-Blooded trained as Immaculate martial artists - but the elders of the Five-Score Fellowship all forbid this, regardless of their faction. Teaching the style to anyone except other Sidereals or authorized gods in the Bureau of Destiny is a Severity 4 offense.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks with knives, swords, staves and seven-section staves (and all their artifact versions) as unarmed attacks. These Charms do not function if the character wears armor.</description>

        <description>Scarlet Essence flares around the Vizier, giving her the fate of an armed and armored warrior. For the rest of the scene, the character's Martial Arts attacks (including clinches) inflict lethal damage. The character can also parry lethal damage from physical attacks (including ranged attacks) without using a weapon or stunt. What's more, every two motes spent on this Charm add one die to each unarmed Martial Arts attack, and one to the pool used to calculate Parry Defense Value. For this Charm alone, the maximum number of dice added rises to (Dexterity + Martial Arts) - but only for Martial Arts, and only if the character does not wear armor (even if the Seer uses Martial Arts Charms from a style that permits armor, such as the Earth Dragon Style described in The Manual of Exalted Power - The Dragon-Blooded).</description>

            <description>Crimson ribbons of Essence trail from the Sidereal's hands, the strands of a martial destiny waiting to be seized. This crimson nimbus allows the martial artist to both deal lethal damage and parry lethal attacks while unarmed, and enchants her natural attacks with the traits of a stametal daiklave (except for clinches).
   Alternatively, the martial artist may invoke this Charm to invoke a form weapon she wields, granting it the magical material bonus of starmetal and rendering it as indestructible as an attuned artifact. It also benefits from the reduced target number for damage.</description>

        <description>Not only does the Sidereal laugh in her opponents' faces when they fail to do her harm, Creation itself rewards her for her combat skills. While the Charm is active, the player rolls the character's permanent Essence whenever an opponent's attack fails to overcome the character's Defense Value. Each success on the roll replenishes two motes of spent Essence.
   The character must face true adversity in order to enjoy this Charm's benefits. If an attack isn't truly intended to harm the Sidereal - such as in a friendly sparring match - or if the enemy is too weak to do the Sidereal any harm, the Sidereal receives no Essence.</description>

            <description>Each moment's survival is a small happiness to one who walks constantly with peril and misfortune. While Joy in Adversity Stance is active, the martial artist gains one bonus die on her next unarmed Martial Arts attack every time she successfully dodges an attack. Attacks with the Overwhelming tag instead confer two dice when dodged. These bonus dice count as dice added by a Charm, and are discharged at when the martial artist next attacks.
   Attacks must be made with hostile intent against the martial artist and be capable of harming her in order to trigger this Charm. Using a defense with a Flaw of Invulnerability ends this Charm’s duration prematurely.</description>

        <description>With grim detachment, the character takes a stance emulating that of Saturn herself when she makes her Sign over someone whose time has passed. While he uses this Charm, the character's minimum damage becomes equal to his Martial Arts score if that number exceeds his Essence or a value provided by his weapon.
   While the Sidereal uses this Form, successful Martial Arts attacks that inflict damage also strip away a target's Virtue dots. The Sidereal's player chooses which Virtue to affect, and the target loses one dot of that Virtue as he suffers damage (to a minimum of 1 in the affected Virtue's rating). Against Exalted targets, this effect cannot reduce a Virtue low enough to invalidate the Great Curse. Stripped-away Virtue dots return at a rate of one point per day.</description>

While Violet Bier of Sorrows Form is active, the martial artist gains the following benefits:
• All enemies see their own end in her, doubling any wound penalties they take on actions to oppose her in combat. Resisting this unnatural Emotion for one scene costs two Willpower.
• Any unarmed attack she makes against a spirit consumes one of the spirit's motes for every level of damage dealt.
• The character's unarmed martial arts attacks gain an Overwhelming value of (the lower of her Essence or Martial Arts rating).</description>

        <description>The weave of the character's fate becomes less rigid in combat, allowing the strands to spread out and absorb what would normally be a lethal stroke. This uncertainty of fate will not save a character's life from a mortal wound but does give her an extra instant in which to turn aside an attack that penetrated her defenses.
   If the Sidereal's Defense Value fails to save her from an opponent's attack and that attack's damage roll scores successes in Step 8 of attack resolution, the Sidereal may reflexively activate this Charm. When she does so, she reduces the damage the attack inflicts on her by one health level per two motes of Essence spent. Witnesses to this effect don't see wounds open and heal before their eyes. Instead, they see the attack come incredibly close to dealing the Sidereal a serious wound before the Sidereal's weapon knocks the attack safely aside, trailing a swath of purple Essence behind the weapon.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal hits his victim with such skilled ferocity that the weave of fate around the target reverberates several times, replaying the moment of the attack several different ways in quick succession. For each set of three motes the Sidereal spends, he may attempt an extra Martial Arts attack on the same target at his full dice pool. The Sidereal can make no more attacks than he has dots of Martial Arts, and he cannot split his original or extra actions into a flurry.</description>

        <description>Reading his opponent's movements in the weave of fate, the Sidereal interrupts his attack with a nigh-preemptive counterattack. If he's a skilled enough combatant, the Sidereal not only can weave over his opponent's attack but can supplant it with an attack of his own. When the Sidereal's foe attacks, the Sidereal may reflexively defend himself with this Charm, his player rolling his own (Dexterity + Martial Arts) pool in a contest against the attacker's attack roll. After taking successes out of the attacker's roll based on the Sidereal's normal Parry Defense Value, the Sidereal's successes on this roll then cancel out leftover successes from the attack roll one for one. If the Sidereal's Parry Defense Value and (Dexterity + Martial Arts) result cancels out all of the attacker's successes and still has successes left over, those extra successes are applied against the original attacker as a counterattack.
   The Sidereal cannot use this Charm against a counterattack, and he must be physically able to attack his foe.</description>

In Step 8 of attack resolution, when the player rolls the attack's damage, he can activate this Charm. He may then buy automatic successes on this roll for two motes of Essence per additional health level. A character may purchase no more automatic successes than he has dots of Essence.</description>

Add (Essence) to the raw damage of an unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm. The same amount is also added to the minimum damage of the attack, granting it the Overwhelming tag.
   A character reduced to their Incapacitated level by an attack supplemented with Life-Severing Blow can be unmade as a Shaping effect, killing them instantly and reducing their corpse to ash. Against mortals, even a single level of damage is sufficient to shape them dead.</description>

        <description>When a Sidereal uses this Charm, she gains strength of purpose whenever her successful attacks bring her opponent closer to his inevitable ending. Whenever a successful Martial Arts attack inflicts damage on an opponent, the Sidereal regains a point of spent Willpower. Using this Charm also helps speed a target to his life's conclusion by tripling his wound penalties as they relate to the Sidereal using the Charm. (That is, while the victim's wound penalties would be normal in an attack against a different person, attacks made against the Sidereal using this Charm suffer the tripled penalty).
   Using a prayer strip is not necessary with this Charm, since it represents the culmination of a Celestial martial art, but a Sidereal who knows this Charm can augment it with a prayer strip (hence the use of the keyword). The character uses a strip on which is written the Scripture of the Expectant Maiden, infusing the strip with Essence when he activates the Charm and affixing the prayer strip to his weapon. The strip glows burgundy and conforms to the shape of the surface to which the strip is attached. While the prayer strip survives, successful attacks made with that weapon (or with the character's fist if he wraps the strip around it) subtract one Willpower point from the target. Also, the weapon cannot be destroyed.
   If the target exists outside fate or has been reduced to zero Willpower points, using a prayer strip thus with this Charm subtracts 10 motes of Essence on a successful attack instead. If the target does not have 10 motes of Essence to lose, all of the attacker's unsoaked damage dice are inflicted as levels of damage instead.
   Note: The prayer strip aspect of this Charm can only be used by Sidereals, or by Eclipse of Moonshadow Castes who learn Conclusion-Pursuing Approach as a Sidereal Charm rather than as a supernatural martial arts Charm. This is part of the Sidereal Exaltation, not the training in Martial Arts and Essence control that underlies the other Charms of the style.</description>
        <comment>The Scripture Of The Expectant Maiden
   Once, there was a maiden...
   ...who was always looking forward to the way things would be.
   She said, "Someday, I'm getting out of this place.
   "Someday, I'm going to kill that boy that put me here.
   "And while I wait, I don't much mind,'cause it's better to dream tomorrow than to be there".
                              ***
   "I'm holding at bay", she said,
   "what I know to be true.
   "That I'll never get out.
   "I won't let my dreams die!
   "I'll hang on to hope", she said,
   "until Time itself ends. But -"
   "There's always an ending", said Time.</comment>

            <description>At the pinnacle of the Violet Bier of Sorrows, the martial artist learns to draw strength from the pain of others. As her enemies falter before her before her blows, her resolve only increases. This Charm upgrades Violet Bier of Sorrows Form. As the character invokes it, she may pay a surcharge of ten motes and a point of Willpower to add the following effects to the form:
• The martial artist's unarmed attacks deal aggravated damage to creatures outside of fate and consume their motes as though they were spirits.
• Wound penalties are tripled by the unnatural mental influence of Violet Bier of Sorrows Form instead of just double. The cost to resist rises to five Willpower.
   A Sidereal may affix a prayer strip marked with the Scripture of the Expectant Maiden to her weapon with her own blood as she invokes this Charm, causing the blade to glow with a radiant burgundy light. Doing so grants additional benefits as a Prayer Strip effect: Whenever the Sidereal damages a character with an unarmed attack, they lose a point of Willpower. Characters without remaining Willpower instead lose ten motes, and can be shaped dead as per Life-Severing Blow if they have no motes remaining.</description>

            <description>This supernatural martial art comes naturally to the Lunar Exalted. Although it is a complete style, Lunars (and their players) may design custom Charms that bridge off of this style. (See the expansion Charms on pp. 151-152 for examples). Other Exalted may not.
       Lunar Hero Style is best practiced only with natural weapons. Lunar Exalted often use the claws, teeth, hooves or horns of the Deadly Beastman Transformations with it, but other Exalted rarely have that capability. Practitioners may emulate this with tiger claws, even to the point of being usable with Charms. Because they are not truly part of the warrior, tiger claws (and razor claws) lose their accuracy bonus when used with this style.
       Practitioners other than Lunars substitute their Martial Arts rating for the Dexterity requirements for this style. This does not extend to any Lunar Charms outside this style: Eclipse and Moonshadow Caste Exalted must still possess the minimum Dexterity requirement to learn Lunar Charms that branch off from this basic tree.</description>

Against an opponent within hand-to-hand range, the Lunar's skilled footwork prevents the opponent from moving away from the character. The target's player rolls (Dexterity + Athletics) at a difficulty of the Lunar's Dexterity. Failure indicates that he cannot move away from the Lunar until his next action. Foot-Trapping Counter does not function against other Charms that allow a character to Reflexively retreat.</description>

            <description>This supernatural martial art comes naturally to the Lunar Exalted. Although it is a complete style, Lunars (and their players) may design custom Charms that bridge off of this style. (See the expansion Charms on pp. 151-152 for examples). Other Exalted may not.
       Lunar Hero Style is best practiced only with natural weapons. Lunar Exalted often use the claws, teeth, hooves or horns of the Deadly Beastman Transformations with it, but other Exalted rarely have that capability. Practitioners may emulate this with tiger claws, even to the point of being usable with Charms. Because they are not truly part of the warrior, tiger claws (and razor claws) lose their accuracy bonus when used with this style.
       Practitioners other than Lunars substitute their Martial Arts rating for the Dexterity requirements for this style. This does not extend to any Lunar Charms outside this style: Eclipse and Moonshadow Caste Exalted must still possess the minimum Dexterity requirement to learn Lunar Charms that branch off from this basic tree.</description>

        <description>Drawing the Essence of Luna into her, the Exalt becomes an endlessly fluid warrior, seamlessly flowing from one movement to the next and capable of surprising her targets with every blow. The character reduces Defense Value penalties from onslaught by 1 and from coordinated attacks by 2. Her attacks often catch people from behind while she stands in front or strike at her enemies through innocuous objects and scenery. Double the dice bonus (but not Essence reward) for stunts of this nature.</description>

        <description>With either a single swipe or a flurry of blows, the Lunar's attack moves so quickly that it tears through even steel armor as though it were paper. This attack target's a foe's armor, rather than the person wearing it. Only soak from armor reduces the attack's raw damage, and (unlike normal attacks) this can reduce the attack's dice to zero. Then, roll unsoaked damage normally. Each level of damage remaining in Step 10 of attack resolution reduces the armor's soak (bashing and lethal). Mundane armor remains damaged until repaired; armor constructed from the magical materials recovers its full soak value at the end of the scene.
   When a target's soak from armor drops to zero, the Lunar may rend the target's natural soak. The Lunar looses blows so rapid they weaken the victim's body through and through; each success rolled on damage reduces the target's effective Stamina by one. This only affects the target's soak values, not any other aspect of health.</description>

So long as the character is no farther than two move actions from the target and can physically get to her, the Lunar dashes to close the distance. He adds half his Dexterity to the target's Defense Value against the incoming attack.</description>

        <description>In a combination of leading the attack, fooling her attacker and quickly dodging out of the way, the Lunar redirects an attack on her person toward someone else. The Lunar must be aware of the attack, which must have another valid target within (Dexterity) yards of the attack. The Lunar's player rolls (Dexterity + Athletics) at a difficulty of the attacker's Perception. Success indicates that she redirects that attack, with all of its successes and effects, at another valid target of her choice. That attack then plays out as normal.</description>

            <description>This supernatural martial art comes naturally to the Lunar Exalted. Although it is a complete style, Lunars (and their players) may design custom Charms that bridge off of this style. (See the expansion Charms on pp. 151-152 for examples). Other Exalted may not.
       Lunar Hero Style is best practiced only with natural weapons. Lunar Exalted often use the claws, teeth, hooves or horns of the Deadly Beastman Transformations with it, but other Exalted rarely have that capability. Practitioners may emulate this with tiger claws, even to the point of being usable with Charms. Because they are not truly part of the warrior, tiger claws (and razor claws) lose their accuracy bonus when used with this style.
       Practitioners other than Lunars substitute their Martial Arts rating for the Dexterity requirements for this style. This does not extend to any Lunar Charms outside this style: Eclipse and Moonshadow Caste Exalted must still possess the minimum Dexterity requirement to learn Lunar Charms that branch off from this basic tree.</description>

        <description>After activating this Charm, the character becomes a ravenous, unstoppable beast. The character's move and dash actions triple in distance, and the player adds one automatic success to all Dexterity actions. Each action, the character suffers one level of lethal damage and must attempt three Martial Arts attacks or one attack and one non-attack flurry. Players of characters under the effects of this Charm must roll (Willpower) at difficulty of the character's Valor in order to take any non-attack action without ending the Charm.</description>

If Running Through the Herd fails to redirect the attack, the attacker affects his original target as intended.</description>

        <description>To strike at a Steward brings swift retribution. Bending and moving with a snake's grace, the Lunar smoothly redirects an attack back toward its instigator. The attacker must be within the character's Melee or Martial Arts range. The Lunar may dodge into a blow and then shove the blade into her opponent or scamper through her foe's legs so he shoots himself in the foot - good stunts are the nature of this Charm.
   Using this Charm allows the character to ignore all penalties to her defense against a single attack. As long as the character can successfully dodge or parry the attack, she counterattacks by forcing her enemy to suffer his own attack. Counterattack resolution begins in Step 7, as every success the attacker's player rolled is applied to his own soak. Any effects that would have taken place had the attack hit the Lunar affect the attacker. Also, the Lunar may use Charms or other supernatural powers to affect the damage as if she had started the attack (though they must be legally useable - either scene-long or in a Combo with Snake Body Technique).</description>

This Charm permanently enhances Snake Body Technique, allow-ing the Lunar to spend two extra motes to apply the Charm no matter how far the attacker is from her. The Charm becomes obvious when used in this way, as the character swings arrows around in the air and hurls them back with their original force or reflects elemental bolts back at their source.</description>

In a silver-and-rainbow flash, the aggressor disappears. The Lunar makes a standard close-range counterattack. If the attack succeeds, the aggressor is lost in the warp of the Wyld for ten ticks, reappearing in a place of the Lunar's choosing up to (Lunar's Essence) miles away. The Lunar may not relocate his opponent to an immediately hazardous location (so, no teleporting her into the air above a volcano).</description>

            <description>This strange Celestial martial art is one of the most widespread in Autochthonia. It is unusual when compared to Creation's fighting styles in that it revolves around the mastery of an advanced magitech weapon, the gyroscopic chakram, and responds poorly to attempts to practice it with less complex tools.
   Formulated over 3,000 years ago, Thousand Wounds Gear style explores the calculating certainty of law and artfully expresses the terrible agony that awaits transgressors. It is renowned for the horrific damage it inflicts, and its practitioners' aptitude for rendering targets helpless before calmly slicing them to pieces. In riot situations, the art is deployed as a tool of shock and awe. In the Reaches, it serves to cripple powerful gremlins as a prelude to their termination.
   Weapons and Armor: Attacks made with gyroscopic chakrams (see Chapter Six) are treated as unarmed for the purposes of this style's Charms, regardless of whether they are made at close or long range. Standard chakrams and wind-fire wheels may be substituted as alternative form weapons, but forcing the style to harmonize with these primitive tools imposes a one-mote surcharge on all of its Charms. Thousand Wounds Gear Style is fully compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>The Exalt moves with mechanical precision, interposing either a rigid grip or the saw-toothed edge of his weapon to catch an incoming strike. The martial artist's parry DV increases by two against an incoming attack, and if it succeeds in stopping the strike entirely, that attack's Speed retroactively increases by one (forcing the attacker's DV to refresh one tick later). If used barehanded, this Charm also allows the character to parry lethal and ranged attacks without a stunt.</description>

        <description>The martial artist assumes a posture of cold precision and industrial menace. Her every motion is carefully marshaled, wasting not even the slightest muscle twitch. All of her strength goes into her offense and defense, and nowhere else.
   The martial artist may treat her gyroscopic chakram as a target shield with no mobility penalty or fatigue value. Her barehanded strikes inflict lethal damage. Additionally, all of her unarmed attacks ignore Hardness.</description>

            <description>This strange Celestial martial art is one of the most widespread in Autochthonia. It is unusual when compared to Creation's fighting styles in that it revolves around the mastery of an advanced magitech weapon, the gyroscopic chakram, and responds poorly to attempts to practice it with less complex tools.
   Formulated over 3,000 years ago, Thousand Wounds Gear style explores the calculating certainty of law and artfully expresses the terrible agony that awaits transgressors. It is renowned for the horrific damage it inflicts, and its practitioners' aptitude for rendering targets helpless before calmly slicing them to pieces. In riot situations, the art is deployed as a tool of shock and awe. In the Reaches, it serves to cripple powerful gremlins as a prelude to their termination.
   Weapons and Armor: Attacks made with gyroscopic chakrams (see Chapter Six) are treated as unarmed for the purposes of this style's Charms, regardless of whether they are made at close or long range. Standard chakrams and wind-fire wheels may be substituted as alternative form weapons, but forcing the style to harmonize with these primitive tools imposes a one-mote surcharge on all of its Charms. Thousand Wounds Gear Style is fully compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>This Charm supplements the act of releasing an opponent from a clinch. The martial artist pivots out of the clinch, throwing his opponent over his shoulder on a high-angle trajectory. The target is hurled to any point in midair up to twice the usual throw distance, where she hangs suspended in defiance of gravity. She cannot move from that spot until the Charm ends unless she possesses a form of self-propelled aerial locomotion. She falls normally at the end of the dura-tion unless another effect keeps her in the air.</description>

        <description>The Alchemical banks her attacks, striking broadly to impart force as well as damage. This Charm supplements an unarmed attack against an opponent who is in midair. If it successfully strikes the target, the target remains suspended until the martial artist's next action as per the effects of Rearing Crane Release. If the target is an Essence user, he may cancel this effect and fall normally by reflexively spending five motes. Regardless of whether he pays this cost, he also suffers a -1 DV penalty until his next action.</description>

Great bladed gears erupt from her anima to momentarily solidify around an unarmed attack, radically boosting the trauma it inflicts on its unfortunate target. An unarmed attack enhanced by this Charm counts the martial artist's Strength twice for the purpose of calculating raw damage. Additionally, its minimum damage increases by one die.

        <description>An understanding of the methods by which force may be gathered and directed to one purpose informs this technique. The Exalt's anima streaks out from her arm in a jagged pulse, almost faster than the eye can see. The Charm enhances an unarmed attack. If it hits, the victim is hurled back a number of yards equal to (the martial artist's Strength x 5) and suffers automatic knockdown upon landing, with results identical to those detailed in Heaven Thunder Hammer (see Exalted, pp. 242-243) if an obstacle stops him prematurely.</description>

        <description>One of the most common mishaps in the industrial world of the Alchemical Exalted is accidental blinding by exposure to unbearably bright arcs of energy. The martial artist learns to mimic this tragedy in a more direct fashion, throwing a shower of white-hot sparks as a counterattack in response to any attack she defended against with an unarmed parry using a close combat weapon that does not inflict bashing damage. She may choose any target for the sparks within (Essence) yards and need not choose the attacker who prompted the Charm, resolving her counter-attack using the normal traits for the weapon with which she parried. If her counterattack would inflict any damage, her victim is instead blinded (as per Exalted, p. 152). The blistered eyes of the Exalted repair themselves after a full day, but mortal eyes boil away completely to leave behind smoking sockets.</description>

        <description>The frailty of human flesh is nothing set against the hungry teeth of the machine. The martial artist makes an unarmed attack using a weapon that doesn't inflict bashing damage. If the attack inflicts any levels of damage, it inflicts only one level but also imposes a Crippling wound. If the martial artist is attacking barehanded, this Crippling effect takes the form of shattered bones, disabling a limb. If using a gyroscopic chakram at close or long range, the effect takes the form of an amputated limb of the martial artist's choosing (see Exalted, p. 152, for sample amputation effects). Exalted victims heal disabled limbs when they heal the level of damage associated with them, while amputation requires more powerful treatment as normal.</description>

This art is a Celestial level martial arts style designed by the Third Circle demon Erembour (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V - The Roll of Glorious Divinity II, pp. 47-48). Its techniques specialize in diverting hostile energy into uncontrollable dissipation.
       Learning the Charms of this style requires the practitioner to have a minimum of Athletics 1, Performance 1, Stamina 2, Compassion 2 and Appearance 3.
   Form weapons for Swallowing Darkness Style include vaginas, penises, whips (including Erembour's tail or the equivalent), hair, teeth and claws. This style may not be practiced in armor or in clothes that eliminate access to the user's sexual organs.</description>

            <description>In the hands (or vagina) of the component souls of a fallen Primordial, the shadows of all things may readily be used to conquer them. This art is a Celestial level martial arts style designed by the Third Circle demon Erembour (see The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V - The Roll of Glorious Divinity II, pp. 47-48). Its techniques specialize in diverting hostile energy into uncontrollable dissipation.
       Learning the Charms of this style requires the practitioner to have a minimum of Athletics 1, Performance 1, Stamina 2, Compassion 2 and Appearance 3.
   Form weapons for Swallowing Darkness Style include vaginas, penises, whips (including Erembour's tail or the equivalent), hair, teeth and claws. This style may not be practiced in armor or in clothes that eliminate access to the user's sexual organs.</description>

        <description>Sex is more difficult to achieve if one's partner is clad in clothes or armor. This Charm costs one mote per point of mobility penalty or fatigue rating of a target's armor or clothing (with a minimum of one point). If the Charm user manages to control any clinch and activates this Charm, then the victim's clothes and armor are immediately spread in a random distribution across an area equal to the user's (Stamina + Performance) in yards.</description>

        <description>As the demonic lover assumes a wantonly alluring pose, she is sheathed in swirling veils of sensual shadow that accentuate her shape and promise to privately reward those who embrace her. For the remainder of the scene, she may reflexively spend one mote to gain a counterattack against any opponent who attacks her from melee range. Whether assaulted by a point blank archer seeking to penetrate her defenses or a muscular warrior swinging a large hammer, she responds with a clinch attempt. Clinches gained by way of this counterattack ignore penalties for flurries, coordinated attacks or multiple opponents, and the orgy of countermoves is limited only by the number of attacks her opponents launch and her own reserves of Essence.</description>
