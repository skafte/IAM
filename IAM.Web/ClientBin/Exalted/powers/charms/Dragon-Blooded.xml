        <description>The Dragon-Blooded can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability. The Charm adds two dice to the roll for each mote spent. The maximum number of dice that can be added to any one roll, however, is equal to the Dragon-Blood's Ability rating plus any applicable specialty. The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. The player rolls one die for every mote spent, up to a maximum number of dice equal to the relevant Ability plus any applicable specialties. Each success on the roll increases the applicable DV by one.
   Characters cannot use this or other Excellencies or dice-adding Charms to "create" actions. For example, if a character attacks on tick 3 and will attack again on tick 8, she cannot buy dice for an attack on tick 4 that only exists because she used the Excellency to conjure dice for it. Yet a character who uses this or other reflexive Charms to add to an attack can also use it to enhance her defense until the next tick when she acts, but she must spend Essence for each separate roll she wishes to modify.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. The Dragon-Blood, however, is limited in using the Charm as follows: The Charm can be used to add dice to any Ability on the tick in which the Dragon-Blood acts. On the ticks between actions, this Charm can only be used to enhance unrolled uses of the Ability to increase an applicable DV or to add dice to an Ability used in a Counterattack Charm. This Charm can not, for example, be used to purchase Melee dice between actions to be used for extra attacks.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood can invoke this Charm when making a roll based on the relevant Ability. The Exalt can spend up to (Ability + applicable specialties) in motes. The Charm adds one automatic success to the roll for every two motes spent. If the Dragon-Blood uses Essence Triumphant in combination with Charms that add dice, each success purchased with Essence Triumphant reduces by two the maximum number of dice that she can add.
   The Exalt can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. For every two motes spent, the Dragon-Blood can increase the applicable DV by one, up to a maximum improvement equal to her Ability trait plus any applicable specialties.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. The Dragon-Blood, however, is limited in using the Charm as follows: The Charm can be used to purchases automatic success on any action made on the tick in which the Dragon-Blood takes a normal action. On the ticks between actions, this Charm can be used only to enhance an unrolled use of the relevant Ability to improve a DV or to add dice to an Ability used in a Counterattack Charm. This Charm can not, for example, be used to purchase automatic successes between actions to be used for extra attacks.</description>

        <description>Dragon-Blooded with this Charm recovery smoothly from error. The Exalt can invoke this Charm after making a roll based on the relevant Ability. This Charm allows the player to make a second roll, using the new result if the Exalted prefers it to the first. The Exalted can also use this Charm to enhance unrolled uses of the relevant Ability. By spending three motes, the Dragon-Blooded can increase an applicable DV by half the relevant Ability.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo, but the Charm can be used only on the tick in which the Dragon-Blooded uses the Ability for which a reroll is being purchased.</description>

        <description>The two greatest strengths of the Dragon-Blooded have always been their superior numbers and their boundless capacity for teamwork. In the First Age, the Terrestrial Exalted were the unit commanders who led troops into battle under the direction of Celestial generals.In The Modern Era, Dragon-Blooded retain the capacity to elevate the mortals around them to greatness, if only temporarily. A Dragon-Blood with this Charm can improve the ratings of his allies in the relevant Ability for brief periods of time, effectively transferring the benefits of the First Excellency to another person for the duration of an entire scene. All allies to be affected must hold hands at the time of the Charm's activation.
   The Dragon-Blood must spend one mote for every ally to be augmented and one mote for every two dice that are added to each person's rating in the relevant Ability. The maximum number of allies who can have their Ability ratings boosted at one time is equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. The Charm has two limitations. First, no ally's Ability rating can be raised above the Ability rating of the Exalt who invokes this Charm. Second, no ally's Ability rating can be increased to more than twice its normal rating. Therefore, the ally must have at least one dot in the Ability for this Charm to affect him at all. The extra Ability dots apply for an entire scene for all purposes. If the augmented Ability affects one of the ally's DV ratings, the relevant DV should be recalculated for the duration of the scene. As is normal for dice-adding Charms, fractional motes left over by pool-size restrictions are lost.</description>

            <errText>No contact is required to target a fellow officer; Exalted fellow officers may have Abilities raised higher than twice their rating (but still no higher than the donor's rating). With Essence 4+, targeting an Exalted unit leader and committing additional motes equal to the unit's Magnitude simultaneously applies the Charm to every member of the unit. Only Exalted fellow officers ignore the twice rating cap for a unit blessing, but boosting rank and file can increase the unit’s Close Combat Rating or Ranged Combat Rating.</errText>

        <description>Like natural disasters incarnate, Dragon-Blooded explode with power and force. Upon activating the Charm, the Dragon-Blood chooses the First or Third Dragon-Blooded Excellency for the same Ability. The cost to activate the chosen Charm becomes zero motes until his DV refreshes, regardless of how much benefit he chooses to gain from it. This Charm costs six motes to activate, plus a number of Willpower points equal to the number of times the character has used any version of Surging (Ability) Mastery previously in the scene (maximum two Willpower points).</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can channel the power of his aligned element into a shaft and unleash it on a target. On a successful Archery attack, the Dragon-Blood may also inflict an elemental effect appropriate to his aspect on the target. Air buffets the target, subtracting two dice from his next action. Earth triggers a tremor beneath the target's feet, forcing his player to successfully roll (Dexterity + Athletics), difficulty 4, to keep him from falling. Fire sets the target ablaze for an action, inflicting four levels of lethal damage. Water fills the target's lungs with seawater, adding three ticks before his next action due to violent coughing. Wood increases the damage of the Dragon-Blood's arrow by +2L due the thorns covering it. The Essence for this Charm must be spent separately for each arrow fired. Although this Charm can be put into a Combo with an extra action Charm such as Swallows Defend the Nest, a particular target cannot be subjected to more than one particular elemental effect at a time. A Fire Aspect, for instance, could fire three separate arrows at three separate targets inflicting four additional levels of fire damage on each one. An Air Aspect and Earth Aspect could each shoot the same target and each inflict their respective penalties on that target, but a Fire Aspect could not hit the same target twice and inflict +8L fire damage.
   Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, this Charm is always considered a Wood-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies, and Dragon-Blooded can learn only the version associated with their aspects.</description>

        <description>The peerless archery of this Wood Aspect is such that she can shoot projectiles out of the air, including arrows fired at her. If the Dragon-Blood wishes to deflect an incoming missile with an arrow of her own, the player must roll (Dexterity + Archery) and compare the results to the attacker's roll. The attack is parried onlyif the player's roll equals or exceeds the attacker. A partial parry achieves nothing.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack, provided, of course, that the Dragon-Blood has her bow and arrows handy.</description>

        <description>Having mastered the art of protecting himself from ranged attacks by shooting projectiles out of the sky, the Dragon-Blood can now extend this protection to his allies. The Dragon-Blood must spend a base cost of three motes and one Willpower plus one mote per person to be protected, including himself. He must also have two arrows per person handy. His player then rolls (Dexterity + Archery). For every success rolled, the DV of every protected ally increases by one against ranged attacks. Once this Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood cannot take any other actions (such as combining his defense with another action as part of a flurry), nor can he undertake any non-Reflexive actions until his next regular action, or else, the Charm's effect ends immediately.</description>

        <description>The Charm Dragony Finds Mate permits the Dragon-Blood to knock the projectiles of his enemies from the sky with well-placed arrows. This Charm goes one better, as the Dragon-Blood's arrow goes on to strike the foolish one who dared to strike at a Prince of the Earth. As with Dragon y Finds Mate, the Exalt's player must roll (Dexterity + Archery). If the successes rolled by the player equal or exceed those of the attacker, the ranged attack is deflected. Furthermore, any successes in excess of those rolled for the attacker represent a reflexive archery attack made against that enemy. Also, the enemy's DV is not subtracted from this reflexive attack, unless the enemy has access to reflexive Charms that can be used to raise DV from zero or the enemy is already subject to a Charm with a persistent defense.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used on any tick. It is, however, an exception to the normal rules for Dragon-Blooded reflexive Charms. specifically, on any tick upon which the Dragon-Blood uses Sparrow Dives at Hawk, he cannot use any other Charms, including reflexive Charms, except for additional uses of Sparrow Dives at Hawk. Naturally, this limitation does not apply if the Charm is part of a Combo.</description>

            <errText>This Charm upgrades Dragonfly Finds Mate. If that Charm successfully parries an attack, the Exalt can pay an extra 4m, 1wp during Step 9 to launch an unblockable, undodgeable counterattack that applies a number of successes to hit equal to the (parry successes rolled - original attack successes) in place of an attack roll. The attack otherwise uses the statistics of the Terrestrial's weapon. Using Dragonfly Finds Mate this way follows standard Dragon-Blooded Reflexive Charm rules.</errText>

        <description>The Children of Sextes Jylis rarely want for anything in the forests they love, least of all ammunition. When the Dragon-Blood requires arrows, he can approach any plant, from a common oak tree to exotic plants such as desert cacti or marsh reeds. Then, once he spends the requisite Essence, the plant will instantly "sprout" into a number of arrows equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. The Dragon-Blood can summon any conventional type of arrow into existence, and the arrows are perfectly normal, if somewhat strange-looking. The arrows can be shared with any of the Dragon-Blood's fellow archers.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the archer and arrow truly become one, as the shaft can twist itself in flight to take a curved path toward its target, bypassing the enemy's cover. An attack accompanied by this Charm totally ignores all ranged cover modi ers granted by trees and wooden objects. Once charged with Essence, the arrow passes effortlessly through plants, trees, even wooden shields and timber forti cations, regardless of their thickness. It cannot penetrate objects containing or reinforced with the magical materials, though. Furthermore, if the arrow cannot go through cover, it can try to go around it. If the Dragon-Blood spends one Willpower in addition to the normal four motes of Essence, the arrow can alter its trajectory in midflight to curve around cover or find the tiniest eye slit in a reinforced bunker. The target's DV bonus acquired through being behind cover decreases by -1 per dot of the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. Only the DV bonus acquired from cover is affected this way, and regardless of the nature of the target's cover, it must be possible for an arrow to reach him by some trajectory. Arrows augmented by this Charm cannot be used to penetrate armor by "targeting its weak points".
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated only on a tick upon which the Dragon-Blood acts normally, however. It cannot be used on any tick falling between actions.</description>

            <errText>For its base cost, the Charm only negates wooden cover. Adding +1wp allows negation of any cover, provided some indirect path exists to hit the enemy. If this Charm enhances Elemental Bolt Attack (see Manual of Exalted Power: Dragon-Blooded, pp. 133-134) or another Charm that creates an attack out of raw elemental Essence, the Exalt may summon the destructive forces from an available source to strike indirectly (like calling down lightning strikes from the clouds).</errText>

        <description>Of all the Immaculate Dragons, none was as implacable a foe to the undead as Sextes Jylis, for it was his way as an embodiment of life itself to oppose the forces of death. When a Wood Aspect fires an arrow toward one of the undead and activates this Charm, the arrow sprouts leaves in midflight without affecting its trajectory. Upon striking an undead creature, it erupts into full bloom, ensnaring the foul thing in crushing vines. As a result of this magic, the arrow inflicts aggravated damage on its undead target instead of lethal. This Charm is equally as useful against materialized ghosts, nemissaries and hungry ghosts. It has no special effect against Abyssals, Deathlords or the living, however, though a successful hit still inflicts normal damage.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Wood Aspect can breathe new life into a wooden shaft, causing it to sprout writhing vines and hungry roots the instant it strikes its target. The arrow inflicts its normal damage, and if the archer's initial attack causes any damage to the target at all, the arrow sprouts roots and creepers that bore into the target's body. These tendrils inflict additional damage equal to the base damage type of the arrow (a minimum of 1L) on the tick upon which the arrow strikes. This additional damage ignores armor and may be soaked only with Stamina and other natural soak. The arrow inflicts this damage again five ticks later and again every five ticks thereafter until it is removed or until it inflicts the extra damage a total number of times equal to the archer's permanent Essence. The extra damage inflicted cannot be healed until the arrow is removed, which requires a (Dexterity + Medicine) roll with a difficulty equal to the permanent Essence of the archer.</description>

        <description>A Terrestrial with this Charm can apply Dragon-Blooded Archery Charms to enhance or provide ammunition for any non-magical Archery weapon she wields regardless of its scale (such as catapults, ballistae, etc.). Applying Dragon-Graced Arrow to a large projectile causes the elemental Essence to explode on impact, imposing its elemental power on all individuals and complementary units within a radius of (Essence x 5) yards as a one-time environmental hazard. Extra action Charms cost double the usual motes and an extra Willpower point to activate, and are automatically Obvious when used this way. Ravenous Thorn Technique costs 10m, 1wp to enhance artillery attacks; the boring missile inflicts its entire base damage at each interval and requires Craft (Earth) in place of Medicine to remove it.</description>

        <description>Most Archery Charms are incompatible with large artifact energy weapons. Not so for the Dragon-Blooded gunner who possesses this Charm. By touching an artifact with a rating no greater than the Exalt's Lore and activating this Charm (or laying hands on the hull of a vehicle equipped with such weapons), the Terrestrial's anima grows circuit-like patterns of vines that entwine and interface with the machinery as an obvious physical enhancement of the weapon. While active, all Dragon-Blooded Archery Charms are compatible with the artifact's attacks as if they were a personal-scale Archery weapon unless the Storyteller deems the Charm's effects inapplicable by function. Some effects might need slight modification for scale at Storyteller discretion, such as using Lore instead of Medicine to discharge the ongoing damage from Ravenous Thorn Technique. This Charm cannot enchant weapons that fire energies that are alien to Creation, such as pyre flame or Ligier's light.</description>

        <description>A Dragon-Blood with this Charm can move with the grace of a  ickering flame, using his speed and agility to  ank his opponent and gain the advantage in combat. Each mote spent (up to the maximum of the Exalt's permanent Essence) adds two dice of damage to a successful hand-to-hand attack. This damage is added before soak is applied. Normally, this Charm can be used only in hand-to-hand combat, but with a stunt, it may be applied to a Thrown or Archery attack. One can do so only if the target has no cover and has left himself open to a  anking maneuver, though. This Charm is explicitly allowed in Combos with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>For a scene, the Dragon-Blood can double his movement rate on all Move and Dash actions. While the Charm is in use, the Dragon-Blood leaves a trail of fiery footprints behind him, which have the potential to start fires if he runs through dry brush. This Charm does not affect the Speed of any of the Exalt's actions, just his movement rate. If the Exalt has an Athletics rating of 4, an Essence of 3 and the Terrestrial Athletics Reinforcement Charm, he can extend the effects of this Charm to others at a cost of two motes per person.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated only on a tick when the Dragon-Blooded initiates an action, though. It cannot be use on the ticks between actions.</description>

        <description>Fire is not restrained by gravity and can burn up walls as easily as across floors. Likewise, when she activates this Charm, a Child of Hesiesh can easily run up a tree or a wall as long as she can maintain a running pace and has at least two steps on the ground to establish her momentum. The Exalt cannot run upside down, and she dare not stop, lest she fall. The Exalt can run across water as easily as land, however, and she can even run across dangerous liquids such as lava or acid without sinking, although the soles of her feet will undoubtedly suffer injury.

        <description>The Fire Aspect's affinity for movement continues to improve. With this Charm, the Exalt is capable of defying gravity. He can rise up and, buoyed by a hot updraft, fly at a rate equal to twice his normal movement rate. During the duration of the flight, the  Dragon-Blood must remain within ([Essence + Athletics] x 3) yards of a solid surface. He can fly along the surface of walls and cliffs to gain a higher altitude, but the magic of the Charm will not function if he strays farther from a solid surface than the stated distance. Bodies of water are not a solid surface, and the Charm ends if the Exalt strays over large body of water, instantly dunking him. Also, the Dragon-Blood must remain in motion at all times. He cannot hover, and if he ever stops moving, the Charm ends. As the Exalt is dependent on warm air currents to remain in flight, his aerial maneuverability is relatively poor. He can engage in aerial combat or attack ground targets, but all actions suffer a -2 penalty while he is airborne.</description>

        <description>She who follows the Chosen of the Dragons sometimes feels the sparks of their Exalted might. This Charm may not be activated more times per scene than the Terrestrial's (Essence +1). While active, all Athletics Charms the character knows gain the Leader keyword unless the Storyteller deems that their effects solely relate to qualities a complementary unit lacks. In this moment of glory, a unit can achieve the impossible and do things like run up walls or even fly.
   Solar and Abyssal Exalted have counterpart Charms named Flying Faith Legion and Nowhere Is Safe, respectively. These Charms have a cost of three motes, duration of one scene, require Essence 4 and eschew the Purity keyword. The Solar version requires that every member of the unit have a positive Intimacy toward the leader, while its Mirror requires that all members be creatures of death.</description>

        <description>When the Elemental Dragons moved over the newly shaped Creation, their passage divided the gossamer motes of lingering chaos into their own aspects, carving Cytherea's malleable sea of the mind into Gaia's image. With this Charm active, the character's personal movement rate triples, and he suffers no height restriction while using Dancing Ember Stride. In conjunction with other Charms that increase movement speed, only the greatest benefit applies. The character may also trail a "fence" of elemental energy at will, which stands a number of yards high and wide equal to his Essence rating and lingers as long as the Charm remains active. Anyone attempting to pass through this barrier suffers a number of dice of lethal damage equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence, plus the various elemental effects imposed by Elemental Bolt Attack (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, pp. 133-134). Those who remain inside the fence suffer this harm each action. The barrier also provides 90% cover to those attacking through it and obliterates mundane projectiles up to arrow-size fired into it. Besides fencing enemies into a confined space, Terrestrials most commonly use the Charm to scribe aerial calligraphy for signaling across vast distances.</description>

        <description>The Earth whispers to its children and warns them of the foot-steps of those who approach with hostile intent. While the Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood cannot be surprised by any means. The Charm draws upon the intimate connection between the Earth Aspect and the ground beneath his feet, making them as one. Consequently, in order to use this Charm, the Exalt's feet must rest on the ground. "The ground" includes earth, grass or the lowest floor of a building, but if the Dragon-Blood is at sea, up in a tree, on an upper level of a building or simply resting with his feet propped up on a table, the Charm confers no benefits. The Dragon-Blood may extend this benefit to companions at a cost of two extra motes per person, affecting a maximum number of people equal to his Essence.</description>

As long as she is touching the ground (or in a building doing so), the Dragon-Blood can sense anything else resting on the ground in a radius of (Awareness x 25) feet.

        <description>To be aligned with Earth is to truly understand the concept of stasis, but such an understanding can overpower the minds of those not prepared for it. This Charm allows the Earth Aspect to infuse a person with the somnolent character of stone itself, thereby putting that person to sleep. The Exalt must somehow invoke the essential character of Earth prior to using this Charm, whether by capturing the subject's attention with a glittering jewel or simply speaking to him in a low droning voice. Regardless, the Exalt must somehow capture the subject's attention for at least five minutes, keeping him sitting still for this duration. The Dragon-Blood's player can then roll (Manipulation + Presence), with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Each success renders the target unconscious for one hour in a sleep so deep that nothing can rouse him. Once the magical duration has passed, the subject passes into normal slumber and can be awoken normally. While in the grip of this Charm, the sleeper will have strange dreams of underground caves and the mysteries within them. Often, the target of this Charm will awaken with insight on the location of a buried treasure or of where to dig a well that will never go dry.</description>

        <description>Using this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can ride the senses of another being. The subject must be within the Exalt's line-of-sight when the Charm is activated. Thereafter, the Exalt can see, hear, touch, smell and even taste whatever the subject experiences, provided that the subject remains within a number of miles equal to the Exalt's Essence. When the Charm is activated, the Terrestrial's player and that of the subject make opposed (Awareness + Essence) rolls. The Exalt's player must get at least one net success to enact the link. If the two tie, there is no effect. If the Exalt loses and the intended subject is also an Exalt, the subject's player gets a reflexive Awareness roll at difficulty 3 for the subject to know that someone was attempting to ride his senses. Mortal characters have no chance of knowing what the Exalt attempted.
   The Terrestrial must maintain concentration for the duration of the Charm, and even riding on a slow-moving horse or sitting in a sedan chair can cause her to miss important details. Any actions more complicated than that are completely impossible. Furthermore, the Exalt is at a -3 penalty to remain aware of events happening around her own person. The Dragon-Blood cannot use any Charms or spells "through" the person she is riding, nor can she understand any languages she doesn't know even if the subject does know them. The Exalt can, however, gain the benefits of any supernatural improvements the subject makes to his own Awareness.</description>

        <description>Having mastered the capability of riding another's senses, the Earth Aspect can now close off those senses, denying his subject their use. The target must be within direct line of sight. The Dragon-Blood's player rolls (Awareness + Essence), with a difficulty equal to the target's Perception. Each net success subtracts one die from the target's Awareness rolls pertaining to a single sense, and if the net successes exceed the target's Perception, the sense affected is totally shut down for the duration of this Charm. The Charm must be applied separately for each of the five senses. The Charm lasts for one action for every dot of permanent Essence the Dragon-Blood has. While this Charm is most commonly used to disable an enemy by taking away their sight, neutralizing a target's sense of touch also allows him to ignore wound penalties (one level of wound penalties per success or all wound penalties if the successes exceed the target's Perception). Thus, Dragon-Blooded of cers sometimes neutralize their subordinates' capacity to feel pain before sending them into battle. An Exalt cannot use this Charm on himself.</description>

        <description>The ultimate form of Awareness is the ability to perceive Essence, and the ultimate form of Awareness manipulation is perhaps this Charm, which allows the Dragon-Blood to suppress her target's ability to perceive and manipulate the Essence around him. The Dragon-Blood must pay a minimum of three motes and one Willpower, and she can spend an additional number of motes up to her permanent Essence. The Dragon-Blood's player must then roll (Awareness + Essence) with a difficulty of 3 for the character to analyze the patterns of Essence that surround the intended target. The target must be in sight and no farther away from her than a number of feet equal to her (permanent Essence x 10). If the initial roll succeeds, the player can then roll (Willpower + Essence) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Each net success on this roll increases the cost of all Charms and spells used by the target by one mote plus one additional mote for each extra mote of Essence the user spent activating the Charm. This surcharge is applied to every application of a Charm made by the target for a number of ticks equal to the Dragon-Blood's (Essence x 5). If the target uses a reflexive defensive Charm multiple times in a single action, he must pay the surcharge for each use. If he uses a Combo, he must pay the surcharge on each individual Charm that makes up the Combo.</description>

        <description>In contact with the ground, the Exalt feels for hostile vibrations of sound and Essence. This Charm improves its prerequisite, allowing it to scan out to (Essence rating) miles. When using this extended range, however, it detects only the Magnitude rating, location and vector of ground-based military units with Magnitude 3+, as well as ground-based vehicles transporting such units. This understanding is conveyed without need for a roll, but if any Charm conceals a unit from detection in the slightest, even an Excellency, resolve detection using standard roll-off rules. The Charm has no way to differentiate friend from foe, but it identifies military units without noticing non-violent crowds.
       Provided the Exalt is able to use it, Feeling the Dragon's Bones self-activates to detect units whenever a valid unit in range fully resolves an attack the Terrestrial can't otherwise perceive. Because the attack must resolve, this does not help avoid ambushes. The Exalt may reflexively suppress this warning intuition for a scene to conserve motes.</description>

        <description>Those capable of sensing Essence respire motes from the component dragons and breath of Gaia. By means of this Charm, the life of the world takes back what is hers. The Dragon-Blood designates a single animate target within (Essence x 10) yards as a Shaping effect. If that being has Essence 1, then its life force or animating energy drains into the earth, killing the target instantly and painlessly with any soul falling into Lethe. Beings with Essence 2+ fare better, losing one Willpower point from metaphysical shock and a number of motes equal to the Dragon-Blood's (Essence x 5) that visibly discharge into the nearest surface of the earth. Thereafter, until the end of the scene, any Exalt who uses the Charm Feeling the Dragon's Bones (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, pp. 140-141) within a mile of the discharged Essence feels the energy and may draw any number of these motes into herself as part of activating that Charm. The Martyr effect requires the Exalt to target himself, in which case all Essence users without an elemental aspect within (Essence x 10) yards suffer the Charm's normal drain effect. The Exalt's Essence condenses into a demesne sharing his aspect with a level equal to his Breeding.</description>

By spending a single mote of Essence, the Dragon-Blood can divide his own Bureaucracy Ability dots among a group of underlings who have no Bureaucracy Ability dots with which to begin. The Dragon-Blood cannot give out more dice than he has, nor can he give any underling more than a single dot. The Dragon-Blood must supervise the work of the affected underlings, and while his Bureaucracy dots are farmed out, he is considered to have no actual Bureaucracy dots of his own.</description>

        <description>To the Children of Daana'd, all bureaucracies are the same, differing only in surface details that result from the personalities of differing managers and staff. Once the Dragon-Blood grasps the essential character of the bureaucratic milieu, she can insinuate herself into almost any specific bureaucratic setting with ease. By activating this Charm, the Exalt may instantly understand the inner workings of the bureaucracy with which she is confronted, knowing such details as who is in charge of specific tasks and where equipment (including secret information) is kept. She may also substitute her Bureaucracy for her Socialize Ability for bureaucracy-related purposes. The Charm does not go so far as to grant unfettered ac-cess to locked or guarded areas, but it may aid the Exalt in finding someone else capable of securing such access.</description>

The Charm does not reveal any secrets that a rank-and-file member of the organization could not learn with successful mundane inquiry, so insinuating into the All-Seeing Eye does not reveal the identities of secret operatives.</errText>

        <description>While more martially inclined Dragon-Blooded look down on their kin in the bureaucracies and business centers, other Exalts understand that the business world can be as much a battlefield as any military setting. In such an environment, what matters is simply getting the job done. With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can articulate a single task: tax collection, troop recruitment, merchandising transactions or almost anything else that can be accomplished in a bureaucratic setting. The task must be one that is bureaucratic in nature, however, and within the normal purview of the bureaucracy to be affected. That is, the Exalt could declare as a task "acquire for me 2,000 straight swords" but not "construct for me 2,000 straight swords", as the latter instruction requires craftsmanship rather than bureaucratic acumen. Likewise, the Exalt could not order a tax-collection agency to engage in troop recruitment or to direct a mercenary company to completely reorganize a public library (at least, not without a fairly remarkable stunt).
   For the duration of the task, the Dragon-Blood's agents and assistants work with exceptional skill and dedication. The Exalt's player rolls (Charisma + Bureaucracy), adding his character's Essence in automatic successes. The Dragon-Blood must then assign the task to one or more mortal individuals who are in some way subservient to him (employees, military subordinates, junior clerks, etc.). Each mortal who is present when the task is assigned and whose highest MDV is less than the successes achieved on the dice roll instantly gains a loyalty toward quickly and efficiently completing the named task. Also, any affected mortal may add the Dragon-Blood's Essence to her MDV when resisting either natural or unnatural attempts to divert her from working to fulfill the task. Furthermore, the loyalty is contagious in nature. Even a mortal who is not present when the Dragon-Blood activates this Charm will gain both a loyalty toward completing the task and the MDV Essence bonus if he is assigned to work on it by a superior and his MDV is less than the Dragon-Blood's successes. The Charm's effects last until the task is complete or until three months have past, whichever comes first.
   The Charm can affect a given mortal only once for a single task, and if her MDV exceeds the Dragon-Blood's successes, she will be under no particular obligation to complete the task, nor will she gain any particular immunity against attempts to dissuade her. This does not mean that she cannot work freely on the task, which might be a normal part of her job, but she is not compelled to do so. On the other hand, if a mortal's MDV does not exceed the Dragon-Blood's successes, the mortal can resist only by spending a number of Willpower points equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence. Mortals who are not affected by the Charm do not act as vectors for transmission of the contagious loyalty, but those who are can "infect" new employees throughout the duration of the Charm. Exalted and spirits are utterly immune to the effects of Geese-Flying-South Administration, as are mortals who are not part of the affected bureaucracy.
   In addition to providing tangible protection for workers against sabotage by the Exalt's enemies, this Charm can also be used in the context of long social actions. By simply declaring the use of this Charm, the Dragon-Blood will find at the conclusion of the task that the results are even better than he could have hoped. Monetary pro ts from the venture increase by an additional one percent per success on an (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) roll. The exchange of commodities results in an additional two percent more goods acquired per success on the roll. Conscription and other recruitment measures are likewise improved by two percent per success on a (Charisma + Bureaucracy) roll. Alternatively, instead of improving the success of the task, the Dragon-Blooded can choose to reduce the time it takes to complete the task. In such a case, each success on the relevant Bureaucracy roll reduces by five percent the amount of time it will take to complete a long-term bureaucratic endeavor. The Storyteller must determine the base result of any such endeavor before the improvements granted by the Charm are added. This Charm does not confer any long-term benefits on the efficiency of the bureaucracy in general. It simply makes sure that the bureaucracy will perform this single task with aplomb.</description>

        <description>The Terrestrial Reinforcement Charm for Bureaucracy permits a Dragon-Blood to supernaturally augment the Bureaucracy skills of trusted retainers. Ultimately, however, the Dragon-Blood must trust to the personal judgment of such retainers in doing their jobs unless she micro-manages their work, a task beneath the dignity of busy Exalt. With this Charm, the Exalt can designate a single trusted mortal to serve as her proxy in business matters. For the duration of the Charm, the proxy will have the Dragon-Blood's Bureaucracy Ability rating, and the cost of the Charm is one mote plus one for every dot that the proxy's rating is improved. This Essence is com-mitted for the duration of the Charm, which is equal to one week per success achieved by the Dragon-Blood's player on a (Perception + Bureaucracy) roll. The Exalt can terminate the Charm at any time, but the Essence spent is committed until the Charm ends. This Charm is completely ineffective on supernatural beings.
   In addition to an improved Bureaucracy rating, the proxy automatically develops a Motivation to faithfully serve the Dragon-Blood for the duration of the Charm. This new Motivation completely supplants any prior Motivation possessed by the proxy as long as the Charm lasts. Most importantly, the proxy need not guess how best to serve the Dragon-Blood's interests, as he knows intuitively exactly what the Dragon-Blood would do if she were in his place.The Charm confers one  nal benefit that is seldom discussed among the Dragon-Blooded, as its application is considered an affront to the Immaculate Philosophy. If the Dragon-Blood dies while this Charm is still in effect, the Dragon-Blood may transfer the remains of her consciousness to the proxy, seizing total control of his mind and body. (Doing so requires a successful reflexive Willpower roll). She retains all of her memories and her normal Bureaucracy rating but none of her prior supernatural abilities. She can remain "alive" in the proxy's body until the Charm would normally end, at which time her soul moves on to enter the cycle of reincarnation and the proxy is left a mindless, soulless husk, as if he had been a victim of the Fair Folk. Although this aspect of the Charm can allow a Dragon-Blood to fulfill some  nal task (often including avenging her own death), the Immaculate Order considers it a blasphemous and arrogant attempt to delay one's reincarnation. Therefore, surviving proxies are often preemptively executed by the Dragon-Blood's family as a precautionary measure before any scandal might attach.</description>

Transferring the Exalt's soul in the moment of death is an irresistible total control effect; the deceased uses the host's Physical Attributes and Appearance, but otherwise has her own non-magical traits while possessing her subordinate. The Willpower rating of a spent vessel drops to 0. Dragon-Blooded descendants are also viable targets of this Charm, but can't be possessed.</errText>

        <description>As the Immaculate Texts say: "That which can be facilitated can also be impeded". This is as true for bureaucracies as anything else to which a Dragon-Blood applies himself. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood may bring any bureaucratic or administrative tasks going on within the sound of his voice to a standstill. The player of anyone attempting to succeed on a Bureaucracy action must overcome the Dragon-Blood's player in an opposed (Stamina + Bureaucracy) roll. While this Charm might be freely used in business-related settings or even against lesser agents of the ministries, it is a serious crime to attempt to delay the business of the Delibera-tive with this Charm.</description>

These rules entirely replace the listed rules for the Charm. Only the highest penalty among all uses of this Charm applies to any action.</errText>

To the Terrestrial Exalt, such knowledge is as plain as the nose on each voter's face. With but a single glance around the room, a Dragon-Blood who exercises this Charm can instantly know what the outcome would be if the issue currently under discussion were brought to a vote. The Exalt cannot perceive who exactly will vote for or against the proposition, but he can instantly tell how many yeas, nays and abstentions would be recorded if the question were called. This Charm works only on groups of seven or more. Also, since a person using this Charm is most likely still considering his vote, both the Dragon-Blood and anyone else using this Charm register as an "abstention" on the vote tally.</description>

            <errText>Voters with a dodge MDV greater than the Exalt's (Perception + Bureaucracy) count as abstentions. The Charm also can't analyze potential voters whom the Exalt can't perceive, such as those who are not present for the meeting. Because the Charm extracts the information from the minds of others rather than divining the future, it can predict the votes of beings outside fate.</errText>

        <description>Sometimes, even the Princes of the Earth are forced to haggle over the sale or purchase of goods or over the fine details of a contract. On such occasions, this Charm is invaluable, as it lets the Exalt peer deep into the heart of the person with whom she is bargaining to determine how much the person is willing to pay or what he is willing to concede to allow the deal to be made. The Exalt's player must roll (Wits + Bureaucracy). With one success, the character knows whether the current offer on the table is half or more of the target's minimum or maximum offer. With two successes, the Exalt can identify the other party's limit within 10 percent. Three or more successes allow the Exalt to know exactly how much the other party is willing to pay or what is the lowest sum he will accept.</description>

        <description>As a highly honor-bound and legalistic society, the Dragon-Blooded have developed elaborate customs and rituals concerning the exchanges of gifts. An appropriate present for a host can smooth one's way out of a difficult social blunder, while an auspicious gift to someone in dire straits might well obligate him to aid the gift-giver later, whether he wishes to or not. With a successful (Perception + Bureaucracy) roll made by her player, the Dragon-Blood can intuit what the perfect gift would be or the perfect bribe. The Charm does not provide the gift, or even easy access to it, but knowledge of what sort of gift would secure a favorable response. If the Dragon-Blood knows the recipient reasonably well, the difficulty is only 1. If the Dragon-Blood knows the recipient only by reputation, the difficulty is 2. Identifying the perfect bribe for an anonymous of cial or a beautiful stranger across a banquet hall is difficulty 3. While monetary gifts might be sufficient for almost all mortals, the Dragon-Blooded have rari ed tastes, to say nothing of beings such as spirits, demons or Celestial Exalts. Such beings will often require unusual items such as the first-born son of a hated rival or a ball gown designed by a renowned dress designer who resides some 2,000 miles distant.</description>

Also, the Charm exerts no Servitude when targeting a character with an Essence rating more than one dot higher than the Terrestrial unless the target is the character’s sibling, parent or child. The Exalt may know what gifts are best for her elders, but this does not place them in her debt when she shows due reverence and gratitude for their daily beneficence.</errText>

        <description>Anyone who is not proficient at the arts of the deal is wise to be suspicious of any contract he does not fully understand. But even the craftiest of traders should be suspicious of contracts with the Dragon-Blooded, some of whom can draft fine print capable of ensnaring the most sophisticated Guild operative as if he were a country bumpkin. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can conceal penalty clauses, conditions, extra fees and almost any other sort of fine print into a contract without the other party noticing their presence until after he signs it. The added contract clauses must be reasonably subtle, which may call for Storyteller discretion. A clause stating that interest on a loan balloons to 50 percent compounded weekly if the other party is late on a single payment or that the other party's business is forfeit if he fails to complete a task within a certain deadline is permissible. A clause stating that the other party will sell himself into slavery for a nominal fee or that he agrees to buy a horse without noticing that it only has three legs is not permissible. Also, contract clauses that the Dragon-Blood knows to be impossible to fulfill automatically fail. The Dragon-Blood must define the clause when drafting the contract, and a contract can contain only one clause obfuscated by this Charm. When the other party reviews the contract, his player must successfully roll (Wits + Bureaucracy) roll against a difficulty equal to the Dragon-Blood's (Bureaucracy + Essence) in order to notice the clause or to grasp its import. This Charm automatically fails to conceal the fine print when the contract is reviewed by a party with a higher Essence than the Dragon-Blood or a party using Celestial-level Bureaucracy Charms. Such beings might still agree to the terms anyway, however, particularly if the other party desperately needs whatever the Dragon-Blood has to offer.</description>

        <description>This Charm is not remotely as powerful as the oath-swearing powers of the Eclipse and Moonshadow Castes. Nevertheless, it is a potent aid in enforcing even the most odious of contract terms, even when the other party is determined to breach the contract outright rather than comply. The Dragon-Blood must draft a written contract and then charge it with Essence. When the contract is signed, all parties are bound to comply with its terms on their face. Deliberate breach of any of the contract's terms inflicts one point of unsoakable lethal damage on the breaching party for each point of Essence possessed by the Dragon-Blood using this Charm. An accidental breach will not inflict any damage unless the breaching party refuses to cure the breach within a reasonable period of time. The damage is inflicted on any breaching party only one time, even if the contract creates a continuing duty to perform. Also, all parties are subject to this penalty, including the Dragon-Blood who drafted the contract. A contract can be subject to both this Charm and Distraction of the Babbling Brook, either employed by the same Dragon-Blood or two different ones. Each Charm can be incorporated into a particular contract only once, however. Not even the Dragon-Blooded can negate a contract unilaterally once it is signed, but any contract can be voided if all parties verbally agree to it.</description>

            <errText>A contract is not binding unless the signatories do so of their own free will (i.e. not compelled by unnatural influence). Less invasive coercion such as threats don't void a signature. It is not required for all signatories to benefit from the contract. The penalty for deliberate breach of contract is (Exalt's Essence rating at the time of activation)L unsoakable damage. A signatory has a number of days equal to her Essence rating to fix an accidental breach to avoid this damage, but the countdown only starts upon becoming aware of the error. Essence 4+ makes this Charm holy, inflicting aggravated damage to creatures of darkness.</errText>

        <description>Although it is not the place of the Terrestrial Exalted to rule Creation, their honorable example can have a profound positive effect on others, inspiring shame in those who fail to live up to the standard. The Exalt may target an individual or social unit with Essence or Magnitude (respectively) no greater than his Bureaucracy, provided he addresses the in-dividual or belongs to the unit and is not its leader. While this Charm remains active, every social attack against the target that is intended to make it follow its Motivation or official Policy (rather than its current course of action) is considered unnatural mental influence, halving the target's MDV. The Martyr effect of this Charm requires public suicide in the target's presence, but increases the maximum target Essence/Magnitude to the Terrestrial's (Bureaucracy + Essence) and the effect lasts until the target changes its Motivation/Policy.</description>

        <description>The skill of a Prince of the Earth is so great that she doesn't even need tools to do her work. The Dragon-Blood can enchant one of her hands so that it will perform the functions of a tool - a pick axe, a hatchet, a hammer, etc. - while still functioning normally as a hand. The hand does not alter its appearance. Instead, invisible Essence flows around the hand to solidify in the shape of the desired tool according to the Dragon-Blood's will, dissipating into nothingness whenever she wants to use her hand for any normal purpose. The Charm must be used twice to affect both hands, and if the Exalt wishes to change tools, she must use the Charm again.
   The Charm can be used to transform the Dragon-Blood's hand into a deadly weapon such as a hammer or a pickaxe, adding a maximum of +2 bashing or +1 lethal to her unarmed attacks, depending on whether the tool is bladed or not.</description>

        <description>Artisans often say that the essence of sculpture is to observe the rock that one wishes to carve and the simply slice away those portions that are not part of the desired end. This Charm brings truth to that aphorism, allowing the Dragon-Blood to engage in astonishing feats of stonecraft. The character must spend at least one minute carefully striking at a quantity of stone. Characters most typically use a tool of some sort, but a sword pommel or a rock will do, as will bare hands if the character has Martial Arts 2 or better. At the end of one minute, the character strikes the  nal blow, and the rock shatters, leaving behind whatever form the Dragon-Blooded wished to fashion.
   The Exalt's player must roll (Wits + Craft). With one success, the character can blast an opening in a stone wall or quarry stone blocks ready for use in construction. With three successes, she can fashion a simple work of art or functional pottery (such as a jug already hollowed out for use) from living rock. With five successes, she can create artwork of astonishing beauty and complexity, including still-life sculpture so realistic that, on close examination, one can see pores and individual hairs. The Essence cost of this Charm is determined by the size of the volume manipulated: 1 mote per cubic foot of stone.</description>

With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood becomes a flawless mountaineer and rock-climber. The Dragon-Blood's fingers pass easily into any rock face, leaving behind indentations that he and others can use as handholds. The Dragon-Blood himself can hang from any stone or earthen surface without a roll unless it is worse than sheer (such as an overhang or a cavern roof). Even then, he or anyone following him gains two automatic successes on an Athletics roll to crawl along such surfaces. The Dragon-Blood can move across such surfaces at a rate of 10 feet per action or twice that if the surface is already suitably rough enough for mountain climbing (or if someone has already used this Charm to make it so).</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood may attempt to find the weak spot in some object. If the Dragon-Blood wishes to eliminate the flaws in an object, his player must roll (Intelligence + Craft) and spend one Willpower point. With a single success, damaged items are repaired instantly, although some things might be so damaged that this Charm must be used multiple times. If the Dragon-Blood wishes to strike at the item's weak point, any damage inflicted on his next successful physical attack against the object is doubled. If used against armor or a weapon, treat this as a disarming attempt, with a success destroying the item.
   Using this Charm requires the Dragon-Blood to spend at least one minute examining the item to be affected. It costs one mote if he can physically touch or handle the item or three motes if he must study it from a distance. This Charm is explicitly allowed to be made a part of a Combo with other Abilities.</description>

            <errText>The activation roll uses the character's highest Craft ability. Fixing objects is a Shaping effect, and the Charm can only repair non-magical inanimate objects by default. Broken structures must be repaired by mending each component object. Repairing a damaged simple artifact requires Essence 3+ and each use counts as (Essence rating) successes toward the task. Repairing or maintaining magitech or other exotic craft products further requires at least a dot of the appropriate Craft. If a special character uses this Charm to study flaws, she can communicate her findings to her leader or a fellow officer to enhance the next attack against the target made by the unit or character, respectively. If a character or unit has multiple applications of this Charm advising it on how to destroy an object, the formula for damage increase is (raw damage x 2) + (total Essence of advisors past first).</errText>

        <description>The Charm of Lesser Unmaking permits the Dragon-Blood to reduce any crafted item to its component parts, all arranged neatly in a pile as if ready for initial construction. Used on a heavy wooden door bound in steel bands, the result would be a stack of precut timbers, some hammered steel bands and a small pile of rivets and nails. Ropes bound in the tightest of knots are rearranged into neat coils, and a sword blade is separated from its hilt, guard and pommel. However, items that consist of a single component, such as a cup, are unaffected. Enchanted items arefineutralized while their component parts are separated, but the enchantments themselves remain intact, and if the item is reassembled, the magic is restored.
   The player of the character using this Charm must roll (Craft + Essence). The difficulty is 1 for simple items (crude stone hatchets, huts lashed together with vines), 3 for sturdily or competently made items (a well-made sword, chain links, a banded door) or 5 for intricate or masterfully created items (finely crafted jewelry, clockwork mechanisms, artifacts). If the object is enchanted or has an Artifact rating of 1, the difficulty increases by one, meaning that most enchanted items are difficulty 6 to disassemble. Artifacts with a rating of 2 increase the difficulty by two, and this Charm cannot be used to unmake an artifact with a rating of 3 or higher, nor can it be used against any artifacts made entirely of the magical materials, such as most weapons or armor. The maximum volume that can be affected with this Charm is equal to the Exalt's Essence in cubic yards. Using this Charm requires the Exalt to handle or remain in contact with the item for a number of actions equal to the difficulty of the roll. This Charm cannot be used as part of a combat maneuver.</description>

        <description>This Charm functions in a manner similar to the Charm of Lesser Unmaking, but its effects are more dramatic. Instead of simply disassembling an item into its component parts, items affected are reduced into their original raw materials. A heavy wooden door bound in steel bands will be reduced to a pile of uncut logs and hunks of raw iron. Fine jewelry is reduced to uncut gems and unprocessed gold ore. Fine pottery melts into clay.
   The Exalt's player must roll (Craft + Essence). The difficulty is 1 for most items, 3 for exceptionally crafted or constructed things and 5 for artifacts, including anything forged from the magical materials. The Exalt cannot, however, disassemble an artifact with a rating above that of her Essence. The Exalt must remain in contact with the item for a number of actions equal to the difficulty, and the maximum size of material that can be affected is a number of cubic yards equal to the Exalt's Essence.</description>

        <description>By grabbing hold of a hearthstone and squeezing, an Exalt using this Charm may shatter its crystallized energies and conduct the Essence surge back into the world through himself. In addition to destroying the gem with a deafening thunderclap and a flash brighter than the noonday sun, the Charm restores a number of motes equal to (the stone's rating x 5) to the Terrestrial's Essence pool and causes his anima to explode to the 16+ mote level. Breaking the hearthstone thus doesn't harm the stone's manse, which grows a replacement in days equal to its rating. It is possible to attack hearthstones that are externally socketed in an enemy's artifacts, but the Exalt must first win control of a grapple and activate this Charm (which gently releases the opponent).
   With Essence 6+, a Dragon-Blood may use this Charm to attack any targeted hearthstone within (Essence x 10) yards by squeezing his fist and making an unblockable attack with an accuracy pool of Wits + Craft (Air or Earth). If the attack succeeds, the stone shatters, and its energies arc to the Terrestrial's hand.</description>

        <description>It stands to reason that, if one wishes to dodge, one must have room to do so. The Dragon-Blooded defy this obvious logic. For the duration of a single tick, a Dragon-Blood using this Charm can ignore all environmental penalties to his Dodge DV, even in places where dodging would seemingly be impossible, such as on tree limbs or up to his knees in quicksand.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack.</description>

        <description>When this Charm is activated, the Dragon-Blood's ability to avoid danger becomes truly astonishing. When the Dragon-Blood is attacked and successfully evades injury through his Dodge DV, he can reflexively spend two motes to let his dodge carry him on and away from his attacker. The Dragon-Blood can instantly and reflexively execute a Dash action without suffering any DV penalty for doing so. Doing so usually takes him out of hand-to-hand combat range and allows him to evade most multiple attack Charms after the first attack. This Charm must be activated as part of a dodge, however, so if the Dragon-Blood relies on his Parry DV instead of his Dodge DV, the Charm cannot be used.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack.</description>

        <description>If an ally within normal leaping distance (about five yards) is subject to an attack, the Dragon-Blood using this Charm can attempt to move her out of the way. The Exalt's player must first roll (Dexterity + Dodge + Essence). If the player gets no successes, the attack proceeds normally. If the player gets any successes, the character can make himself the target of the attack instead of the ally. If his successes exceed the successes on the attack roll, both the Dragon-Blooded and the ally automatically dodge without a roll. Otherwise, the attacker's remaining successes are applied as damage against the Dragon-Blood (with soak applied normally).

            <errText>This Charm cannot protect against undodgeable attacks or attacks targeting characters more than (Dodge + Essence) yards away. If the attack is redirected, the target perfectly dodges it and the attack resolves normally against the Exalt. If the activation roll isn’t sufficient to perfectly dodge the attack, the Terrestrial may apply his Dodge DV or Parry DV as normal. The possibility for failure in this Charm constitutes its Flaw of Invulnerability. When used in mass combat, this Charm ignores usual range limits to allow a special character to protect any fellow officer in his unit (champions can only be protected from attacks by non-champions).</errText>

        <description>In close-quarters combat, a reckless opponent is sometimes as likely to hit an ally as the intended target. With this Charm, the Exalt can make this likelihood into a certainty. If a Dragon-Blood who is the target of an attack has a Dodge DV of at least half the attacker's dice pool (whether naturally or with the application of Charms), he can reflexively spend three motes to make the attack automatically miss him and instead strike another person. The new target is then affected by the attack as if he had been the original target all along (i.e., the new target's DV is subtracted from the attacker's dice pool). The new target must be within three yards of the Dragon-Blood, and the attacker cannot be made to attack himself. This Charm cannot be used if the Dragon-Blood has no viable alternative target.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack.</description>

        <description>This Charm creates a glowing aura of elemental energy that radiates for a few feet around the Exalt who activates it and helps protect her from harm. The elemental energy created is determined by the aspect of the Dragon-Blood. Regardless of its nature, however, Elemental Defense Technique provides the following benefits. First, any Archery attacks are totally negated, as any incoming arrows are torn apart by the surging elemental force. Second, anyone attempting to make an unarmed attack against the Exalt suffers four levels of bashing damage, soaked normally. Third, the Exalt gains +2 to her lethal and bashing soaks against attacks with any weapon not made of the magical materials.
   Finally, each elemental aura grants an additional benefit. Air buffets any close-range attackers, giving the Exalt a +2 to her Dodge DV against hand-to-hand attacks. Earth surrounds the Dragon-Blood with a thick cloud of dust, which gives her +2 to her Dodge DV against ranged attacks. Fire inflicts two levels of lethal damage on any hand-to-hand attackers instead of the normal bashing damage. Water totally neutralizes any fire-based attacks directed against the Dragon-Blood and also cushions her against attacks, adding an additional +1 to lethal and bashing soak. Wood surrounds the Dragon-Blood with a thick cloud of pollen and other irritants, and hand-to-hand attackers who fail a (Stamina + Resistance) roll suffer a -1 penalty for the rest of the scene. A Dragon-Blood of the same aspect as the one who invokes this Charm is immune to these aspect-related effects, as is any Dragon-Blooded whose anima banner is at the 8+ motes level.
   Unlike many elemental Charms, a Dragon-Blood can learn more than one version of Elemental Defense Technique, but she must learn the version associated with her aspect first. Only one version can be maintained at a time, and the activation of a different version cancels out the prior one. Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be a Fire-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies.</description>

            <errText>By default, the Charm obliterates non-magical projectiles that are personal scale, whether arrows or thrown weapons.

References to DV bonuses are separate external penalties applied against attacks. The Charm does not damage attackers directly, but instead projects an enspevironmental hazard in a one yard radius around the Terrestrial with Damage: 4B/action (2L/action for the fire version) and Trauma (Exalt’s Essence rating).</errText>

        <description>The Fire Aspect's remarkable skill at dodging attacks approaches its pinnacle, allowing him to dodge an attack and instantly initiate a free counterattack. Whenever the Dragon-Blood relies on his Dodge DV and the attacker fails to hit him, the Dragon-Blood can spend the Essence and make a reflexive Martial Arts or Melee counterattack with his full dice pool. This Charm cannot be used to respond to a counterattack launched with any Charm nor can it be combined with any other Charm that allows the Dragon-Blood a free counterattack.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack.</description>

        <description>The most potent of the Dodge Charms in the Dragon-Blooded arsenal, this Charm is actually a cluster of five elemental Charms. This Charm represents the closest a Dragon-Blood can come to the perfect dodges practiced by the Celestial Exalted. When the Charm is activated, the Dragon-Blood's entire body and everything on it transforms for an instant into the element to which she is aligned, shaped by magic into a human form. Whether the Exalt's body is composed of mist, dust, fire, water or swirling leaves, the attack passes harmlessly through her.
   The Charm functions as a perfect dodge subject to two limitations. First, the attack must be dodgeable, as this defense will not apply to attacks that cannot be dodged. Second, each of the five Unassailable Body of (Element) Defenses is vulnerable to a particular type of weapon or attack or else suffers from a situation in which it will not apply. Air is vulnerable to Earth-aspected elemental attacks and to extremely large melee weapons that carry the Overwhelming tag, as the strong breeze caused by the passage of such weapons disrupts the Body of Air. Earth is vulnerable to attacks with wooden weapons such as arrows or clubs and to Wood-aspected elemental attacks, as even the toughest earth must yield to the burrowing roots of trees. Fire is vulnerable to Water-aspected elemental attacks, and also will not function while the Dragon-Blood is in the water or is otherwise wet. Water is vulnerable to Air-aspected elemental attacks and also will not function in conditions of extreme cold, as water inevitably loses its  uidity in such situations. Wood is vulnerable to Fire-aspected elemental attacks or simply to fire attacks such as  aming arrows.
   Unlike many elemental Charms, a Dragon-Blood can learn more than one version of Unassailable Body of (Element) Defense, but the Dragon-Blood must learn the version associated with her aspect first. Only one version can be used at a time, however. Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be a Fire-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack.</description>

        <description>This Charm permanently enhances a Dragon-Blood's Unassailable Body of (Element) Defense Charms, allowing her to dissolve on any tick unless environmental conditions disallow the specific version. Whenever she activates these Charms, she may also transform into an explosion of elemental energy that inflicts a number of levels of lethal damage equal to her Dodge to everything within (Dodge x 5) yards. The explosion also inflicts an appropriate aspect-based elemental effect as Elemental Bolt Attack (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, pp. 133-134). She immediately reintegrates anywhere within this radius as limited teleportation.</description>

        <description>By bolstering her body and spirit with the inviolable spirit of the Earth Dragon, the Dragon-Blood using this Charm can go without sleep for 24 hours without any ill effect. The character suffers no penalties for lack of sleep or fatigue and is fully alert at all times. The Exalt must still rest due to exertion, however. The Dragon-Blood can use this Charm for a maximum number of sequential days equal to her (Integrity + Essence) without ill effect. Thereafter, every additional day the Charm is used causes the Exalt to lose one temporary Willpower per day, and Willpower lost cannot be regained until after the Exalt has slept for 24 uninterrupted hours.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Earth Aspect can imitate the constancy of the Imperial Mountain itself. As long as the Dragon-Blood's feet touch the ground at least once every six ticks, he incurs no fatigue penalties from any source, whether from armor, encumbrance, physical exertion or magical effect. The Charm does not negate any fatigue penalties that were already in existence when the Charm was enacted, but it prevents the Exalt from becoming even more exhausted. The Dragon-Blood can also ignore wound penalties up to his permanent Essence rating. The effect of this Charm ends instantly once the Exalt's feet remain off the ground for more than six ticks. Wearing shoes does not impair the link with the earth, nor do cobblestones or building floors sever the link, provided that they rest on the ground. Therefore, a Dragon-Blood under the effects of this Charm remains alert while standing on the stone surface of the bottom floor of an inn, but once he ascends the stairs to the second floor, the Charm is disrupted.</description>

        <description>The devotion of the Princes of the Earth to their charges is unshakable. The Dragon-Blood holds a heightened sense of loyalty to a particular group of people (just as Righteous Lion Defense grants a Solar a heightened sense of loyalty to an ideal). The group may be the Dragon-Blood's House, his unit or ministry, his sworn brotherhood or even the Dragon-Blooded as a whole, although there is obvious danger in becoming preternaturally loyal to very large populations. Likewise, this Charm can be purchased multiple times representing occasions when the Dragon-Blooded swears a new oath of loyalty. The group to which the Exalt swears loyalty cannot be changed after it is chosen. When the Dragon-Blood is confronted by social attacks that go against his loyalty to his chosen group, he automatically adds his Integrity to his Mental Defense Value. The Integrity bonus can be added only once, even if the group he is being asked to betray falls under multiple groupings. That is, if a Dragon-Blood who has sworn loyalty to House Tepet and loyalty to the Third Legion is being manipulated into betraying a fellow soldier who is also a Tepet, the Dragon-Blooded still applies his Integrity bonus only once.</description>

        <description>For the duration of a scene, a Dragon-Blood can instantly dedicate herself to a new Intimacy - loyalty to another Dragon-Blood in her immediate vicinity. By doing so, the Dragon-Blood treats the loyalty as an additional Intimacy, with all the benefits and drawbacks thereof, even if this temporarily exceeds the maximum number of Intimacies the character can normally have. Therefineed be no particular form of connection between the Dragon-Blood and her new Intimacy - indeed, she might not even know his name - but the fact that he is a fellow Terrestrial is a source of comfort and strength to her. A Dragon-Blood may forge a number of new Intimacies equal to her Conviction during a given scene.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any regular tick or on any long tick during social combat.</description>

        <description>Just as the hottest of flames can lose its intensity unless it is contained by the walls of a furnace, so too does the steady strength of the Earth Dragon help contain and focus the inner flame of vengeance. To activate this Charm, the Exalt must spend three motes and one Willpower while speaking aloud the terms of a vendetta to which the character commits himself with all his soul. The goal must be a simply stated purpose such as "Avenge my father's death at the hands of Tepet Arada" or "Humble Sesus Chenow Lahor for his insult on my honor". Swearing such an oath provides the Dragon-Blood with several benefits.
   First, for as long as the vendetta lasts, it counts as an Intimacy for the Dragon-Blood with all the benefits and drawbacks of any Intimacy. Second, whenever confronted by any effect, magical or otherwise, that might deter the Dragon-Blood from pursuing his vengeance, he adds his Essence to his Dodge MDV. Furthermore, he can ignore any unnatural influence that would compel him to abandon the vendetta, treating such commands as unacceptable orders. Third, until the Exalt fulfills the vendetta or abandons it, he does not need to eat, sleep or rest as long as he remains in pursuit of his vengeance. The character incurs no penalties from any sort of fatigue, whether natural, magical or even from encumbrance or armor. Fourth, the Exalt can soak both lethal and bashing damage with his full Stamina, and he adds his Integrity to both his lethal and bashing soaks.
   Unflagging Vengeance Meditation can be sustained without ill effect for a number of days equal to the Exalt's Essence. After that, the character suffers one health level of unsoakable bashing damage every time a number of days equal to his Essence passes. This damage cannot be healed while the Charm remains in force, and even after the Charm lapses, healing this damage takes twice as long as normal. When a Dragon-Blood swears a vendetta with this Charm, a number of additional characters equal to his Essence can join him. Each additional participant must pay one temporary Willpower point but need not expend any Essence. Once invoked, the Charm ends either when the vendetta is satisfied or when the Dragon-Blood who initiated it voluntarily abandons it. If anyone who is party to the Charm, including the Dragon-Blood who initiated it, terminates his involvement prematurely, he suffers a number of levels of lethal damage equal to the sum of the permanent Essences of all characters involved. This damage is unsoakable in any fashion.</description>

        <description>A Dragon-Blood who has mastered this Charm can transform his mind and soul into unassailable towers capable of resisting all but the most potent of mind-altering powers. For the duration of a scene, the difficulty to use any supernatural effect against the Dragon-Blood that seeks to sway his emotions, control his mind or induce madness increases by the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. This Charm has no effect upon the Great Curse.
   While this version of the Charm is Earth Aspected, Dragon-Blooded of the Wood Aspect have access to similar Charm called Verdant Curtain of Serenity. The Wood-aspected version is identical to Granite Curtain of Serenity in all respects except that its minimum Ability is Medicine 5 and it requires Purity of Mind Method (see p. 176) as a prerequisite Charm instead of Ten-Thousand Dragons Fight as One.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood using this Charm can instantly overcome the effects of any natural or unnatural compulsion. Most commonly used to instantly break the hold of narcotic or similar addictions without going through a lengthy withdrawal, the Charm can also act as a perfect parry against any social attack, including those that incorporate unnatural mental influence. This Charm, however, has no effect against unnatural mental influence Charms used by beings whose Essence is higher than the Dragon-Blood's. The Willpower point spent on this Charm does not count toward the two-point maximum on Willpower points that must be spent within a scene in resisting natural mental influence.</description>

        <description>Inviolate Dragon SpiritSince the Usurpation, the Fair Folk and the other creatures of the Wyld have been the most persistent adversaries of the Dragon-Blooded. As the avatars of stability, it has fallen to the Earth Aspects to develop the means to counter the corrosive effects of Wyld energies. For the remainder of the scene after invoking this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can ignore Shaping effects, such as the mutational effects of the Wyld or the glamour sorcery of the Fair Folk. Both the Dragon-Blood's person and gear are protected and cannot be changed by such Wyld effects. The Charm does not protect against any Shaping effects brought to bear by Celestial Exalted, however, including Sidereal astrology. This effect can be extended to any number of other people by touching them and paying the full cost of the Charm for each of them.</description>

        <description>Perhaps the most recent Charm developed for the Dragon-Blooded arsenal, this Charm was created for the express purpose of facilitating the Great Uprising. While it is in effect, a Dragon-Blood may add her Essence to her Dodge and Parry DV against any attacks made against her by an Anathema, including sorcery or Charm-assisted attacks. She can also add her Essence to her Mental Dodge and Parry DV if confronted with an Anathema using mind-altering effects.
   Neither Eclipse nor Moonshadow Exalted are capable of learning this Charm, whose nature is fundamentally inimical to their Exalted natures.</description>

            <description>Gaia ordered that the Dragon-Blooded should be the perfect army for the Celestial Host. This Charm gets power from this unique relationship between Terrestrial and Celestial Exalted.

When using this Charm within (Essence x 100) yards of a Celestial Exalt, add the Terrestrial's Essence to his DVs and MDVs. The bonuses garnered from Defense-from-Anathema Method apply to all attacks the character experiences, regardless of their source, so long as the Charm remains in effect.</description>

        <description>The Dragons know they are invulnerable, and so they are. Upon activating Wound-Denying Dragon Faith, the character substitutes his Dodge MDV for his Dodge DV to defend against a physical attack (meaning his maximum DV bonus recalculates from his Willpower and Integrity ratings). All current bonuses and penalties that apply to either his Dodge DV or Dodge MDV apply to the DV generated by this Charm. If the Terrestrial dodges the attack, he appears to have exerted no effort to do so as though the attacker just missed. Solar and Abyssal Exalted have Mirror counterparts of this Charm named Invincible Ego Shield and Dark Will Triumphant (respectively) that have Cost: 5m, 1wp and Duration: One scene.</description>

        <description>It is said that blood is thicker than water. For the Dragon-Blooded, water is an insufficient comparison. Whenever a character with this Charm faces any form of mental or social influence from someone who isn't a blood relative that is intended to make him knowingly harm a blood relative through action or inaction, he treats the attempt as an unacceptable order. If the attack was clearly and intentionally directed to incite betrayal, the Exalt's player may have the character enter uncontrolled Limit Break to punish the would-be manipulator with just enough restraint to avoid harming blood relatives who stay out of the way.
   A blood relative is defined as anyone with whom the Exalt can trace mutual direct ancestry to a single Dragon-Blooded progenitor. The larger the character's family is, the broader the Charm's protection is (though the character relying on the benefit of the Charm must be aware of the relationship between himself and the person he would otherwise know-ingly harm). An Exalt with Essence 6+ extends the benefits of this Charm to all Dragon-Blooded direct descendents with Breeding 3+, allowing him to serve as the common ancestor defining blood relations. Such elders may also use the Martyr keyword to indefinitely extend these benefits as a bulwark against outsiders.
   The Family Background may be used to represent a character under the benefits of the Martyr form of this Charm (though only if the character possesses Breeding 3+), as with Honored Ancestor Exhalation. The Exalt is considered to be linked by the Charm's Martyr benefit to (Magnitude [2 + Number of dots of Family allocated]) other blood relatives.
   Storytellers should very carefully consider the implications of allowing characters in Second Age games to purchase this benefit, as it can easily grow to encompass entire Great Houses, potentially shifting the tone of an Exalted series. By default, it is assumed that the Empress has gone to great lengths to discourage the Martyr form of Thicker Than Stone from being used within her Dynasty, as it suits her purposes for her children to constantly be set at the throats of their brothers and sisters. Lookshy, by contrast, has no such ma-nipulative agenda, but the gentes of the Seventh Legion are considerably less numerous than their Dynastic counterparts and have fewer elders to learn the Charm.</description>

        <description>The best criminals can conceal their crimes by suppressing any feelings of guilt beneath a cool exterior. The Children of Daana'd, however, can look past the most placid surface to see what lies within the depths of the criminal's soul. After spending the requisite Essence, the Dragon-Blood's player can roll (Manipulation + Investigation). Even one success indicates to the Dragon-Blood which of the people currently before him is suffering from the greatest guilt. This analysis is purely subjective, and sometimes, a suspect in a crime who feels guilt over some unrelated misconduct might lead the investigator astray. Also, this Charm is useless against true sociopaths who feel no guilt whatsoever for their misdeeds. At the Storyteller's discretion, it might also fail to register the guilt of persons who feel completely justi ed in committing their crimes, such as a vigilante who has killed a particularly vile criminal.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, no attempt by a miscreant to muddy the waters of an inquiry can obscure the Dragon-Blood's natural clarity. The Exalt can target a single individual and, after activating the Charm, instantly know for the rest of the scene if the individual is knowingly lying about some subject. The Charm cannot detect half-truths, skillful evasions or wrong answers founded on ignorance - the target must know that her statement is unambiguously false. Also, if the target knows that she is under supernatural scrutiny, she can conceal a lie by spending one point of Willpower per falsehood. Finally, the Charm cannot detect lies uttered by a target whose permanent Essence is equal to or higher than that of the character who activated this Charm. To the character, any lies detected register as a slight tingling sensation on the back of his neck.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood must first spend 10 minutes investigating the scene of a crime (or any other event he wishes to investigate). The Dragon-Blood's player makes a normal Investigation roll for the Exalt to find ordinary pieces of evidence, although this roll can be augmented with other Charms. After spending the Essence and Willpower to activate this Charm, the player can then roll (Intelligence + Investigation), with even one success leading the Dragon-Blood in the general direction of the person who left the incriminating evidence. With three or more successes, the Dragon-Blood also receives a brief glimpse of the culprit at the scene of the crime. If the culprit uses some type of supernatural effect to protect her identity, this Charm fails automatically unless the Dragon-Blood has a higher Essence than the culprit. The Charm will always fail when confronted with a culprit using Trackless Walk Style (see p. 167).</description>

            <errText>This Charm does not function as printed. Instead, it allows the character to make a standard Investigation roll in a matter of seconds to find clues that would normally take ten minutes of careful searching. If the roll yields any successes, the Exalt also receives a brief murky glimpse of whatever individual the investigation is trying to locate (usually the criminal responsible for a crime). This glimpse is not enough to make an identification, but always contains clues that are relevant and useful in solving the mystery. The Charm automatically loses all roll-offs with other Charms that conceal evidence or otherwise contest its effects.</errText>

        <description>As flowing water erodes dirt to reveal what lies buried beneath, so does the Essence of the Princes of the Earth wash away attempts at concealment to reveal what lies hidden. When this Charm is activated, the Dragon-Blood's Essence washes out over an area with a radius no bigger than her Essence in yards. The released Essence glows briefly whenever it encounters anything that has been deliberately hidden. The Charm cannot locate items that have simply been lost. Instead, someone must have deliberately hidden each item. Also, there is no guarantee that any items discovered will be relevant to the current investigation. Therefore, if the Charm is used at the scene of a murder, it might reveal the victim's stash of opium hidden under a floorboard or her jewels locked up in a concealed wall safe. The Charm will not detect items concealed on someone's person, nor will it reveal items hidden by Celestial-level Charms or sorcery. Items concealed through lesser magic can be detected if the Dragon-Blood's player succeeds in a resisted (Perception + permanent Essence) roll against the Essence of the individual who used the concealing magic.</description>

        <description>Just as each individual drop of water in the ocean is connected to every other drop of water, so is each person connected spiritually to those close to her, from friends to family to accomplices. Upon meeting someone, the Dragon-Blood can gain an intuitive knowledge of the person's closest associates. Each success by the player on a (Perception + Investigation) roll gives the Dragon-Blood the name and a one-sentence description of two of the target's allies, contacts or employers, beginning with those most important to the target.</description>

        <description>By simply meeting someone and coming with a few yards of him, the Dragon-Blood can instantly know where the person's home is. Most commonly, "home" is the character's primary residence. In the case of Exalted, or other characters with significant holdings, the Charm identifies the place that the subject emotionally considers to be home. Alternatively, if the subject has one or more manses, the highest-rated manse is considered the target's primary residence. It is possible to ward a particular residence from discovery by this Charm through sorcery, but doing so simply points to the target's next most emotionally attached home. The Charm can identify only a building, not a particular apartment or room therein, and some individuals, such as itinerant monks, wandering traders or the impoverished might not register as having any home at all.</description>

        <description>As the geomantic presence of the Elemental Dragons flows through every corner of Creation, Gaia's component souls passively observe all that takes place within Creation's borders. The totality of this information is too much to consciously absorb, even for a Primordial, but uncounted fragments sink into the murky depths of collective memory. By means of this Charm, a Dragon-Blood may lift some of that information to the surface of his own mind.
   On activation, the Exalt poses a question and his player makes an (Investigation + Breeding) roll. Provided that some answer to the question has ever existed in Creation, the number of successes rolled indicates the clarity of the intuitive hunch the Dragon-Blood experiences, which is never a direct answer, but rather a clue directing her toward the answer. With one success, the clue is accurate but extremely cryptic. With three successes, the hunch provides useful but vague or incomplete information. With five or more successes, the clue is a vital piece of the puzzle, usually suggesting an angle of inquiry or action the Exalt hadn't previously considered. Repeated use of this Charm to explore the same topic yields no additional information until the Exalt has made sense of prior clues, as judged by the Storyteller.</description>

        <description>The Children of Mela often serve as the diplomatic corps of the Dragon-Blooded Host, and while  uency in foreign tongues often requires years of study, this Charm can reduce the necessary time to just an afternoon. The Dragon-Blood must spend at least one hour meditating and listening to a foreign language being spoken. He can then "absorb" that language into himself, becoming completely  uent in both conversation and literacy. The Charm lasts for one week, at which time the knowledge gained fades completely.</description>

        <description>Diplomacy is not the only purpose to which words can be directed, and the Children of Mela often make excellent cryptographers as well. With this Charm, an Exalt can hide sensitive material from prying eyes within a supernaturally complex code. The Dragon-Blood must fashion the document herself, and it can be no longer than a number of pages equal to her Essence. The player rolls (Intelligence + Linguistics), with the successes determining the number of successes needed for someone else to decipher the document. Additionally, each deciphering roll requires an (Intelligence + Linguistics) roll with a base difficulty equal to the permanent Essence of the character who fashioned the Cipher Missive (Each deciphering roll also represents a number of days equal to the Charm-user's permanent Essence). The character who uses this Charm may identify a number of individuals equal to twice his Essence who can read the document without difficulty. Alternatively, he can identify a single class of individuals, which must be limited and specific, who can freely read the document. For example, such classes might include "only magistrates" or "only members of House Iselsi".</description>

        <description>To the savants of the Dragon-Blooded, the efficiency with which information can be conveyed is almost as valuable as the information itself. With this Charm, an Air Aspect can convey complex information or directives to another with what appear to be only simple pictograms. In fact, the drawings are actually a complex arrangement of sigils that can contain surprisingly large amounts of information in a very dense package, from complex instructions for assembling a sophisticated piece of First Age technology to exacting directions revealing a hidden location.
   For the character to employ this Charm, the player must roll (Manipulation + Linguistics) at a difficulty of 2. Successes above this difficulty determine the level of complexity encoded into the pictogram, with each success over the threshold providing the equivalent of one minute of careful instruction that can be obtained through later study of the pictogram. The icon can be drawn or carved into any media the creator wishes, but doing so requires the expenditure of Essence. As a result, no one else can reduce the icon without another application of this Charm or a similar one. Icons created with this Charm are about two square inches in size per success.</description>

        <description>While the Language-Learning Ritual grants total  uency in a tongue for an extended period, this Charm allows the Dragon-Blooded to quickly grasp the essentials of an unknown language for a brief period. For the duration of the Charm, the Dragon-Blood can speak and understand any foreign language. Furthermore, in the presence of multiple people speaking different languages, the Exalted can understand and be understood by all of them. The maximum number of speakers with whom the Dragon-Blood can interact using a single application of this Charm is equal to the character's permanent Essence. Communication is limited, however, and the Dragon-Blood suffers a -4 penalty on all social and communicative actions, reduced by one for each point of permanent Essence by which she exceeds the minimum. Also, this Charm affects only verbal speech. Neither written speech nor sign language can be conveyed with this Charm.</description>

        <description>To the Children of Mela, words can be weapons just as deadly as a blade or an arrow. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can manipulate a conversation she overhears, causing other listeners to hear what she desires instead of what was actually said. The Exalt must be able to hear the conversation in order to manipulate it with this Charm, and while eavesdropping through Charms or other magical means is acceptable, the Dragon-Blood must be within (the Exalt's permanent Essence x 100) feet from all participants. The Dragon-Blood's player must roll (Manipulation + Linguistics), with the successes determining the level of control. One success allows the Dragon-Blood to alter minor details, enough to confuse, offend or even arouse one of the parties. Three or more successes allows the Exalt to alter significant details, perhaps enough to completely color one participant's impressions of another. With five or more successes, the Exalt can control any aspect of the conversation.
       Participants in the conversation may notice the effect with a reflexive (Wits + Perception) roll against a difficulty equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence. On a successful roll, the participant knows that the conversation is being manipulated and can attempt to communicate this through nonverbal means. On a failure, none of the participants recognize that their own words are being changed or that the other parties do not hear what the speaker intends to say. In the Realm, abuse of this Charm is a serious breach of etiquette. In some situations, it is even considered a crime.</description>

            <errText>The listed duration means the character must constantly reactivate the Charm to maintain its effects, but the cost to do so is 0m so long as the Exalt keeps targeting the same overall conversation. If using this Charm to alter the resolution of a target's social attacks, the Terrestrial replaces the target's dice pool with his own (Manipulation + [Presence or Performance as appropriate to the type of address]) and may use the hijacked action to do anything that is normally possible with a social attack using that dice pool (within the limits established by the successes rolled). Social attacks enhanced by magic are beyond the power of this Charm to twist. Used in mass combat to target an enemy unit in range, each success reduces the total number of relays it is considered to have (communication failure can result). If the unit leader realizes this is going on and successfully rallies for organization, relays are restored and the unit is immune to further use of the Charm for the rest of the scene.</errText>

        <description>The elocution and charisma of Air-aspected debaters is aston-ishing to behold, and never more so than when Essence powers their words. For the duration of this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can add a number of dice equal to his Essence to any speech-related roll, be it seduction, persuasion or intimidation. The Charm can normally only affect one listener at a time, but each extra mote spent doubles the number of listeners who can be affected. If the Charm is used defensively in social combat, add half the Exalt's Essence, rounded up, to his Parry MDV. The Dragon-Blood must be able to speak the listener's language, either naturally or with Charms, in order for this Charm to have any utility.</description>

        <description>The wind carries many things, and for the Children of Mela, sound is one of them. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can whisper his words aloud and know that the winds will convey them to his intended listener, wherever that listener is. For a base cost of one mote, the character can transmit one message to the ear of any single person within range. The words actually do not need to be spoken, but the Dragon-Blood must at least mouth them. The base range of the Charm is equal to (the speaker's Essence x 100) feet. Also, each additional mote spent increases the range by a factor of 10. Therefore, a character with an Essence of 4 can transmit a message 400 feet for one mote, 4,000 feet for two motes or 40,000 feet for three motes. This total quantity of motes must be expended for each individual message, which can be no more than 25 words in length.
   The sending character need not know the exact location of the intended recipient, but she must know her approximate location, which is defined as "within (sender's Essence x 5) miles". The targeted location can, however, be some place that the sender has never even been, such as "the command HQ of the Fourth Legion stationed in Arjuf". This Charm is considered essential to military operations for both the Realm and the Seventh Legion. Most Dragon-Blooded with any military background know this Charm, and all but the least proficient graduates of the House of Bells do.</description>

        <description>A favorite of spies and intelligence operatives across the Realm, this Charm permits a Dragon-Blood to hear the faintest trace of words echoing through the air, allowing him to eavesdrop on conversations at seemingly impossible distances. The Essence cost of the Charm is determined by how far away the Exalt is from the conversation he wishes to hear. For the basic cost, the Exalt can clearly hear any normal speech originating anywhere within (listener's Essence x 100) feet, as well as pinpoint the approximate location of the speaker if he doesn't already know. Each additional mote of Essence increases the range by a factor of 10.
   The Dragon-Blood must specify which speaker he desires to spy upon. He cannot indicate a general target such as "anyone plotting against me". Rather, he must name an individual and then listen to see if she is currently within range and speaking aloud. If he can hear a named speaker, however, the Dragon-Blooded can also automatically hear the replies of anyone in the speaker's immediate vicinity with whom she is conversing. This Charm cannot be used to listen to conversations taking place within airtight rooms, and it may also be defeated by certain supernatural warding effects. (Enchanted wind chimes are commonly used for this purpose). Finally, spying with this Charm demands total concentration, and the listener cannot perform any other action while this Charm is being employed.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, a Terrestrial Exalt and a number of her allies can communicate complex information silently through the use of hand gestures and signals. The Exalt can enable silent communication between only herself and a maximum number of allies equal to her (Wits + Linguistics). Although the communication is silent, all participants must be able to see each other, and it is obvious to any onlookers that the participants are communicating with each other. Therefore, this Charm is of limited utility in a social setting, as opposed to a combat or stealth situation. Also, at the Storyteller's discretion, extremely complex or abstract ideas might require a (Wits + Linguistics) roll on the part of both the person sending the message and all who wish to comprehend it. "You take the guy on the left, and I'll take the two on the right" should not require a roll, but the recitation of lyric poetry through hand gestures probably would.</description>

            <errText>The Exalt must be able to see all participants at the time of activation and can't change them without reactivation. The roll to transmit or understand complex messages is reflexive and mandatory, with a difficulty of 1-5 set by the Storyteller. Social attacks may be conveyed through gestures, but may also require a transmission roll for complex statements and automatically fail to affect targets who do not make a required understanding roll. A second purchase at Linguistics 5+ removes the need for transmission/understanding rolls and allows participants to gesture subtly enough that onlookers fail to recognize them as communication without a (Perception + Awareness) roll at a difficulty of the Exalt's Essence.</errText>

        <description>This Charm allows a unified group of Dragon-Blooded to "speak without words", moving as a single unit of such purpose that verbal orders are super uous and a waste of the commander's time. Effectively, the individuals linked with this Charm share their surface thoughts, which conveys several effects. First, all observations made by any participant are shared by all - what one sees, all see. Second, in a combat situation, all commands, warnings or observations are nonverbal. Members of the group can trade opponents, execute  anking maneuvers or warn each other of impending sneak attacks instantly and silently. If one  fighter is close enough, he can even parry or abort to parry any blow aimed at another, substituting his own PDV for that of his ally, provided he is close enough to the ally to plausibly do so.
   Third, for every two motes spent, each ally affected gains one dot each in Wits, Perception and Melee, although no one can gain more dots in a single category than the Exalt's Linguistics rating, nor can any participant raise an Attribute or Ability above five dots. Also, the Dragon-Blood must spend two motes per dot of increase for every participant. Therefore, if the Exalt wishes to affect three allies, raising each of the affected ratings by three dots, she must spend a total of 18 motes (six motes per point of increase, multiplied by three for the number of participants). The Exalt cannot raise different allies' Abilities by varying degrees at the same time, and he can't increase his own ratings through the use of this Charm.</description>

            <errText>This Charm links the Exalt and up to (Linguistics rating) individuals she can perceive within a mile for as long as those characters stay within this radius. Double the number of maximum participants if all members are blood relatives of the Terrestrial. The activation cost is 1m per character, but this is waived for any character the Exalt gifts with trait dots. The difficulty of the roll to coordinate attacks by linked members is only 1 and they may always parry on each other's behalf as though they had used a Defend Other action to set this up. Trait dots conferred by this Charm cannot increase another's rating above the Exalt's rating. Because the same bonus must be purchased for each beneficiary, the Terrestrial must still purchase wasted dots to give a higher bonus to members who can benefit from them. Used in mass combat, the Charm can link a unit leader with fellow officers, all of whom count as one additional relay regardless of actual role.</errText>

Even the mere suggestion that this Charm is often used by Dragon-Blooded thieves, spies and assassins is a blasphemy to some Immaculate monks. With just one success on a (Perception + Larceny) check, the Dragon-Blood instantly knows if he is being watched. Additional successes will pinpoint the specific location of observers.This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used on any tick.</description>

        <description>Notwithstanding the claims of Immaculate theology, Dragon-Bloods do make excellent spies and assassins, and all of the Great Houses have scions skilled at evading detection. While this Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood will leave absolutely no physical evidence of her identity at a location, such as a crime scene or the like. The Dragon-Blood will leave neither footprints nor fingerprints, even if he walks through mud or handles a sticky substance. Not so much as a single strand of hair will be left behind. The only exception is a clue that the Dragon-Blood may choose to leave at a crime scene, such as a calling card. Such deliberate clues can be left without otherwise weakening the Charm's effect. The Charm does not prevent supernatural tracking attempts, although it completely negates the effect of Bloodhound's Nose Technique (see p. 165). The Charm is best used for short periods of time, however, as it is inefficient for such actions as fleeing across a large forest without leaving tracks.</description>

        <description>The ability to eavesdrop is the essence of effective spying, and none are better at it than the Children of Daana'd. While this Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood can hear conversations and other sounds going on in adjacent rooms as if there were no walls in place, ignoring any penalties associated with obstacles between her and the objects of her attention. The Charm does not eliminate penalties due to distance, just physical obstructions. Consequently, most Dragon-Blooded who rely on this Charm also learn at least one reflexive Awareness Excellency that can be used concurrently with Ears of the Snowy Owl.</description>

The Exalt can fashion out of solidi ed Essence simple tools for picking locks, cutting through bars or jimmying doors. The Charm gives no particular benefit to the Exalt's attempt. It simply gives him access to tools of the trade he otherwise would not possess. The Charm requires a separate use for each individual Larceny task. If the Exalt summoned a hacksaw to cut through bars, it would last for the duration of the attempt. If, after bypassing the bars, the Dragon-Blood was confronted with a lock to be picked or even a separate set of bars to cut through, he would have to activate the Charm again.</description>

        <description>This Charm elevates common mimicry to supernatural levels. For the duration of a scene, the Dragon-Blood using this Charm can perfectly duplicate another person's voice or the sound of any animal, spirit or other creature, as well any other sound he hears. The character must have heard the voice or sound at least once, and his player must succeed on a (Perception + Larceny) roll for the character to properly remember all of the sound's nuances. The difficulty of the roll is determined by the nature of the sound to be duplicated. Duplicating the voice of a person is generally only difficulty 1, while mimicking an unusual animal might require two or three successes. Imitating the sound of a three-mouthed god who speaks only in music might have a difficulty of 5. This Charm will not duplicate any supernatural effects associated with the sound duplicated, such as an animal roar that invokes supernatural fear, and each different sound to be imitated requires a new use of the Charm. The Charm will automatically fool any animals trained to respond only to the voice of the person imitated, and it will automatically fool any person, including the closest associates of the person imitated, unless a listener is using a Charm or spell that improves hearing.
   Wood Aspects have access to a Performance Charm called New Voice Technique, which is functionally identical to this one except that it requires Performance 3 instead of Larceny 3.</description>

        <description>This Charm is employed by spies and forgers across the Realm. A character using this Charm can duplicate both the handwriting and writing style of another person. The character must either currently have a specimen of the writing to be duplicated or else the player must succeed on a (Perception + Larceny) roll to recall a sample of writing the character has observed in the past. The Charm can be used to forge anything from a simple signature to a document with a maximum number of pages equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence. Therefore, while the Charm can easily be used to falsify a legal document, writing an entire novel in the target's handwriting and style would require many repeated uses of the Charm. It is impossible to tell the forgery from the target's normal handwriting by any mundane means. If Charms or similar magic are brought to bear on the forgery, the difficulty for any roll for a person analyzing the document to discover the truth is increased by an amount equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence.</description>

        <description>This simple Charm allows a Dragon-Blood observing some kind of game or competition to instantly know if someone is cheating and how the cheating is being accomplished. The Dragon-Blood can observe only one game or competition at a time, but the Charm can be used on any such event, from footraces to duels to any type of dice or card game.</description>

        <description>This Charm, the use of which is highly illegal in both the Realm and Lookshy, permits a devious character to control a single event during the course of any game of chance, from a single throw of the dice to the draw of a single card. The Dragon-Blood using this Charm must be the one throwing the dice or drawing the card in order to get any benefit. Each new roll or draw demands a different use of this Charm, and frequent uses can exhaust the character's Essence pool rapidly.</description>

        <description>The pinnacle of the art of illegal gambling, this Charm permits the Dragon-Blood to automatically win whatever game she is playing. The game in question must be a game of chance, be it dice, cards, roulette or anything else in which luck is a determining factor. If two characters both use this Charm in the same game, the one with the highest permanent Essence wins. If both have the same Essence, the outcome of the game is determined by opposed (Wits + Larceny) rolls. A Dynast caught using this Charm faces serious social censure. A Dragon-Blood in Lookshy is more likely to face criminal charges, while one foolish enough to use this Charm in a casino operated by a god or Exalt risks a very unpleasant death.</description>

        <description>To leave no trace of oneself at the scene of a crime is the work of children. Master criminals and espionage agents among the Terrestrial Exalted may instead misdirect investigations toward their enemies. This Charm modifies its prerequisite; by activating Trackless Walk Style with a five mote surcharge, the Dragon-Blood may not only leave no trace of himself at a crime scene, but will also arrange the scene to leave subtle clues pointing toward the presence of another character of his choice. Any failed Investigation roll to gather clues at the scene of the crime where this Charm was used will provide a false positive response, indicating the presence and culpability of the selected individual. This unnatural Illusion costs one point of Willpower to see through, but characters normally do not attempt to do so unless presented with contradictory evidence, such as an airtight alibi.</description>

        <description>It is the nature of water to flow around all obstacles unchanged, and so it is for a Dragon-Blood with this Charm. Upon activation, the Exalt's body and personal possessions dematerialize, though he remains visible to materialized onlookers. While dematerialized, the character breathes the living Essence of Gaia instead of air, so he can "phase" through solid or liquid objects without worry but cannot draw breath outside Creation. Additionally, attacks enhanced by Charms or other magic besides Excellencies affect the character and any passengers as if they were corporeal unless the Exalt has Essence 6+.
   The character may share the benefits of this Charm with as many willing allies as he has dots of Essence, provided all join hands at the time of activation. If the Exalt ends the Charm or dies, all passengers have one action to vacate any solid objects before they materialize once more with whatever horrific consequences the Storyteller can devise.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood's Essence paints a complex glyph approximately a foot square in size on any sufficiently large object she is touching, most commonly a flag affixed to armor or a long weapon such as a spear. During the First Age, such glyphs often adorned the chest plates of warstriders. This symbol glows in the colors of its creator's anima while empowered by the commitment of her Essence and loses all power when this commitment ends. Repeated use of this Charm can empower as many pennants as the Exalt wishes to sustain.
   When carried into battle by any special character in a complementary unit, an object enchanted with this Charm allows that character to count as an additional relay to prevent communication failure and adds one to the unit's Morale (maximum Morale 5). These benefits are cumulative with each special character carrying such an item; they lapse whenever a standard-bearer perishes. A replacement capable of raising it may be ordered to do so as a diceless miscellaneous action.</description>

        <description>The voice of a progenitor lends hope and purpose to his descendents. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt chooses a Motivation (which may differ from his own). Whenever one of the Exalt's descendents channels a Virtue while taking an action that directly supports this Motivation, the descendant does not spend a Virtue channel to do so and substitutes her ancestor's Essence rating for the rating of the channeled Virtue. Because these dice are considered Virtue dice, such bonuses do not count against Excellency limits. Exalted may use only a single activation of this Charm at a time, and characters may tap into only one ancestor per action. With the Martyr effect, the Charm lasts as long as the family does, passing the legacy to each generation.
   Characters wishing to be part of a family lineage subject to a Martyr usage of this Charm may possess (subject to the Storyteller's approval) one such Motivation per dot of the Family Background (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 109). Buying Family in this manner negates the normal bonuses for buying that dot of the Background. Ancestors purchased with this Background are assumed to have died with Essence 6. Optionally, rather than using an additional dot of Family to add a second Motivation, such dots may be used to upgrade an existing ancestor's Essence rating by one dot, up to a maximum of Essence 8.</description>

        <description>The simplest of Lore techniques exercised by the savants of Air, this Charm allows a character to meditate on her aligned element to temporarily augment her capacity to absorb knowledge. Provided that the Exalt has all the necessary research material handy, she can absorb a week's worth of study in a single day. She can continue to use this Charm on subsequent days, but if she uses it more days in a row than a number equal to her Lore trait, she suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage for each extra day. The Exalt cannot heal this damage while under the effects of this Charm.</description>

        <description>Given the vast ages to which most of the Dragon-Blooded will survive, it's not surprising that their minds can become somewhat cluttered. This Charm allows the Exalt to attain perfect recall of any event he has experienced or anything he has ever read or heard. After spending the required Essence and Willpower, the Exalt must spend a moment in quiet contemplation. The Dragon-Blood's player then rolls (Intelligence + Lore), with the difficulty determined by how far back into the character's memories he wishes to delve. One success is sufficient to recall a hurried conversation from a few years back, while five permits the Exalt to recall events even from early childhood with perfect clarity. Some Dragon-Blooded savants even claim to recall memories of time spent in the womb through the use of this Charm. Eternal Mind Meditation does not impair the character in any way. He experiences the events of his past as memories, rather than as an immersive experience that might adversely affect his DV or his awareness of his surroundings.</description>

The Dragon-Blood can draw Essence directly from his aspected element, regaining a number of motes equal to his Lore Ability for every Willpower point spent. If the Dragon-Blood spends more Willpower points in a day than his Essence, each additional use of Willpower for this Charm will also inflict one level of unsoakable bashing damage. The character must be able to physically touch the element with which he is aligned in order to draw Essence from it.</description>

        <description>While Elemental Empowerment Meditation allows the Dragon-Blood to replenish her lost Essence, this Charm allows her to restore her own body, using the power of the elements to heal her injuries. The character must immerse herself in her favored element as much  as possible (standing in a burning fire, submerging herself in water, etc). and must spend five motes and one Willpower for every lethal health level healed or two motes per bashing level healed. This Charm cannot be used to heal aggravated damage, nor can it be used to restore lost limbs or heal other such mutilations.
   An Eclipse or Moonshadow Caste Exalt who learns this Charm can use the Charm with only the element associated with the teacher of the Charm. That is, if an Eclipse learns Elemental Succor Method from a Fire Aspect, he cannot heal himself by immersion in any other element.</description>

        <description>Sometimes referred to as "the Dragon's Claw", this Charm permits a Dragon-Blood to fire a bolt of elemental energy appropriate to his aspect from his hand toward a target. The bolt is targeted with (Dexterity + Athletics) or (Dexterity + Archery), whichever is preferred, with an Accuracy bonus equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence and a range of (Essence x 20) yards. The bolt inflicts 2L per mote spent up to a maximum number of motes equal to the Dragon-Blood's Stamina. The bolt also has an elemental aspect and triggers the following elemental effects: Air buffets the target, subtracting two dice from her next action. Earth triggers a tremor beneath the target's feet, forcing her player to roll (Dexterity + Athletics), difficulty 4, to keep the character from falling. Firesets the target ablaze for a single action (+4L to the attacker's damage pool). Water  lls the target's lungs with seawater, adding three ticks before her next action due to violent coughing. Woodexposes the target to a plant toxin, requiring a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll, with a difficulty equal to (the Dragon-Blood's Essence), to avoid suffering a -1 penalty on all actions for the remainder of the scene.
   Multiple Dragon-Bloods who know this Charm can combine their powers to generate a bolt of exceptional power. One Exalt (usually the one with the best attack pool or the one with the highest Stamina rating) must serve as the focus, with his (Dexterity + [Athletics or Archery]) used to determine the base attack pool. Additionally, the Stamina of the focus determines the maximum number of motes that each participant can spend, with the total number of motes spent determining the base damage pool. In other words, if the focus has a Stamina of 4, then no participant can expend more than four motes to fuel the bolt. The Accuracy bonus of the attack is based on the Essence of the focus but gains a +1 bonus per additional participant. The range of the attack is equal to (the combined Essence of all participants x 20) yards. Finally, the elemental side effects of each separate aspect who aids in this Charm are inflicted upon the target. If multiple Dragon-Blooded of the same aspect aid in this Charm, however, their special elemental effect is applied only once. Therefore, if an Earth Aspect, two Fire Aspects and a Water Aspect combine to fire a single bolt, the player of the target - if successfully hit - must roll to avoid falling and will be delayed an additional three ticks before his next action due to the seawater, but only four dice are added to the damage pool due to fire damage, rather than eight.
   Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, this Charm is always considered to be an Air-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies, and Dragon-Blooded can only learn the version associated with their aspects.</description>

            <errText>Additional purchases of this Charm enable evocation of elements other than the Terrestrial's aspect, but each activation can only express one known element. The bolt may also be aimed with Thrown. Characters can always enhance a bolt's accuracy with Lore Excellencies (or Athletics Excellencies, if using that Ability).

        <description>This Charm is identical to Elemental Bolt Attack in all respects except the following. First, each mote spent on the burst inflicts only one level of lethal damage. Second, the burst inflicts damage across a circular area with a radius equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence in yards. The burst attack has a range increment of (permanent Essence x 20) yards and an Accuracy bonus equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. The burst also applies elemental effects identical to the Elemental Bolt Attack to each person caught within the burst radius. If multiple Exalted who know this Charm join together, the power of the elemental burst is calculated in the same manner as the elemental bolt, and the radius of the burst is equal to the combined permanent Essences of all participants in yards.</description>

        <description>The strength of the Dragon-Blooded lies not in their individual prowess, but in their vast collective might. Upon activating this Charm, the user and every Terrestrial within a one-mile radius feels a sense of kinship and pride in their race. This feeling instantly forges an Intimacy of loyalty to the Dragon-Blooded Host as a whole, which endures or fades normally once the Charm ends. Only those in range when Endless Coils Enlightenment activates are targeted, and they remain affected regardless of distance. Those who later enter the radius are not affected.
   Whenever a Terrestrial dies while affected by this Charm, every other affected character temporarily learns every Dragon-Blooded or Terrestrial Martial Arts Charm the deceased knew until the end of the scene, provided they meet trait minimums. (Out-of-aspect mote costs apply.) If the user of Endless Coils Enlightenment dies before the end of the scene, the effect continues for its full duration.</description>

        <description>Once a Dragon-Blood has completely mastered a Terrestrial style, she may shape her Essence skillfully enough to mimic the elemental nature of that style's elemental aspect. When using Terrestrial martial arts Charms with that affinity, she pays no elemental surcharge.
   Water-aspected Dragon-Blooded retain the unique ability to pay no surcharge on any Terrestrial styles. Using this Charm to emulate water Essence does not eliminate the need to pay surcharge on any styles, though - only on Terrestrial styles that are specifically Water-aspected (such as Terrestrial Hero Style).
   Note that this technique for overcoming elemental boundaries is inferior to that of studying the Glorious Dragon Styles, which can provide one with a far more complete mastery of one such element.</description>

        <description>The Exalt launches a formalized flurry of blows at a willing Exalted student, compressing every movement and stance of a Celestial martial arts style into a single kata. At the conclusion of the display, the pupil falls unconscious, his body and soul forcibly battered into submission. Over the next five days, his fevered dreams extract lessons from the repeated memory of the kata. If he lacks a Motivation centered on learning martial arts, the overwhelming insights shatter his mind, and he never awakens from the coma. With sufficient dedication, he awakens knowing the Charms Tiger-and-Bear Awareness and Tiger-and-Bear Unity (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 195) as a Training effect. If he is a Dragon-Blood, he may then practice Celestial martial arts like any Terrestrial who learns these Charms in a conventional manner. With Martyr usage, the pupil awakens (assuming he does so) knowing all Charms for one entire Celestial martial art that the teacher knew as a Training effect, on top of the basic initiation. He cannot use any Charms for which he fails to meet the trait minimums until he raises those traits to appropriate levels. Drowning in Understanding Kata is a Celestial martial arts Charm and may be learned as such.
   Incidentally, an Essence 7+ Sidereal with mastery of a Sidereal martial arts style may use this Charm's Martyr effect to impart that style in a single scene of training (using the aforementioned rules for style gifting). If the pupil lacks the right Motivation, has not mastered a Celestial style or is incapable of learning Sidereal martial arts, he dies at the end of the scene instead of his teacher.</description>

        <description>Medicinal knowledge can kill as well as heal, infect as well as purify. The Dragon-Blood using this Charm can enchant her weapon so that any wounds it causes are much more likely to become infected. When this Charm is invoked, the difficulty to resist infection from a lethal wound inflicted by the Dragon-Blood increases by two, even for Exalted. The Essence must be spent before the attack roll, and the attack must inflict at least one level of lethal damage or the Essence is wasted. Using this Charm against a fellow Dragon-Blood is a sure way for the character to win enemies for himself, as there is no weapon more hated or feared in the Age of Sorrows than disease. This Charm is explicitly allowed to be used in Combos with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>This Charm elevates the Wood Aspects to the status of healers of legend, although its failure during the time of the Great Contagion was a mighty blow to the Wood Aspects' collective pride. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can cure any non-magical disease with a touch. She must first make an ordinary diagnosis with her Medicine Ability prior to attempting to heal the disease, as she must understand what kind of plague confronts her. If the diagnosis is successful, the Dragon-Blood need only spend the Essence and Willpower and touch her patient to purge the illness from the patient's body. This purge is quite violent, and the patient is likely to convulse and expel the sickness, in the form of a repulsive ichor from his mouth, nose and elsewhere as soon as the Charm takes effect. If this occurs during combat, the patient is automatically rendered inactive for a number of actions equal to the disease's Treated Morbidity (see Exalted, p. 350). The Dragon-Blood can cure a magical disease only if his permanent Essence equals or exceeds the Magical Treatment difficulty for the illness, and no Dragon-Blood is capable of curing the Great Contagion with this Charm.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can cause himself or someone else to more quickly heal even the most serious of injuries. For every three motes spent, the Dragon-Blood can convert one level of aggravated damage into lethal damage. Healing even one level of damage also automatically closes any bleeding wounds. This Charm can be used on someone else just as easily as the Exalt uses it on himself. The Dragon-Blood must spend one Willpower per aggravated health level converted. Damage converted from aggravated to lethal can be further transformed into simple bashing damage through a subsequent application of Wound-Closing Touch.</description>

        <description>There is more to the healing arts than rejuvenation of the body. A good physician must also tend to his patient's mind. This Charm permits a Dragon-Blood to analyze another character and diagnose any external influences that cloud her mind. Such influences can include mind-effecting sorcery or Charms, as well as derangements. The Dragon-Blood's player must roll (Perception + Medicine) at a difficulty of 2. If the roll is successful, the Exalt can detect the existence of any external influences on the target as well as the nature of any derangements. With four or more suc-cesses, the Dragon-Blood can trace external magical influences back to their source or instantly understand the root cause of any natural derangement (adding two dice to any subsequent attempt to cure the patient of her mental illness). The Dragon-Blood can-not use this power on himself. The Charm can diagnose a patient suffering from a low-Willpower compulsion and even identify the approximate nature of any Exalt's Virtue Flaw while he is in Limit Break, but it can neither diagnose nor aid in curing any aspect of the Great Curse.</description>

            <errText>The Charm can diagnose any externally-imposed conditions that negatively affect the patient's mind, as well as all insanity arising from external trauma or poor health. Having Virtues with a rating of 1 is considered madness. The Charm detects unnatural mental influence, but not natural. Learning the source of a particular effect means it becomes Obvious to the Exalt, not that he knows who specifically caused it or when.</errText>

        <description>With a simple kiss to the patient's forehead, the Dragon-Blood can exert mastery over the illness that plagues the patient's mind. This Charm can instantly remove any normally acquired derangement from the patient. The Dragon-Blood must first have used Madness-Analyzing Stare to isolate the root cause of the patient's mental problems, and the Charm must be used multiple times if the patient has multiple maladies. In addition to normal derangements, the Charm will instantly end the effects of any Charms exerting unnatural mental influence over the patient except for Servitude effects. The Dragon-Blood must spend 10 motes instead of five in order to defeat a mental influence Charm used by a Celestial Exalt. This Charm can counteract mental influences caused by sorcery, but only if the spell's effect was instant. Ongoing effects can only be countered by Emerald Countermagic or similar spells. This Charm has no power in the face of the Great Curse.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Exalt approaches the Immaculate Dragons themselves in his understanding of the interrelationship between the physical body and the Essence that animates it. This Charm allows the Dragon-Blood to tap into the hidden wellspring of Essence within himself by sacri cing some of his own health and vitality to release new Essence for more immediate use. The player of the character invoking this Charm must decide how many health levels are to be sacri ced in its activation. He then rolls (the character's permanent Essence + Medicine). Each success on the roll grants one mote of Peripheral Essence per health level expended. The resulting damage to the Dragon-Blooded is considered lethal, and any resulting damage penalties do not apply until after the roll is made for this Charm. Essence gained in this way can increase the character's Peripheral Essence pool in excess of its normal limit, but any such excess Essence is lost at the end of the scene.</description>

            <description>The Terrestrial calls upon the blood of the Elemental Dragons to awaken and cleanse his body of dangerous impurities. Liquid Essence glows visibly as it spreads through the arteries and veins beneath his skin, growing into a web of vibrant pulsing light in the color of his anima. The Dragon-Blood can activate this Charm to defend against any Sickness effect, rolling (Intelligence + Medicine + Breeding) at a difficulty of its Virulence. A successful roll perfectly defends against the effect. Sicknesses that lack a Virulence rating cannot be negated, as many Dragon-Blooded discovered in the throes of the Great Contagion.
   A second purchase of this Charm allows it to be used against Poison, substituting Toxicity for Virulence in calculating the difficulty of the activation roll.
   An identical Charm exists in Resistance called Purifying Blood Ascendancy, with Any Resistance Excellency as its prerequisite. The activation roll of this variant is (Stamina + Resistance + Breeding).</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blooded are each attuned to one of the five elements, but like all living beings, each also contains a piece of all five elements. Having mastered the secrets of life itself, the Dragon-Blood who knows this Charm can cause the seed of any of the five elements to blossom within herself. For the duration of this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can assume the elemental aspect of any element other than the one to which she is normally aligned. The Dragon-Blood's anima power changes to that of the new element, and she will find that she need no longer pay the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms for the new aspect, but must pay it for her old aspect. If the Dragon-Blood has mastered an out-of-aspect Glorious Dragon Style, she can still use Charms of that aspect without paying a surcharge, and she cannot change her "extra" aspect with this Charm. Only her natural aspect is affected. The character can end the effects of this Charm on any tick during the scene as a reflexive action, but doing so will instantly terminate any benefits gained from the use of the new anima power.
   Because the Charm lasts for only a scene, it cannot affect which Abilities are considered favored by the character for experience cost or training time purposes. Many elemental Charms have different effects depending on the aspect of the Dragon-Blood who uses them. Some only allow a Dragon-Blood to use the version associated with her normal aspect, while others represent a cluster of five elemental Charms that can all be learned independently. If a Dragon-Blood who deploys Most Bene cent Seed of the Five Dragons has any elemental Charms of the former group, the aspect of those Charms switches to the Exalt's new aspect for the duration of the scene. If the Dragon-Blood has any Charms of the latter group (i.e., Charms that can be learned for any aspect), those Charms are not altered. This Charm is explicitly allowed to be included in Combos along with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood can pay one mote when activating the Charm's prerequisite to fill the patient's body with a soft green glow. No damage is actually mended, but the patient stops bleeding and does not continue to die if mortally wounded. All Sickness and Poison effects also go into remission (as do new effects applied while the Charm is active), effectively "stopping the clock". After a number of hours equal to the Terrestrial's Medicine rating or upon suffering new levels of damage, the patient must have a new infusion or her metabolism restarts (possibly with fatal results).</description>

        <description>Beyond mere modulations of aspect, Transcendent Gaian Harmony exploits the inherent interconnectedness of the Elemental Dragons as part of a greater whole. Upon purchasing this Charm, the Exalt permanently gains the anima power of a chosen aspect and no longer has to pay the surcharge to use Charms of that aspect. Whenever he uses a Charm with different effects per aspect, he may choose which known element to express. Charm clusters purchased separately by element are not affected. This Charm does not actually change the Exalt's aspect, it merely permits incorporation of subsidiary elements.
   Characters can purchase this Charm once per dot of Essence they have above 5, allowing a theoretical Essence 9 Dragon-Blood to integrate all five elements. Savants postulate that a fifth purchase might facilitate evolution into an entirely new type of being.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood has achieved a unity with his weapon that allows him to impart some of his elemental nature to it. On a successful melee attack, the Dragon-Blood may also inflict an elemental effect appropriate to his aspect on the target. Air buffets the target, subtracting two dice from her next action. Earth triggers a tremor beneath the target's feet, forcing her player to roll (Dexterity + Athletics), difficulty 4, to keep the character from falling. Firesets the target ablaze for a single action, giving a +4L bonus to the Dragon-Blood's damage dice pool. Water  lls the target's lungs with seawater, adding three ticks before her next action due to violent coughing. Wood poisons the target's blood, causing her to suffer a -1 penalty on all actions for the scene if her player fails a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll.
       Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, this Charm is always considered to be a Fire-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies, and Dragon-Blooded can learn only the version associated with their aspects.</description>

        <description>When swords clash, they inevitably give off sparks. Ordinarily, these sparks are an annoyance at most, but few Dragon-Bloods are ordinary. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can manipulate such sparks, augmenting them into fiery luminescence with his Essence and then sending them cascading into his opponents eyes. The Exalt can activate this Charm reflexively whenever he successfully avoids an attack from a metal weapon with his Parry DV or simply when he strikes any metal or stone object with his sword, including successful parries. The Essence spent multiplies what would normally be a few flying sparks into a crackling blue and gold spray that  ies into his opponent's eyes. The opponent is blinded for the following action, causing her to lose two successes from all attack rolls made for her. If the player of the opponent succeeds on a reflexive (Wits + Dodge) roll to have the character look away, however, he suffers only a two-die penalty instead of losing two successes.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated only on a tick upon which the Dragon-Blood acts, on any intervening tick upon which the Dragon-Blood uses a Counterattack Charm or on any intervening tick upon which the Dragon-Blood evades an attack with his Parry DV.</description>

            <errText>The Charm may be activated in response to any attack the Exalt defended against with a Melee-based parry, even if that parry was not sufficient to prevent a hit. The Terrestrial chooses a target within two yards (who need not be the attacker) and the Charm throws sparks at that target as an unblockable, undodgeable -0 DV counterattack. If this hits and the target successfully looks away, she suffers a -2 internal penalty to all non-reflexive actions until her DV refreshes twice. If she doesn't look away, the penalty increases to -4.</errText>

        <description>Since the Great Uprising, the Dragon-Blooded have accepted the burden of defending the masses of humanity against the depredations of angry ghosts and truculent spirits. Chief among their arsenal in this ongoing battle is this Charm, which permits a Dragon-Blood to charge his melee weapon with Essence so that it can damage ghosts and spirits even while they are dematerialized. Additionally, if the Exalt spends four motes instead of just two, the weapon is considered Holy for the Charm's duration and inflicts aggravated damage against creatures of darkness. The charge lasts for only a single action, although its effects do apply to each attack in a flurry. Essence for the Charm must be spent before the attack is initiated. The Charm provides no additional bonus against creatures not born of darkness.</description>

Then, she can fashion a sword or other melee weapon out of thin air from the element to which she is aspected. The weapon has the traits of a normal weapon of its type, as well as the benefits conferred by the Dragon-Graced Weapon Charm (see p. 155) appropriate to the Dragon-Blood's aspect and is also considered Holy against creatures of darkness. The conjured weapon lasts for the entire battle or for one scene, whichever ends first. At the conclusion of the Charm's duration, the weapon dissipates harmlessly into a puff of Essence.</description>

        <description>Although this Charm is costly, it is still prized by Dragon-Blooded soldiers, as it is as close as mere Terrestrial Exalted can come to a perfect melee defense. After an opponent's hand-to-hand attack, the Dragon-Blood's player must roll (Dexterity + Melee). Regardless of the attacker's successes, if the Dragon-Blood achieves even one success, the attack is totally blocked. This Charm will not block either sorcerous attacks or attacks enhanced by Charms, but it is otherwise treated as a perfect parry.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated only on a tick on which the Dragon-Blooded is the target of an attack, though.</description>

        <description>A proper Terrestrial swordsman attains intimate awareness of her favored artifact weapon long before she achieves superhuman mastery. With this Charm, a jade weapon's least god becomes a component of its master's soul, forging permanent attunement without committed motes. Thereafter, the weapon cannot be harmed by any force as long as its owner lives, nor may others attune to or wield it without botching each action taken with it. While the proper character wields it with Melee (or Martial Arts, if it's designed for such use), the weapon glows sun-bright with all benefits of a weapon enhanced by the Charm Dragon-Graced Weapon (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 156) in accordance with the wielder's Aspect, plus adding its owner's Essence to its Accuracy, Damage, Defense and Rate. If the weapon is within (Melee x 5) yards, its owner may reflexively draw it to her empty hand in a bright flash for one mote.
   Once a character learns this Charm, she can exchange her weapon for another of equal or greater power by paying three experience points, but purchasing this Charm again insults both weapons and forfeits all bonuses.
   Solar Exalted possess a similar Charm called Honored Companion of the Sun. It is identical to Ordained Talon of Draconic Fury except for the following aspects: its prerequisites are Fire and Stones Strike and Summoning the Loyal Steel; it may only be used on orichlacum weapons; it lacks the Elemental Keyword; and it does not replicate Dragon-Graced Weapon. The weapon raises the Solar's minimum damage by one and counts 10s twice for the purpose of determining damage. Unlike Dragon-Blooded, Solars may buy this Charm as many times as desired to cover different weapons.
   Finally, the Lawgiver's Lunar mate may wield a weapon enhanced with Honored Companion of the Sun without requiring attunement or suffering botches, if the Solar desires.</description>

In both diplomacy and spycraft, they used this Charm, which allows a Dragon-Blood to see the reflection of unmanifested spirits in any reflective surface, such as a mirror, a polished sword or even a still pool of liquid. Furthermore, the Dragon-Blood can hear the voices of any spirits he can see, allowing for both conversations and, perhaps, discrete eavesdropping.</description>

        <description>Of all the spirit courts, the Air Aspects, have the greatest affinity for the courts of the sky. This Charm calls upon that elemental affinity to allow the Dragon-Blooded to invoke the power of the air spirits to summon a helpful wind. The wind summoned is not particularly strong, but it is powerful enough to interfere with Archery, adding half the Exalt's Essence to his DV against archery attacks. It is also powerful enough to affect the speed of a sailing ship, either adding or subtracting half the Dragon-Blood's Essence from the ship's Speed for the duration. The Air Aspect must spend about five minutes summoning the air spirits, usually through such activities as whistling, imitating the sounds of storms, whirling a bullroarer or simply playing a flute. The friendly spirits summoned will obey the Dragon-Blood's will (subject to their limited capabilities) for one hour. During that hour, the Exalt must spend one Miscellaneous Action (5 ticks) whistling or singing in order to change the wind's direction.
   Water-aspected Dragon-Bloods have access to a functionally identical Sail Charm called Seven Seas Wind-Luring Chanty. The only differences between the two Charms are that the Water aspect version requires Sail 2 instead of Occult 2, has Hurricane-Predicting Glance as a prerequisite Charm in place of Spirit-Detecting Mirror Technique and requires the Exalt to be at sea.</description>

            <errText>This Charm does not summon an actual spirit, but rather invokes the power of such beings to create winds that may blow anywhere within a radius of (Occult x 100) yards around the Terrestrial. Multiple currents can blow in different directions within the radius, typically to help allies while hindering enemies. When using this Charm to speed or slow a vehicle propelled by the wind (such as a ship or airboat with sails), the net modifier to per tick speed is the Exalt's (Sail + Essence) and this is applied after any adjustments to the vehicle's own speed. Changing the wind's direction or rearranging where it blows within the permitted radius is a diceless miscellaneous action.</errText>

        <description>Spirit-Detecting Mirror Technique Since the Usurpation, the Dragon-Blooded have accepted the role of defender of humanity against exploitation by spirits and ghosts run amok. This Charm has greatly aided the Dragon-Blooded in that role. When the character utters the Spirit-Grounding Shout, a reflexive opposed Essence roll is made for both her and the target spirit. If the Exalt wins, the spirit is forced to materialize and remain corporeal for a minimum of the character's permanent Essence in minutes. The Essence cost of the spirit's materialization is first paid for from the spirits' reserves. If the spirit does not have the Essence to materialize, then the balance is paid from the character's Essence pool. If the Dragon-Blooded and the target spirit do not have sufficient Essence between them to pay for the materialization cost, the Charm automatically fails, and the five motes spent by the character is lost. (Any motes that would have been spent by the spirit or the Dragon-Blood to pay for materialization remain unspent, though). The Charm likewise fails if the Dragon-Blood's player fails to get more successes on the opposed Essence roll than the target spirit does, and the Charm never affects spirit whose permanent Essence is higher than the Dragon-Blood's.</description>

            <errText>A spirit forced to materialize must still possess the Materialize Charm to do so, but accomplishes forced materialization reflexively. If the spirit lacks sufficient motes to accomplish this, the Terrestrial knows how many motes are still required and may pay them. If he does not, the spirit also spends no motes and the Charm does nothing.</errText>

        <description>With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can temporarily immobilize a spirit, often as a prelude to more permanent measures. The character must successfully strike the spirit with an attack, then the player can make a reflexive (Intelligence + Occult) roll with a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence. Each extra success imposes a one-die penalty to all actions the spirit takes for the next five minutes. If the extra successes exceed the spirit's permanent Essence, the spirit is completely immobilized and unable to act for the remainder of the scene. Subsequent uses of this Charm have a cumulative effect as long as the original application of the Charm has not lapsed, as do applications of the Charm by other Dragon-Blooded. The Charm also affects unmanifested spirits, but the Exalted must be able to see and touch the spirit to bind it. The Charm does not automatically render an attack capable of affecting unmanifested spirits. Spirit-Chaining Strike is explicitly permitted to be made a part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>This weapon in the Dragon-Blooded arsenal is especially hated and feared by the spirit hierarchies and is a significant explanation of how the Immaculate Order was  nally able to bring the spirits of the Blessed Isle to heel. The Dragon-Blood must first make a successful attack against a spirit, either while the spirit is materialized or with some weapon or attack capable of affecting dematerialized spirits. The attack inflicts its normal damage. In addition, the attacker's player reflexively rolls (the character's Willpower + Essence) against a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence. Each success reduces the spirit's temporary Essence by an amount equal to the Dragon-Blooded character's permanent Essence. The character does not steal the Essence, it dissipates into the air. If the spirit is destroyed by this Charm, that spirit is irrevocably gone.</description>

        <description>This Charm is most often used by independent surveyors and the professional jade sniffers of the Thousand Scales. For the duration of the Charm, the Dragon-Blood can detect the presence of jade within a radius of (Essence x 200) yards. If the jade to be detected is elementally aspected with the Dragon-Blood, no roll is required. If the jade is of a different aspect, the Exalt's player must roll (Perception + Occult) at a difficulty of 3. If the Dragon-Blood has an Occult rating of 3 and an Essence of 2, he can also detect other magical materials at a difficulty of 3, but only at a range of (Essence x 50) yards.
   This Charm cannot be used to perceive magical materials that are already attuned to someone else, nor can it be used to detect any quantity of such materials that are being concealed through the use of Celestial or Solar level magic, including Charms or spells. If Terrestrial magic is being used to conceal the material, the Dragon-Blood's player must garner more successes on the (Perception + Occult) roll than successes on the roll made to conceal the material or the Essence of the character using the concealing magic (whichever is higher).</description>

        <description>This Charm is especially favored by the savants and engineers of Lookshy, who must often contend with relics of the First Age discovered in the barrens of the Scavenger Lands. When confronted by an unidentified artifact, the character must handle the item in question as if he were attempting to attune it before spending the required Essence. The Exalt's player then rolls (Perception + Occult) for the character, with a difficulty rating equal to the item's Artifact rating. (Some artifacts are specially designed to conceal their functions, and analyzing such items carry a higher difficulty). Success on this roll immediately gives the character a rough idea of the item's power level, as indicated by its Artifact rating, with additional successes giving greater insights into the item's capabilities. Large, powerful or exceptionally complex artifacts might require multiple uses of this Charm in order to fully understand their workings. This Charm is ineffective on artifacts that are already attuned to other people.</description>

            <errText>This Charm can never discern the workings of N/A Artifacts and may only analyze simple artifacts by default. Analyzing the product of exotic crafts like Magitech or Genesis require that the Exalt have at least one dot in that Craft. Large artifacts require 2 uses to yield any useful information for anything up to the size of a warstrider or 3 for anything bigger (+1 if not a simple artifact). With Occult 5+, the Exalt may analyze artifacts attuned to others.</errText>

        <description>By means of this charm, a Dragon-Blood may physically meld with an elemental of the same aspect as himself in order to wear its power. To activate this Charm, the Exalt must successfully reach into the center of the elemental's body as an unarmed attack. His player then makes a (Charisma + Occult) roll with a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence (unless the spirit cooperates, which removes the need for the roll). Bonding with an elemental whose Essence is greater than the Exalt's is impossible. Upon a successful activation, the elemental's form oozes into the Dragon-Blood's aspect markings and becomes part of his body. For as long as the Charm lasts, the spirit cannot be physically attacked, and the Exalt knows all of its Charms. If the Exalt dies, so does the spirit. Melding also carries lingering psychological side effects for both parties, as each chooses one Intimacy per scene to give to the other. Exalted who frequently use this Charm evince all manner of unusual quirks and appetites. This Charm may be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>From time to time, an Exalted warrior  finds herself in the difficult position of being forced to fight when it is undesirable to be seen  fighting. Sometimes, the Dragon-Blood is forced to  fight an ally under some kind of mind control and she does not wish to let enemies know of her circle's internal strife. Other times, the Dragon-Blood might be undercover in an enemy city and need to subdue her opponents in a public place without bystanders calling out the city guards. With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can place anyone observing her combat under the illusion that the combat itself is not a serious  fight. Depending on the circumstances and how the Dragon-Blood chooses to manipulate the Charm, observers might believe that the  fight is simply some kind of street theater or that an implacable enemy assassin is simply a "drunken friend who has had too much ale". Regardless of the context, affected observers believe that the  fight is entertaining and nonthreatening, and they will generally refrain from attempting to intervene or from calling for the guards.
   The Dragon-Blood can disguise a con ict between herself and a single person plus one additional extra per extra mote spent. She cannot disguise a con ict if her enemies include more than one character who is not an extra. The other combatants in the  fight are not affected by this illusion, and nothing prevents one of them breaking off the  fight to summon help while the others continue to  fight. Anyone who knows for certain that the  fight is real before the Charm is activated (such as allies of the other combatants who were not close enough to Join Battle at the time) is unaffected. Likewise, anyone who arrives on the scene later during the  fight with reason to believe the  fight is real (such as allies who were summoned by a combatant who ran off to get help) is unaffected. If someone does arrive after the Charm's activation, however, the Dragon-Blooded can add him to the "mock  fight" with the reflexive expenditure of a single mote of Essence, so that the arrival of new combatants will not break the Charm's hold on bystanders. This Charm does not fool characters with an Essence rating higher than the character using the Charm, nor does it affect any character whose Dodge MDV is higher than the Dragon-Blood's (Performance + Essence).
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used on any tick.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blooded are social creatures, enamored of culture and art, but they are also creatures of violence, passion and cunning artifice. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood who is currently engaged in a performance of some kind can initiate a surprise attack on a target while disguising it as simply another part of   178 the performance. The player of the target can attempt a reflexive (Wits + Awareness) roll to anticipate the sneak attack, but the difficulty is equal to the Exalt's Essence. If that roll is unsuccessful, the target's DV is reduced to zero for the Dragon-Blood's surprise attack. Any target will realize that he has been attacked after he has taken any damage, but if an attack misses, the target might not even notice that it took place unless at least one success is rolled for him on a (Wits + Awareness) roll. Also, if the damage to a target is sufficient to kill the target with a single blow, bystanders might not even notice that an attack took place until the victim's body is discovered. This discovery might take some time if, for example, the target was slain in his box seat by a singer performing on stage at an opera. This Charm cannot be used after combat has begun. It can be used only while the Dragon-Blood is in the midst of some kind of performance activity.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used only on a tick upon which the Dragon-Blood acts.</description>

            <errText>Use of this Charm enhances the (Dexterity + Stealth) roll needed to launch a surprise attack from plain sight, removing the usual +2 difficulty and instead adding a number of bonus successes equal to the Exalt's Essence rating. A single activation also adds a like number of successes to the Terrestrial's Join Battle roll. If the opening attack misses, the Charm exerts an unnatural Illusion forcing all witnesses to ignore that an attack was made (and thus not Join Battle), though anyone can pay 2wp to ignore all instances of this Illusion for a scene. Although it is tradition to make surprise attacks in the midst of performing, this is not required. An identical Stealth Charm also exists named Tempest From Blue Skies Ambush that requires Stealth 4 and has Wind-Walking Technique as a prerequisite.</errText>

        <description>A truly gifted performance contains multiple layers of commu-nication, as a single turn of an actor's head or a single note artistic  ourish in a musical performance can contain nuances that only a true a cionado can appreciate. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can weave hidden subtexts and messages into his performance, ideas that only audience members of his choice can perceive. The Exalt must spend two motes per person with whom he wishes to communicate secretly, and the Charm can only be used in the course of a performance. Once the Charm is activated, he can deliver messages of almost any length, which the subject perceives subliminally, as if the Exalt were speaking in a slow monotone voice. The Charm does not permit the subject to communicate anything back to the Dragon-Blood, but if multiple Dragon-Blooded with this Charm are performing together on the same stage, they can have lengthy conversations or even arguments without the audience being any the wiser. Highly specialized or technical knowledge generally cannot be communicated with this Charm.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used only on a tick upon which the Dragon-Blood acts.</description>

        <description>A Dragon-Blooded performer can invoke a powerful response in her audience, one capable of creating a degree of emotional control or even of inflicting a compulsion on the audience. There is virtually no limitation on the degree of emotional control that the Dragon-Blooded can exert over an audience with this Charm other than the fact that individuals cannot be overwhelmed with suicidal despair. A compulsion inflicted on the audience can be anything from "only buy goods from House V'neef" to "burn down this building". The Charm cannot induce any single audience member to violate a Motivation or breach an Intimacy, however, nor can it motivate the audience to do anything particularly dangerous other than to simply riot. Triggering a riot is not something one does lightly, though, as the Dragon-Blood using this Charm has no control over the audience once the riot breaks out. Beyond these limitations, normal mortals are virtually powerless to resist the effect, but any heroic mortal in the audience might be able to resist if his MDV exceeds the Dragon-Blood's successes on a (Manipulation + Performance) roll. Exalted and spirits are immune to this Charm.
   The Dragon-Blood's player must roll (Charisma + Performance), and the difficulty is determined by the number of people in the audience - a single success is sufficient to affect a small crowd of only a few dozen, while three successes give influence over hundreds and five successes can reach thousands. The character can deliberately set out to affect only part of the audience (such as turning the poor people in the cheap seats against the patricians in the boxes), but this selectivity must be declared before the roll is made. The medium of the performance can be almost anything and does not even require the Dragon-Blood to verbally communicate with the audience. Plays, sanxian recitals, ballets or poetry readings are all equally as capable of influencing the audience's collective mood. If the roll is successful, the Dragon-Blood can either inspire a deep-seated emotion in the audience or invoke a minor compulsion.</description>

            <errText>This Charm enhances a (Manipulation + Performance) social attack, making it unblockable, unnatural influence and allowing it to be conveyed by any Performance-based action. The attack only affects mortals and may be selectively targeted to affect some observers and not others. If used to instill an Emotion, affected targets act accordingly and suffer a -2 MDV penalty for the rest of the scene against mental influence that preys on this emotional state. If used to incite action, the Compulsion is limited as described. In either case, affected characters can pay 3wp to become immune to the Charm for a scene. Ignore the roll to determine how many listeners are affected; as a performance attack, anyone who hears is potentially affected. With Essence 3+, the Charm functions against all beings with an Essence rating less or equal to the Terrestrial.</errText>

        <description>This Charm was apparently created to allow Dragon-Blooded performers to interfere with their fellows who were attempting to improperly manipulate audience members with Soul-Stirring Performance Method. The effect of the Charm combined with the artistry of the Dragon-Blood's performance enacts a potent defensive magic on the entire audience. For the duration of the performance, the difficulty to affect any member of the audience with mind-controlling Charms increases by an amount equal to the Exalt's Essence. Additionally, after the performance ends, the difficulty to use unnatural mental influence to turn any audience member against the Dragon-Blood who used the Charm increases by two. This secondary effect lasts for a number of hours equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence.</description>

        <description>It is difficult for beings as naturally ostentatious as the Dragon-Blooded to escape notice. Fortunately, some musicians are skilled enough to lull the senses of an observer as easily as a lullaby stills a child into sleep. This Charm can be activated only while the Dragon-Blood is playing a musical instrument. As long as she continues to play, those around will not notice her presence. The knowledge that someone is nearby softly playing a musical instrument tickles at the edge of the observer's consciousness, but he simply doesn't give it much thought. The player of any character who might observe the Dragon-Blood must roll (Wits + Awareness) with a difficulty of (the Dragon-Blood's Performance + instrument specialty). Even if the roll is successful, the observer might still have no reason to notice the Dragon-Blood's presence unless the presence of a musician playing an instrument is somehow out-of-place (such as a lone musician strumming his sanxian on an empty street late at night).
   In addition to a minimum of Performance 3, the Dragon-Blood must also have a specialty in some kind of musical instrument or else activate the Talented Improvisation Charm prior to beginning her performance. Also, this Charm cannot be used in connection with a particularly loud or piercing instrument. While a flute or sanxian might fade into the background, clashing cymbals or koto drums will not.</description>

        <description>Most Dragon-Blooded favor stringed instruments, and virtually all Dynasts are taught to play the sanxian as children. Essentially a three-stringed banjo, the sanxian normally requires either false fingernails or some sort of pick to play, and even the best musicians can develop pain in their fingers through extensive playing. With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can play as long as she wishes with-out pain, exhaustion or even hunger as long as she can continue to pay the daily Essence requirement. Furthermore, she no longer requires any equipment to pluck the strings of her instrument, as her fingernails lengthen and harden into suitable picks. Finally, as an added bonus, the Dragon-Blooded can further improve the strength and sharpness of her fingernails to aid in hand-to-hand attacks. By reflexively spending one mote while the Charm is active, the Dragon-Blooded can cause a single attack made with her bare hands to inflict lethal damage.</description>

            <errText>While this Charm is active, the character accumulates no fatigue from any Performance actions and ignores all internal penalties for such rolls except multiple action penalties. She can dance for a day while grievously wounded or spend a night in the embrace of her lover without breaking a sweat. The sharp beauty of well-manicured nails fittingly accompanies all art forms and therefore always applies; paying a mote to make an unarmed attack lethal does not count a Charm activation. Time spent performing while using this Charm also counts as sleep for all purposes if the performance is at the direct request or command of a Celestial Exalt.</errText>

        <description>Dragon-Blooded musicians rarely tolerate their performances being interrupted by anything so gauche as an attack by armed men. This potent Charm allows a Dragon-Blood to parry any attack with the music he creates through his instrument. Those foolish enough to attack the musician find their mightiest melee and ranged attacks turned aside by a particularly loud thrum of a sanxian's strings or a single mighty strike of a drum or gong.
   For the duration of the scene, the Dragon-Blood can replace his normal parry Ability with his Performance for purposes of calculating Parry DV. Any dots the Dragon-Blood has in an applicable Performance specialty also applies to calculating Parry DV. Finally, any Performance Excellencies the Dragon-Blood has can be used to further improve Parry DV for the duration of the scene, exactly as if they were Melee or Martial Arts Excellencies.
   In addition to a minimum of Performance 4, the Dragon-Blood must also have a specialty in some kind of musical instrument or else activate the Talented Improvisation Charm prior to beginning her performance.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick on which the Exalt is subject to an attack.</description>

        <description>A gifted musician understands his instrument in the same way that an archer understands his bow or a warrior his sword. For a Dragon-Blood who knows this Charm, this sentiment is more than a metaphor, as the Exalted musician can now launch deadly attacks armed only with a sanxian, flute or any other musical instrument. The attack is targeted with the Exalt's (Wits + Performance) and has an Accuracy bonus equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. The attack also has a range of a number of yards equal to the character's (permanent Essence x 20), and it inflicts a base damage of two levels of lethal damage per mote of Essence spent. The musician cannot spend more motes of Essence than he has dots in the Performance Ability. Although the attack is actually made of sound powered by Essence, it typically manifests in some more martial form according to the musician's will and person-ality, as well as by the potency of its damage potential. Such manifestations often appear as slashing swords, mailed fists, fiery arrows or even charging beasts, which come flying out of the Dragon-Blood's instrument hurtling toward their target. Because these manifestations have a physical component, such attacks can be parried or dodged like any normal attack, and an attack made with Three-String Sword Prana can be used in conjunction with a flurry as if it were any other form of attack. Because of the obvious nature of this Charm, it cannot be combined in any way with the Charm Blossom Hides Thorns.
   Three-String Sword Prana is also a cooperative Charm, and multiple Dragon-Blooded who know the Charm can combine their powers to form greater effects. The characters' combined Essence is used to determine the maximum range, and the Accuracy bonus of the attack is equal to the highest Essence of any participant plus two per additional participant. Also, each participant can spend Essence up to the limit of his individual Performance Ability to purchase damage dice, with all the dice purchased added together to form the base damage pool. Generally, Dragon-Blooded may use this Charm cooperatively only if the instrument used is one large enough for all participants to play simultaneously. For example, the guzheng, an oversized lap harp, is about four feet long and has 18 to 25 strings. While it is typically played by a single musician with the instrument on his lap, it is big enough for two players to play simultaneously. At the Storyteller's discretion, it might possible for a group of musicians to use this Charm cooperatively with separate instruments if they have extensive experience playing together in an ensemble (such as a gamelan orchestra or a quartet of street musicians). The maximum number of Exalted who can participate in the application of this Charm is equal to the highest Essence of any participant.</description>

        <description>They're no Lawgivers, but the Dragon-Blooded can still touch the hearts and minds of those who listen. This Charm may enhance any Charisma-based Presence or Performance social attack in which the Exalt encourages a target audience to embrace his own Motivation or a reasonable extrapolation (such as "Lead my family to greatness" becoming "help family X achieve greatness"). If any target consents to the attack without defense, her Motivation changes to the proposed Motivation and she regains full Willpower points from the newfound sense of purpose. Audiences who already share this Motivation gain only one Willpower point from the first such oratory in a scene.
   The Storyteller should consider the totality of a character's Intimacies and current situation when deciding if that character will put aside her old purpose to take up the proposed cause. This Charm has more power over a Terrestrial's direct descendents, who regard it as unnatural mental influence (albeit sincere) and must pay three Willpower points if the attack succeeds to avoid embracing the new Motivation. The Martyr effect of this Charm fully replenishes the Willpower points of all characters in earshot with a positive Intimacy toward the Exalt.</description>

        <description>The blazing elemental fury of the Dragon-Blooded is such that lesser men are humbled by their mere presence. When this Charm is activated, the Dragon-Blood is surrounded by a nimbus of Essence with the color associated with her aspect. Anyone attempting to look at the Dragon-Blood or to make a melee attack against her must score at least one success on a reflexive Willpower check. Even if that roll is successful, any attack made on the Dragon-Blooded before his next action suffers a dice penalty equal to the Dragon-Blood's Presence. This effect lasts until the Dragon-Blood's next action. The Charm affects only those individuals within yards a number of yards equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence, and it doesn't impair ranged attacks.</description>

Characters who pay 2wp (4wp if a descendant) become immune all use of this Charm by the Terrestrial for the scene, ignoring its unnatural mental influence.

        <description>Most Dragon-Blooded consider their personal honor to be sacrosanct, and to such social and self-important creatures, a Charm such as this one is a terrible weapon. The Dragon-Blood need only gain her target's attention and insult or embarrass him in some way to cause the target to become irrationally fixated on her. The Dragon-Blood's player must roll (Manipulation + Presence), adding her Essence in automatic successes. The results are compared to the target's MDV. In combat, only the target's Dodge MDV is applicable, and an affected target suffers a -1 penalty to both DDV and PDV when  fighting anyone other than the Exalt who used this Charm against him. Outside of combat, the Charm can also be used simply to undermine a rival's social position. The Exalt's player must roll (Manipulation + Presence) against the target as a social attack roll, and only the target's Parry MDV is applicable. If the Exalt is successful, the target suffers grave embarrassment from whatever cutting remark she made, and he suffers a -2 penalty to all social rolls for the remainder of the Charm's duration. The Charm lasts for a number of actions equal to the Exalt's Essence during combat or for a number of long ticks equal to the Exalt's Essence in social combat.</description>

        <description>Cunning Dragon-Blooded often use this Charm to draw their enemies into traps or simply to lure them away from overmatched allies. The target of this Charm becomes fixated on engaging the Dragon-Blood in hand-to-hand combat. The Exalt's player must roll (Manipulation + Presence), comparing successes to the target's Dodge MDV. Parry MDV is not applicable to this Charm. The Dragon-Blood must be within 10 yards of the target, who must have a lower Essence than the Exalt. Once the Charm is activated, the target can take no action other than to approach the Exalt at her normal Speed and attack him if she is able to do so. The target cannot be compelled to approach through obviously suicidal means (attempting to run through flowing lava to get at the Exalt, for example), but she is willing to cross dangerous hazards such as fires or raging rivers to reach the object of her ire.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the peerless self-con dence of the Princes of the Earth can be backed up with pure physicality, as the Dragon-Blood's natural charisma physically bolsters his body. For the duration of the Charm, the Dragon-Blood gains +1 bashing and lethal soak and three temporary -0 health levels. The extra health levels are the first to be lost when the character suffers damage, and once lost, they cannot be healed back, even with Charms that permit instantaneous healing. At the end of the scene, the extra health levels fade automatically, even if they have not been used up. A character cannot benefit from this Charm more than once per scene.</description>

        <description>When little children in the Realm ask their parents what thunder is, the parents often say that it's the sound of the Elemental Dragons roaring down from Heaven to frighten away evil spirits. This Charm invokes the awesome power of the Dragons by letting a Terrestrial Exalt yell with the force of an angry god. The roar focuses the Exalt's elemental power on a man-sized target, which must be within a number of feet equal to the Exalt's (permanent Essence x 20).
   The precise effect differs depending on the aspect of the Dragon-Blood. Air shatters glass and deafens living creatures for the remainder of the scene. Earth can blast a man-sized hole in a stone wall or explode the ground beneath the target's feet, inflicting four levels of bashing damage (which can be soaked). Fire can ignite flammable objects, and while the yell cannot damage flesh directly, if the target's clothing catches fire, she suffers two levels of lethal damage every action until she puts the flames out. Water will drench the target with enough water to douse a campfire, and the player of a living target hit by the yell must successfully roll (Strength + Athletics) at difficulty 4 to keep her character from being knocked prone by the force of the blow. Finally, Wood can shatter a wooden door completely or, if used against a living target, splinter any wooden bows, arrows or other weapons the target carries.
   This Charm is actually a cluster of Charms, one for each of the five elements. A Dragon-Blood can learn multiple versions of this Charm, but he must learn the one associated with his aspect element first. Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, this Charm is always considered to be a Fire-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies.</description>

            <errText>To use this Charm, make an unblockable attack roll of Appearance + Presence + Breeding; the attack's range is (Essence x 6) yards. The target cannot be larger than (Essence x 2) yards in any dimension. A successful hit causes the following effects as appropriate:
   Air: All non-magical glass within a yard of the target shatters and the target suffers one level of unsoakable bashing damage; the target loses its sense of hearing for a scene as a Crippling effect.
   Earth: The pulverizing vocalization destroys a non-magical inanimate target or comparably-sized segment of a larger structure that is made of earth, clay, stone, etc. Other targets suffer 4B from the explosion of the ground beneath them.
   Fire: Ignites everything readily flammable within a yard of the target as an environmental hazard with Damage 2L/action, Trauma 3. Non-flammable objects suffer no damage upfront, but may be burned by the non-magical fires the Charm sets.
   Water: The roar extinguishes any volume of non-magical fire it can target and knocks targeted beings prone.
   Wood: As Air above, but shattering non-magical wood instead of glass.
   A Terrestrial with Essence 5+ can pay an extra +1wp when activating the Charm to unleash an area attack against every valid target in range.</errText>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood's innate majesty is now sufficient to win almost anyone's loyalty, at least temporarily. The Exalt can spend eight motes and one Willpower to attempt to win the loyalty of a Storyteller character. The Exalt's player must roll (Manipulation + Presence), applying the target's MDV. The target of this Charm develops a loyalty toward the Dragon-Blood for a period of one week per net success, during which time the target is at -1 to her MDV to resist social attacks made by the Exalt. Furthermore, if the Dragon-Blood makes a point of asking only trivial or minor tasks from the target and makes a show of valuing the target's loyalty, the effect lasts for one month per success. Finally, if the Dragon-Blood's player achieves five or more successes, the affected character becomes a new henchman for the Exalted character (per the Background).
   This Charm can be used against only mortals and other Terrestrial Exalted. It automatically fails against Celestial Exalted and spirits.</description>

The roll for the Charm's unnatural social attack is (Appearance + Presence + Breeding). If the attack succeeds, the target must pay 2wp (4wp if a descendant) or gain an Intimacy of loyalty to the Exalt. This Intimacy resists removal for a number of weeks equal to the remaining successes after applying MDV, during which time it reasserts itself completely whenever the target gets a roll to regain Willpower from sleep. Good treatment extends the duration of enchantment as stated in the Charm. With 5+ remaining successes, a character made loyal by the Charm serves as faithfully as a henchman (per the Background) while bearing an enchanted Intimacy.</errText>

        <description>This Charm can be used on a target only once, when the Dragon-Blood and the target first meet in a non-combat, social situation. During this initial encounter, the Dragon-Blood can read the subject perfectly, intuitively adjusting his behavior so as to make the best possible first impression. The target will be generally be open to the Exalt and will leave the encounter with a favorable impression of him. Even if the two never meet again, the target of the Charm will generally speak well of the Dragon-Blood to others regarding his obvious good breeding and superior virtue. Mechanically, the Dragon-Blood's player gains two extra dice to roll on every Bureaucracy, Presence or Socialize roll during this first encounter and one extra die on the second encounter, if any. The Dragon-Blood may also gain indirect insights about the target's loyalties, Virtues and Motivations, as the Storyteller will warn the player ahead of time that an intended action or statement may affect the target's MDV (whether positively or negatively).
   This Charm can be used only in non-combat and non-threatening social settings where a pleasant first impression can realistically be made. Consequently, it is unlikely that this Charm can ever be used effectively on a battlefield, though it might be useful in peace talks with a hateful enemy or when entering a rough tavern in a bad part of town. If the Dragon-Blood deliberately antagonizes the subject in any way, the effect ends.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It cannot be used in physical combat, but can be invoked during any long tick of social combat.</description>

            <errText>While active, this Charm confers a +3 specialty "Exclusively against (target character name)" that applies to all social actions using any Ability during social combat. This counts as a natural specialty rather than a Charm bonus for the purpose of adding dice with other Charms, but the character still cannot apply more than +3 among all specialties. Simultaneous activations can target different characters. Cumulatively reduce the Charm's specialty by -1 per prior scene of social combat in which the Exalt and the target both participated. Each additional purchase of this Charm allows the Terrestrial to select one of the following conditions that "resets" the bonus: consensual sex with the target, not interacting with the target for a season, completing a task directly requested by the target that takes a scene or longer to accomplish.</errText>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood can transmute one strong passion (lust, rage or terror) into one of the other two. She must first engage her target in conversation for a number of long ticks equal to 10 - her Essence, then her player rolls (Manipulation + Presence) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence, minus one for every point by which the Dragon-Blood's Essence exceeds the target's. If successful, the Dragon-Blood's player gains two dice on all subsequent social attack rolls against the target designed to play off the target's new emotional state. Also, a target who has been affected by this Charm acts as if his Temperance Virtue had been reduced to 1 for the duration of the scene.</description>

            <errText>This Charm cannot be a character's first action in social combat (replacing the requirement of ticks spent conversing). The Charm's unnatural social attack uses a dice pool of (Manipulation + Presence + Essence); if it beats the target's MDV, the desired emotion burns in her heart for a scene (also reducing her Temperance to 1 unless that is her primary Virtue). Feelings conferred by the Charm provide the same social combat benefits and drawbacks as a high-rated Virtue. Paying 1wp at any point frees a character from this Charm.</errText>

        <description>Although they are descended from human stock, the Dragon-Blooded are not human, and interbreeding with their inferiors sullies their blood. Terrestrials developed this Charm to cull the unworthy and elevate those who aspire to greatness beyond their parent's shame.
       Purity Crucible Strike can enhance any Melee or Martial Arts attack. Although it is traditionally delivered without mercy at the conclusion of an elaborate hazing ceremony, a pulled blow suffices as long as the attack hits. Mortals struck by the attack die instantly, their blood burnt to ash in the fires of judgment. Non-human beings suffer no effects, having no humanity to scorch, nor do Celestial Exalted or Breeding 5 Dragon-Blooded whose purity is beyond reproach. (The Charm also has no effect on Terrestrials whose Essence is higher than that of the user). The player of a Dragon-Blooded target whose Breeding is less than 5 must make an (Essence + Breeding) roll at difficulty (Breeding + 1). Stunts enhancing this roll must recall prior conduct proving the Exalt's worth as a Dragon-Blood. Failure results in death. Success raises the target's Breeding by one dot as a Training effect costing three experience points (maximum Breeding 5). Exalted with Breeding 4 or less may learn this Charm, but may target only themselves with penitent self-mutilation until they refine their lineage to Breeding 5.</description>

        <description>Like the element they emulate, the Children of Pasiap are pillars of strength and endurance. The Dragon-Blood must meditate for a moment while holding and contemplating some piece of earth as small as a pebble. Thereafter, he can add one dot each to his Strength and Stamina for the remainder of the scene. He can also grant one dot in Strength and Stamina to a number of additional people equal to his Essence, at a cost of two additional motes per person. To do so, all persons affected must hold hands with a pebble clasped in each pair of hands. An individual can benefit from this Charm only once per scene.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Exalt can call upon the quiet strength of mighty mountains to augment his physical power. For one ac-tion, the Dragon-Blood's Strength increases by five, but only for the purpose of lifting or handling stone or earthen objects, such as toppling pillars, hurling boulders or stomping on the top of a hill to start a landslide. Also, for the purposes of this Charm, jade-alloyed weapons such as daiklaves are considered to be stone, and the Strength bonus does apply to attacks made with such weapons. This Charm is explicitly allowed to be put into Combos with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>This is actually a cluster of five separate Charms. When this Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood's skin changes color to match that of whatever form of jade is associated with the element invoked. The character gets a bonus to his lethal and bashing soak equal to his Essence against elemental damage and attacks and an equal bonus to his (Stamina + Resistance) pool when resisting damaging environmental effects, provided that the character has purchased and activated the appropriate Charm for that element.
   Air improves the Exalt's soak versus both Archery and Thrown attacks, attacks by any blue jade weapons and Air-based elemental attacks. Also, the Dragon-Blood's Essence is added to his (Stamina + Resistance) pool when resisting extremes of cold. Earth grants a soak bonus against Melee and Martial Arts attacks using metal weapons or any attacks with white jade weapons, as well as Earth-based elemental attacks. This soak bonus also applies to indirect damage from stone and dirt such as rockslides or simply falling to the ground from a great height, and the Exalt adds his Essence to his (Stamina + Resistance) pool to resist asphyxiation if he is buried alive. Fire improves the Exalt's soak versus firewands and other fire-based attacks, as well as red jade weapons. The Dragon-Blood adds his Essence to his (Stamina + Resistance) pool when resisting extremes of heat. Water improves the Exalt's soak versus Water-based elemental attacks and any black jade weapons, as well as all attacks directed against him when he is fully immersed in water. If the Dragon-Blood cannot breathe underwater, this Charm will allow him to add his Essence to any (Stamina + Resistance) roll to hold his breath. Finally, Wood grants a soak bonus against Melee and Martial Arts attacks that use wooden weapons, any attacks using green jade weapons, "natural" attacks such as fists, kicks and teeth, and Wood-based elemental attacks. The Dragon-Blood can also add his Essence to his (Stamina + Resistance) when exposed to any poison or disease that might affect him.
   The soak bonus granted by this Charm does not apply to attacks enhanced by Charms or sorcery of Celestial level or higher, but it is applicable to elementally aspected Charms such as Elemental Bolt Attack. Also, the soak benefits do not apply against artifact weapons made from magical materials other than whatever form of jade is associated with the element used in the Charm deployed. Normally, the Essence cost is three motes, but when an Exalt is using the version associated with the element of his own Aspect, the cost is only two motes. Stacking multiple versions of this Charm will not increase the soak bonus or the (Stamina + Resistance) bonus, but it will make certain the bonus applies to multiple hazards. This Charm does stack with Impervious Skin of Stone Meditation and is compatible with armor.
   Unlike many elemental Charms, a Dragon-Blood can purchase more than one version of this Charm, and he is not required to purchase the version for the element to which he is aligned first. Indeed, most Dragon-Blooded do not, since they already gain some of these benefits through their elemental animas. Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be an Earth-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies.</description>

            <description>Elemental Essence surges across the Dragon-Blood's skin, hardening his flesh into living jade. (Element) Protection Form is actually a cluster of Charms, one per element. A Dragon-Blood must learn the version appropriate to his aspect before learning others. Activating any version of this Charm adds (Essence + Resistance + Breeding) to the Dragon-Blood's bashing and lethal soak against a single attack. Against attacks and environmental hazards that resonate with the chosen element, it also subtracts one die from their post-soak damage, to a minimum of one die.
   Air: Air Protection Form protects against ranged attacks, or any attack or hazard that uses wind, cold, or electricity.
   Earth: Earth Protection Form protects against attacks made with metal or stone weapons (including jade, but not any of the other magical materials), or any attack or hazard that uses stone or dirt, such as a landslide.
   Fire: Fire Protection Form protects against attacks and hazards that use fire or extremes of heat, such as an inferno or firewand.
   Water: Water Protection Form protects against any attack made against the Dragon-Blood while he is submerged in water, or against any attack or hazard that uses water.
   Wood: Wood Protection Form protects against any attack made with a wooden weapon or natural attack, or against any attack or hazard that uses plant or animal life, such as a magically conjured swarm of bees.</description>

While this Charm is active, the Dragon-Blood does not require food or water and suffers no ill effects from hunger or thirst.

For the rest of the scene after the invocation of this Charm, the Dragon-Blood does not breathe. He can survive underwater, in clouds of poisonous gas or volcanic ash or even in supernaturally created voids. Yet, while the Charm is in effect, he not only does not need to breathe, he cannot breathe. Consequently, speech is impossible for the duration of the Charm. The Exalt can extend the effects of this Charm to other people by touching them and spending two additional motes of Essence per person. A target must be willing, however, or the Charm does not affect him.</description>

        <description>The ultimate expression of the Earth Aspect's relationship with his aligned element, this Charm permits the Dragon-Blood to shrug off the mightiest blows as if the attacker had simply swung his sword at a mountain. For the duration of a scene, the Dragon-Blood who invokes this Charm can ignore all wound penalties. The Charm does nothing to mitigate the damage actually suffered. It merely allows the Exalt to ignore the symptoms of injury.
   This is a reflexive Charm which can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick.</description>

        <description>Gaia herself is not the world, but her power and souls flow and pool through Creation as its living Essence, and the world loves its mother. Partaking of this love, an elder Dragon-Blood and his personal possessions cannot suffer damage or other negative physical conditions except those caused by the following: environments/substances from outside Creation, intentional actions of beings with Essence 4+, powers of artifacts/hearthstones rated 4+, anything outside fate, or any other source the Storyteller deems sufficiently alien or powerful enough to circumvent the scope of this protection. If the character knows Unfeeling Earth Meditation (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 148), he also ignores all forms and effects of deprivation and internal distress for the duration, including hunger, thirst, exhaustion, suffocation and pain. The Martyr usage of this Charm forestalls the Exalt's death until the end of the scene, until which he cannot suffer any damage but gains no protection from other negative effects. Exalted with Resistance 7, Essence 7 may purchase this Charm again to extend its duration to Indefinite. A third purchase at Resistance 8, Essence 8 reduces the cost to one mote.
   The distant love of the Emerald Mother for her grandchildren is of limited efficacy in the face of the Exalted. Rather than being immune to physical harm from such characters, the Dragon-Blood instead enjoys +15B/+15L natural soak, Hardness 10B/10L, and (Essence / 2) automatic successes on all rolls to resist Poison effects and environmental damage originating with such Exalts.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Exalted rider forges a bond with his mount, fortifying and strengthening it with Essence. Until the Dragon-Blood's next action, he can add his Ride rating in yards to his mount's movement rate and also add that amount to the distance the mount can safely jump. Also, during that time, the rider gains a +2 bonus on all Ride-related dice pools, and his Ride is considered to be one dot higher for purposes of limiting his dice pools on other actions taken while on horseback.

        <description>Those Exalted trained in mounted combat enjoy a great advantage on the battlefield due to their mounts' superior height and mobility. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood becomes more efficient at employing the advantages of mounted combat. After his player successfully makes a reflexive (Dexterity + Ride) roll, the Dragon-Blood can add his Ride Ability to his damage dice in hand-to-hand attacks made while mounted. This Charm can explicitly be included in Combos with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>This Charm represents perhaps the most common Dragon-Blooded magical cavalry tactic still in widespread use. Although its value cannot be denied, it is only a pale shadow of the many Charms defined by The Thousand Correct Actions of the Upright Soldier. The Dragon-Blood must pay one Willpower plus one mote per horse and rider affected, including the Dragon-Blood herself. For the duration of a single charge, the Join Battle roll made for the Dragon-Blood who initiates the Charm applies to every rider in the formation, and the attacks of any of the riders are automatically resolved before any delayed attack actions on the part of the defenders. Furthermore, the player of any defender who suffers any damage must make an immediate Ride or Athletics roll to keep his character from being unhorsed or knocked down. The Dragon-Blood must ride with the charging allies, who cannot number more than (his permanent Essence x 5).
   If used in Mass Combat, the cost is five motes per point of Magnitude in the Dragon-Blood's force, and the Charm cannot be used to enhance any unit with a Magnitude higher than 2. Instead of the effects described above, the Charm increases the unit's Drill and Might by one each for the duration of the charge, as well as the cavalry unit's Morale. If the defending force is required to make a rout check, the difficulty of that check also increases by one (see "Mass Combat" in Exalted, starting on p. 158).</description>

            <errText>Any special character in a complementary unit can use this Charm to enhance it, but a unit can only benefit from one activation at a time. A unit so enhanced gains the listed bonuses while it is carrying out successive charge actions (i.e. dashes) and loses no Endurance from doing so. Once the unit stops charging or makes a close combat attack, the Charm ends. If aborted by making an attack, all benefits last through the resolution of that attack and the Terrestrial's Ebony Spur Technique becomes Stackable for that attack to a maximum number of activations equal to the actions spent charging (or the charging character's Essence rating, if lower). Disregard the Charm's printed rules for personal combat. Instead, this Charm allows successive mounted dashes to build up the potential for Stackable activations of Ebony Spur Technique as explained above. This benefit can be extended to any mounted characters who know Ebony Spur Technique within 100 yards who are also dashing at the time of activation, allowing them to build up separate momentum.</errText>

        <description>This variation of Charge of One Hundred Generals can be used only for mass combat maneuvers. The Charm lets the Dragon-Blood temporarily boost the effectiveness of large groups of mounted cavalry. The Dragon-Blood must spend one Willpower plus three motes for each point of Magnitude the cavalry unit possesses. Beginning with the first action of actual combat and lasting for a number of long ticks equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence, the Dragon-Blood's (Ride + Essence) is added to the unit's Join Battle roll, and his ([Ride + Essence] / 3) is added to the unit's Close Combat Attack rating. This Charm can be used only during an actual charge and cannot be initiated once combat actually begins. The Dragon-Blood must be a part of the cavalry unit (although he does not have to be the leader), and a unit can benefit from only one use of this Charm at a time.</description>

        <description>Typically, when a Dragon-Blood rides out to battle, she has quite enough to worry about without fearing that her steed will get spooked by whatever horror demands the Exalt's attention and throw the rider at an inopportune moment. This Charm can prevent such an ignoble possibility by bolstering the creature's natural bravery with Essence so that the mount truly becomes one with its rider. For the duration of the scene, the mount will not bolt or flee no matter what danger manifests, unless it is told to do so by its rider. Also, the mount will always act as if it is perfectly trained, regardless of the situation, and the Dragon-Blood will never suffer any penalty for trying to perform some action while maintaining control of the mount. Finally, while the Charm remains in effect, nothing can force the rider from her saddle short of the steed itself being killed out from under her. While a failed or botched Ride check might result in the rider losing an action or some other penalty, she will never be thrown, knocked or pulled from her saddle. The effect lasts for one scene or until the rider voluntarily dismounts.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used on any tick.</description>

        <description>The baleful effects of the Dragon-Blooded anima banners usually preclude the use of horses in combat situations. This Charm can ameliorate those effects, ensuring that the Dragon-Blood does not face the specter of accidentally slaying his own mount in the midst of pitched battle. The Dragon-Blood spends three motes while mounted, and for the duration of the scene, the mount takes no damage from his anima flux.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the unity between rider and mount is perfected. Now, instead of simply protecting her mount from the damaging effects of her anima power, the Dragon-Blood can extend the power of that anima to the mount itself. For the duration of the scene, the Dragon-Blood's horse gains an elemental anima appropriate to the Dragon-Blood's aspect, giving it special abilities. The mounts of Air Aspects are immune to cold and multiply their jumping distances by an amount equal to the rider's Essence. The mounts of Earth Aspects gain a bonus to bashing and lethal soak equal to the rider's Essence, and a mount can also soak lethal damage with its full Stamina. The mounts of Fire Aspects multiply their movement rate by the rider's Essence and leave  aming hoof prints behind them that are capable of starting small brush res. The mounts of Water Aspects gain complete freedom of movement in or on water, exactly like the Water Aspect anima power. Finally, the mounts of Wood can move through wooded areas without suffering any penalty or decrease in movement rate, and a mount's tracks will be untraceable absent the use of Charms. The normal cost of this Charm is 10 motes and one Willpower. If the mount to be protected is a familiar to the Dragon-Blood, the cost decreases to six motes and one Willpower, and the Dragon-Blood can choose to commit the Essence to make the Charm's effect last until he ends the commitment.
       Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, this Charm is always considered to be a Wood-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies, and a Dragon-Blood can learn only the version associated with his own aspect.</description>

            <errText>This Charm is actually a cluster of five Charms. Dragon-Blooded must learn the version associated with their aspect first. A Ride vehicle is also a valid target, in which case the Air power adds the Exalt's Essence rating to its Maneuverability in addition to cold immunity. Once a Terrestrial has enchanted a target with one version of this Charm, the cost to apply other any other versions drops to 1m. With Essence 4+, the character can commit an additional mote per valid target within 500 yards, extending the Charm's benefits to that target as long as it stays within range.</errText>

        <description>Despite the Wood Aspect's natural skill at horsemanship, it is very difficult for even the most able Dragon-Blooded rider to master an animal much bigger than a normal horse. Indeed, while a Dragon-Blood can attempt to master larger animals for brief periods of time, the only way to truly break such a beast and casually ride it as one would a horse is through this Charm. The Dragon-Blood's player must roll (Charisma + Ride), opposed by the beast's (Stamina + Willpower). The Dragon-Blood must also roleplay "breaking" the mount, which in the case of very dangerous animals or flying creatures can be quite dangerous if the attempt fails. If the attempt succeeds, the Dragon-Blood (and only the Dragon-Blood) can command the creature and use it as a mount, suffering no penalties on attempts to ride the creature. Generally, a tyrant lizard is probably the largest animal that can be mastered with this Charm, although the Storyteller may permit even larger beasts to be tamed at his discretion and with suitable penalties applied to the taming roll. A creature tamed by this Charm can be subjected to Elemental Halo's Mercy and Five-Dragon Horseman Prana, but the cost for activating those Charms increases by five motes.</description>

            <errText>If the activation roll succeeds, the Exalt spends a scene subduing the target animal, after which the benefits of Great Heart Companion automatically apply while riding it and the steed gains an Intimacy of loyalty toward the Terrestrial, doing all within the limits of its bestial intelligence to obey and please her. If the Exalt mistreats the mount, the effect only lasts a month; it is otherwise permanent. On a failed roll, the training scene goes very poorly and the Exalt suffers unsoakable levels of lethal damage equal to the net successes by which the mount won. Ignore the listed surcharge to apply other Ride Charms to large mounts. A Terrestrial can use this Charm to break a mount for a Celestial Exalt, in which case the animal transfers its loyalty as soon as it meets its owner.</errText>

        <description>Infusing her mount or vehicle with living Essence, the Exalt provides a sustaining force of wholeness. While blessed by this Charm, a living steed is considered to have engaged in half the strenuous activity it actually has from the standpoint of becoming fatigued. Likewise, Ride vehicles consider the hour of operation as half an hour for the purposes of accruing Maintenance upkeep.</description>

        <description>Although mortal beasts make perfectly fine steeds for young Terrestrials with the right Charms, they do not properly complement the greatness of elders. To gain this Charm's benefits, the Exalt must sacrifice a mount with whom he has built a mutual Intimacy of loving affection. The Elemental Dragon answers this prayer by interceding with Gaia, who shapes the dead animal's remains into a completely new creature with the same traits as the sacrifice. This animal has none of the memories or identity of the sacrifice and looks different, with elemental markings appropriate to its owner's aspect. It is considered a five-dot familiar with all the powers of such and also possesses permanent enchantments duplicating the effects of the Charms Great Heart Companion, Elemental Halo's Mercy and Five-Dragon Horseman Prana (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, pp. 181-182). This mount will not accept riders other than its owner unless it is supernaturally compelled. It dies when its master does. Should the mount perish sooner, its owner may petition for a replacement with a new sacrifice, but the Dragons ignore those who abuse Gaia's gifts.</description>

        <description>With a glance toward the western sky and a quick whiff of the sea salt in the air, the Dragon-Blood can flawlessly predict the course of the weather for the day by intuitively sensing the currents of the ocean and the air. The Charm will not help the Dragon-Blood predict supernatural changes to the weather made after her prediction. It can, however, sometimes predict phenomena related in some way to the weather or to the seas, such as deducing when an enemy fleet is most likely to leave port by knowing the tidal patterns or predicting an earthquake by foreseeing the tsunami it will cause. In order to use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must be on water. It automatically fails when she is standing on land.</description>

For the duration of a scene, the Dragon-Blood can double his ship's rate of movement. While not a long-term aid to travel, this Charm can make sure that one ship beats another into port or that the ship can outrun bad weather or pirates. If the ship is forced to take a path through dangerous waters at its accelerated speed, Sail rolls may be required to maintain control of the ship and keep it from running aground. This Charm has absolutely no effect if the ship is totally becalmed. It can double the current speed of a ship, but it cannot cause a ship to move without any wind or current at all.</description>

        <description>Being one with the ocean also attunes the Dragon-Blood to what lies beneath it. For the duration of a scene, the Dragon-Blood intuitively knows of any submerged hazards within five miles of her current location (assuming she is at sea, of course), effectively adding three dice to any Sail rolls that involve navigating through such hazards. The Charm does not automatically protect the ship from harm. A bad roll by the player might still cause the ship to be ripped asunder. Also, the Charm only gives an awareness of submerged static hazards. It gives no insight into the actions of the band of pirates preparing an ambush, the oncoming Resplendent Dolphin Undersea Courier full of Anathema or the hungry aquatic behemoth approaching from the depths.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely with-out the need for a Combo. If used during combat, it can only be activated on a tick upon which the Dragon-Blood acts but not on any of the intervening ticks that come between them. In mass combat, it can be used on any long tick.</description>

        <description>While Fine Passage Negotiating Style can warn an attentive Dragon-Blood of approaching hazards capable of tearing the ship asunder, such hazards are not always avoidable. At such times, Dragon-Blooded at sea are grateful for this Charm, which can augment the integrity of a ship's hull without reducing the ship's speed. When a character uses this Charm on a ship, its hull gains three additional health levels and two additional soak. The Charm lasts for a scene or until the Dragon-Blood leaves the vessel.</description>

            <errText>This Charm adds Undamaged health levels. When these levels are gained or vanish with the Charm's deactivation, reapply the vehicle's current damage to its new health track. The soak bonus adds directly to bashing and lethal armor. Use of this Charm by separate Dragon-Blooded to enhance the same vehicle is permissible, but a character cannot use the Charm if the total number of extant activations exceeds his Sail rating. Any Sail vehicle is a valid target of this Charm.</errText>

        <description>A ship can be hazardous terrain even in the calmest of seas, as sailors constantly risk falling from the rigging, slipping on a wet deck or getting knocked overboard during rough seas. This Charm can negate such risks for both the Exalt and his crewmates. While this Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood can make any normal movements across the deck of a ship or up and down its rigging without any possibility of falling, even in the roughest seas or while the ship is under attack. The Charm also totally negates any movement penalties associated with environmental effects such as ice, snow, water or motion.
   This Charm does not normally permit the sailor to perform impossible feats such as walking along the side of a ship's hull or up the canvas of its billowing sails. However, if the Dragon-Blood has Sail 5 and spends six motes instead of three, even these limits are overcome, allowing him to perform impossible feats such as standing horizontally on the ship's mast or upside down from the bottom of its crow's nest. The sole limitation is that this Charm can be used only aboard a ship of some sort, although exotic vessels such as Haslanti air boats count as ships. In addition to granting the aforementioned benefits of either version to himself, the Dragon-Blood can also grant them to anyone else provided he pays the same amount of Essence and touches the person to be affected.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. The Dragon-Blood can use it on himself on any tick. If he wishes to use it on someone else, he can do so only by touching the other person on a tick upon which he acts.</description>

        <description>The Dragons demand service from the ships aboard which they serve. Upon activating this Charm aboard a Sail vehicle, the Dragon-Blood falls into a deep trance and his eyes glaze over. His awareness becomes diffused throughout the vessel, allowing him to notice events as though he were present at every point in the vehicle. More importantly, the Exalt can use his actions to mentally control any part of the vehicle that standard crew could operate, such as piloting, unfurling sails, manning weapons emplacements and so on. If the vehicle is owned and captained by a Celestial Exalt, she and the Terrestrial can telepathically communicate with one another, as long as they share a language and the captain doesn't travel more than a mile from her ship.
   Up to five Terrestrials can use this Charm cooperatively, in which case they know each other's surface thoughts so that they can efficiently divide labor, may reflexively donate motes to one another at will and provide each other limited cooperation bonuses on all crew-related tasks. A single user of this Charm can control a non-magical craft or one rated Artifact 1; each additional Cooperative participant raises the Artifact rating that the group can collectively manage. Use of this Charm does not obviate the need for crew, it just allows Terrestrials to be wherever they are most needed.</description>

        <description>Speeding a ship for a quick burst has its uses, but most journeys are long-term endeavors. Once the Dragon-Blood activates this Charm onboard a vessel, his anima releases a pulse of liquid energy that enfolds the contours of the ship in a bubble extending five yards from the hull. This energy gently drags the vessel beneath the waves while allowing it and everyone aboard to operate as if protected by a Water Aspect anima. While so submerged, the ship moves at twice its normal speed and may take full advantage of its three-dimensional environment through normal propulsion (using currents instead of wind to fill sails). Crew unwise enough to leave the safety of the bubble had better hope they are close enough to the surface to reach air before they drown. If the Exalt dies or fails to renew the Charm each day, the protection ends, serving as a considerable deterrent to mutiny. This Charm can enchant a skyship, allowing it to fly through the ocean with the aforementioned benefits.</description>

        <description>Overbold critics of Dragon-Blooded culture often complain that too many Dynasts are nothing but orgiastic dilettantes. Even when this is an accurate description of particular Dragon-Blood, however, one cannot deny that such individuals are supremely gifted hosts. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood spends the requisite Essence and instantly improves the quality, strength and taste of any nearby quantity of alcohol. Aside from the Epicurean advantages of this Charm, if the affected wine is drunk, the difficulty of any Socialize rolls made against the drinkers decreases by one for the scene.
   Unfortunately, there is a downside. If any of the drinkers present botches a Socialize roll, the result will almost certainly be some degree of personal embarrassment, from a drunken brawl to an ill-advised seduction attempt.</description>

            <errText>This Charm enchants a particular social event attended by no more than (Socialize rating) Magnitude individuals. Anyone at the event who consumes alcohol or any other recreational intoxicant finds the experience far more pleasurable than normal and suffers a penalty of -1 to MDV for the scene from lowered inhibitions. If any social attack botches against an intoxicated individual, she is deeply offended and must pay 1wp not to Join Battle against the attacker with her next action as an unnatural Compulsion. This Charm may be repurchased multiple times to enchant different social pleasures, including having sex, participating in/being an active spectator to violence (such as duels or fight clubs), and anything else the Storyteller approves. Those who indulge in the chosen vice are affected as above. Different versions of the Charm stack, but only one use of each version can enchant the same event.</errText>

        <description>Regardless of the Dragon-Blood's precise background, he will typically have seen more debauchery and spectacle than most mortals could imagine, often even before his actual Exaltation. As a result, most Dragon-Blooded can be quite blasé about social interactions. With this Charm, the Exalted can hone this sense of ennui and boredom into a potent defense against mental and social manipulation. When this Charm is activated, the Dragon-Blood can add half his Socialize rating (rounded up) to the difficulty of any Charisma, Manipulation and Socialize rolls made by others attempting to manipulate him with either natural or unnatural mental influence. This includes attempts to use other Socialize Charms to compel the Dragon-Blood's response. The Dragon-Blood's Essence is also considered to be one higher than it really is for the purpose of comparing his Essence to other beings using Charms that do not affect individuals with a higher Essence than the one using the Charm.</description>

        <description>The wise Exalt remains constantly aware of the ebb and flow of the social dynamics that surround her. Therefore, she is prepared when a genteel social encounter suddenly turns into a violent confrontation. During an unexpected combat situation (i.e., an unexpectedly violent situation that explodes out of an initially nonviolent interaction), the character who activates this Charm can add three dice to her Join Battle roll and gains a +1 DV bonus for the first three actions of combat.
   This is a reflexive Charm which can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick.</description>

        <description>A great many Dragon-Bloods, particularly among the Dynasts, are skilled at casually destroying deep and abiding relationships connecting other people. Often, such manipulations are done for fun as well as for pro t. In order to activate this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must be in the same immediate area as his chosen target and whichever person he wishes to turn the target against. Once the Charm is activated, the Exalt need only make some comment to one individual about the other - perhaps snidely, perhaps with the most persuasive sincerity - calculated to make the listener doubt the intentions or loyalty of the other person. Augmented by Essence and Willpower, this single comment is sufficient to weaken the bonds of friendship between the listener and the other person. Exactly how this plays out is largely a matter of Storyteller discretion, but it should be fairly easy for the Dragon-Blood to provoke harsh words between the two or perhaps even a  fight.
   The Exalt's player must roll (Manipulation + Socialize), adding the Dragon-Blood's Essence in automatic successes. Only Dodge MDV is applicable to this social attack. Even one success is enough to stir up feelings of resentment in the target against his erstwhile friend. Three or more will almost certainly move the target to violence.
   The effects of this Charm last for a scene, after which cooler heads prevail and the two characters' normal feelings reassert themselves, assuming of course that nothing has happened in the meantime to permanently sever those feelings. Neither party immediately remembers the role the Dragon-Blood initially played in starting the disagreement, but the character who was the original target might recall the Exalt's well-timed turn of phrase if his player makes a successful (Intelligence + Socialize) roll with a difficulty equal to the Dragon-Blood's Manipulation. This Charm is well known in both the Realm and in Lookshy, where its abuse can lead to social censure and possibly even the filing of criminal charges.
   This Charm automatically fails when used against a being with a higher Essence than the Dragon-Blood. It also automatically fails when used to attempt to turn a Dragon-Blood against another member of her sworn brotherhood.</description>

            <errText>The roll for the Charm's unblockable unnatural social attack is (Manipulation + Presence), adding a number of bonus successes equal to the Exalt's Socialize. If successful, the target instantly gains a negative Intimacy toward the badmouthed person with an emotional context appropriate to the Terrestrial's allegations. If the target has an existing positive Intimacy toward the subject of the Dragon-Blood's ire, success converts that connection to a negative emotional context. Resisting the creation of a new Intimacy costs 2wp. Preventing a positive Intimacy from becoming tainted is easier, requiring only 1wp. Those who fail the roll to remember the Exalt's involvement later on may pay 3wp to recall the truth, shattering the Charm's unnatural Illusion.</errText>

This Charm can be used only during a seduction attempt, but in such situations, the Dragon-Blood can increase her Socialize Ability by five or double its normal rating, whichever is less.

        <description>It is a rare individual who can make an enemy of someone and then blithely sit down with him as a friend. Those Fire Aspects who know this Charm can be counted among that rare breed. The Exalt using this Charm can cause a target to temporarily "forget" a single past event involving him that would reflect poorly on the current discussion. In other words, the Exalt can cause the target to forget a single past encounter for the duration of the current scene, whether to make the target forget how the Dragon-Blood cheated him out of a fortune or slept with his wife. Indeed, the Dragon-Blood can even compel his target to forget multiple encounters, although each separate encounter requires the expenditure of three motes and one Willpower. As this Charm is activated, the Exalt's player must roll (Manipulation + Socialize), adding the Dragon-Blood's Essence in automatic successes. Only the target's Dodge MDV is applicable to this role. If this roll is successful, the target forgets the event.
   Once the scene is over and the target's memories return, he will certainly be aware of what happened and will undoubtedly regret any unwise bargains he made while he was confused. Therefore, future uses of the Charm require the Exalt to erase the prior usage of the Charm as well as the original event(s) that needed to be erased. This Charm automatically fails when used against any target with a higher Essence trait than the Dragon-Blooded using the Charm.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It cannot be used during physical combat, but it can be activated on any long tick during social combat.</description>

            <errText>The Charm costs only 3m to target a descendant. If the roll for this unblockable unnatural influence succeeds, the target can pay 1wp right then to resist (but does not realize anyone attempted to alter her memories). Paying a total of 3wp this way immunizes a character from further use of the Charm by the Exalt for a day. Once memory has been suppressed, however, the cost to break free and remember the truth is 5wp per alteration. With Essence 5+, the duration drops to Instant, but suppressed memories remain so until reclaimed with appropriate Willpower expenditure.</errText>

        <description>When kin cry for vengeance, swords flash from their scabbards. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt shouts in anger and her player rolls (Charisma + Socialize). Every mortal and Dragon-Blood within 100 yards of the Terrestrial feels drawn to join her cause and inflict violence upon those who oppose the Prince of the Earth. This urge has no actual power to compel anyone, however, unless they are blood relatives of the Terrestrial with a lower Essence rating than her and their dodge MDV is less than the number of successes rolled. Such junior relatives must pay two Willpower points to resist the unnatural influence.
   Of all listeners who allow them-selves to be affected or who are compelled to take up arms, the Dragon-Blood's player chooses the most combatively capable to form a mass combat unit with Magnitude no greater than the character's Socialize rating. He also chooses which characters will serve as special characters (and in what capacity). The capabilities of affected characters are not known to the Exalt, but her player gets a basic gist, enough to make a tactically sound allocation of resources. The unit created by the Charm forms up around the Terrestrial in the blink of an eye, with every member having drawn the most suitable weapon available to him. If mass combat has not begun, a Join War roll is in order.
   This Charm has a special use in mass social combat in which the Terrestrial using it leads a social unit with Magnitude no greater than her Essence rating and all members are in range. Upon activation, the unit switches from a social unit to a mass combat unit, and a Join War roll is made for all parties who choose to involve themselves in the conflict. The Exalt adds her Essence rating in bonus successes to this roll, and precedes it with a ([Wits + Socialize] - Magnitude) roll to conceal the unit for a surprise attack at standard difficulty, as though the unit had actual concealment from which to launch the attack. The usual benefits of surprise apply to the unit's first attack if the Terrestrial establishes it. By activating this Charm, a unit of relaxed partygoers can suddenly spring into action, draw weapons and launch a devastating assault on the Exalt's astonished enemies. If multiple unit leaders use this Charm simultaneously, none get any chance to surprise attack other users, but each gains the usual Join War bonus and may attempt to surprise other units.</description>

        <description>Subsuming the smoldering resolve of her lineage into her spirit, a Dragon-Blood may become equally inviolable and implacable. She adds a bonus to her Dodge and Parry MDV equal to the Magnitude of the unit that would be formed by assembling all her living Dragon-Blooded descendents. This bonus does not apply against the social attacks of a direct ancestor. In addition, all descendents apply this same value as a penalty to their MDV when attempting to resist their ancestor's social attacks unless they also know this Charm.</description>

        <description>Salons, parties, and celebrations are the lifeblood of high society in the Realm. Such social occasions are a hotbed of whispered secrets, shifting alliances and sordid intrigues, requiring great care to ensure they don't erupt into violence or scandal. This Charm is a dramatic action to plan or cater for a social event, requiring at least an hour. These preparations imbue the party with the essence of politeness and harmony, with the following effects:
• All social attacks made at the event add +1 bonus success unless intended to result in harm to someone at the event. Planning future harm against attendees benefits from the success, so long as the plot doesn't interrupt the event itself.
• Characters that wish to start a fight suffer an unnatural Compulsion that forbids this, forcing them to pay two Willpower to roll Join Battle. Once a character does so, other characters need not resist to join the fight. Celestial Exalted and Essence 6+ beings are immune to this Compulsion.
• So long as the occasion is not spoiled by a brawl, grave faux pas, or similar interruption, all characters that spend at least a scene at the party gain a single positive Intimacy chosen by the Dragon-Blood at the time of activation. The Intimacy must somehow be appropriate to the atmosphere of the event, as approved by the Storyteller. Celestial Exalted and Essence 6+ beings can resist the Intimacy for free, but others must spend two Willpower. </description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Air Aspect moves in perfect harmony with the air around her, suppressing the sound of her movements. For one minute per mote spent, the Dragon-Blood can eliminate any noise she directly produces, but not sounds she causes that are not connected to her person. That is, she could smash in a window with a rock in complete silence, but if she threw that rock through that window, the sound would be clearly heard. The Charm does not provide any direct benefit to Stealth rolls, but it will eliminate the chance of attracting attention in many circumstances, such as areas protected by alarms. The individual under the influence of this Charm is unable to speak while Soundless Action Prana is in effect and must communicate through nonverbal means, perhaps through Charms such as Speech Without Words or With One Mind.</description>

            <errText>Characters using this Charm are ineligible targets for (Perception + Awareness) rolls based solely on hearing. For example, if the Exalt is moving around a room, but a closed door bars any visual detection, the sounds he would otherwise make do not prompt checks to notice him. Human-range senses other than vision and hearing are insufficiently acute to detect things at any real range, so an Exalt using Soundless Action Prana with full visual cover is basically undetectable without magic.</errText>

This zone of silence is centered on the character who invokes it, and it moves with him.</description>

        <description>This Charm allows the Air Aspect to cause the wind itself to aid in his attempts at in ltration by disturbing and distracting those who might notice his passage. The wind might tickle the ear of a listener, cause a torch to gutter or go out, or blow papers off a desk. Regardless, the result is a minor environmental effect, incapable of damaging anyone or anything, which nevertheless is potentially distracting to those nearby. The Dragon-Blood can continue to trigger distracting effects for the duration of a scene. For one mote of Essence, the Charm adds two automatic successes to any Stealth roll made against a single target. Each additional mote spent allows the Dragon-Blood to distract one additional target at the same time, up to a maximum number of targets equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence. Therefore, if the Dragon-Blood spends three motes of Essence, he can add two automatic successes to any rolls made against up to three people, but if he encounters five people in a search party, he would not get the automatic successes against two of the five. The Charm cannot add more than two automatic successes to a single roll, no matter how much Essence is spent.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood's preternatural stealth can now be extended to others. Moving with the lightness of a summer breeze, the Exalt and any allies to whom this Charm is extended leave no footprints, scents or other signs of their passage. By spending 2 motes, the Dragon-Blood can obliterate all signs of her passage for a distance of up to one mile. The Dragon-Blood can extend this concealment to her allies at a cost of an additional two motes per person, up to a total number of beings equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. When this Charm is activated, all non-supernatural attempts to track the protected characters fail automatically. Supernatural attempts to track the characters negate this Charm, and tracking is handled normally, as if neither party had used any supernatural effects.</description>

        <description>Like the wind whistling through the trees or across the ocean, it is not in the nature of the Dragon-Blooded to fall or to sink. Once this Charm is activated, the Dragon-Blood gains perfect balance and can move across any horizontal surface (including water and quicksand) without difficulty. The manner of movement is irrelevant and can include running, crawling or swinging on tree vines. If the Dragon-Blood ever stops moving for even a single action, however, the Charm ends. The Dragon-Blood can carry his normal gear but no more than that.</description>

        <description>The wind is not seen, but can only be detected through its effects on others. With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can bend light around himself to conceal his presence. The Exalt is not totally invisible, but can be detected as only a hazy blur. The Charm also muffles sound, masks scent, conceals body heat and generally protects against most forms of detection. Mechanically, the Dragon-Blood's identity is completely concealed by the blur, and every three motes spent adds one automatic success to Stealth-related rolls. However, the Charm does not actively conceal the character's passage, and he can be tracked normally unless Trackless Passage Style or other Charms are brought to bear.</description>

        <description>This Charm enhances an Exalt's Dragon Shroud Technique, extending the Charm's duration to Indefinite and automatically giving the characteristics and benefits of being invisible (-2 successes to spot or attack him, plus greater ease in launching surprise attacks or reestablishing surprise). In addition, the character may extend the Dragon Shroud Technique to as many allies as he has dots of Essence, as long as they join hands at the time of activation. He may, instead, cloak a single vehicle or warstrider by touching it (increasing the cost as noted). Cloaked vehicles may be hidden with Stealth as if they were the Exalt, without penalties for size, using Wits instead of Dexterity. Anything cloaked by Dragon Shroud Technique appears if it travels more than (Stealth x 5) yards from the Exalt or the Charm ends.</description>

        <description>The Children of Sextes Jylis are master woodsmen and trackers. With this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can track any quarry whose trail is less than a week old, regardless of terrain or weather conditions. Animal tracks and spoor literally glow to the Exalt's eyes, while broken twigs and other signs of a human's passage are equally as obvious. The tracker's player needs only a single success on a (Perception + Survival) roll for the tracker to successfully track any quarry not protected by supernatural stealth or evasion. Supernatural effects that hide a quarry's tracks are canceled by this Charm, allowing the Dragon-Blood to find his prey with a follow-up normal Survival roll.</description>

        <description>Any Dragon-Blood who knows this Charm can blend effortlessly into the woods, instinctively hiding all evidence of her passage. While this Charm is active, persons attempting to track the Dragon-Blood without supernatural aid are completely unable to do so. If the tracker is using supernatural aid such as Quarry Revelation Technique, the two effects cancel each other out, and normal tracking rules apply. It is rumored that Lunar Exalted are not fooled by this Charm at all when they wear their animal forms.</description>

        <description>The forests know their masters and do not hesitate to give up their bounties when asked. This Charm can greatly improve the success rate of any hunting or foraging expeditions in which the Dragon-Blood participates. This Charm lasts for the duration of a single hunt, in which the Dragon-Blood must be an active participant. The Charm can be used to aid just the Dragon-Blood, or it can be extended to include others in the hunting party at a cost of one mote of Essence per hunter. Only one application of this Charm can aid any single hunting party, however, and the Dragon-Blood can only aid one party at a time. While the Charm is in effect, the hunting party  finds twice as much food as the results on any Survival rolls would otherwise dictate.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood's intuitive knowledge of how to survive in difficult climes allows him to protect his fellows in all but the harshest conditions. In a hot environment, the Dragon-Blood can make certain that he and his allies can avoid heat prostration and other hazards. In a cold environment, he can enable his friends to better preserve body heat and avoid frostbite. For one day, the Dragon-Blood and his companions get three automatic successes on Survival rolls to resist adverse environmental conditions. In other words, any environmental penalty of three or less is reduced to zero, and persons protected by this Charm never suffer an environmental penalty greater than two. The cost is three motes plus one additional mote per companion protected. The Exalt can protect a maximum number of allies equal to his permanent Essence.</description>

        <description>As master survivalists, Wood Aspect Dragon-Blooded are often called upon to lead their fellows through rough terrain, whether while on a trade caravan or while treasure hunting at the edge of Creation. The Exalt using this Charm can improve the travel speed, endurance and morale of a group of personnel who travel with her.
   As long as the Exalt maintains the Charm, she and all who travel with her gain a number of automatic successes on fatigue checks equal to (her Essence - 2 [minimum 1]). Also, all travel times decrease by five percent per point of the Exalt's permanent Essence. The Charm can be used to affect anyone who travels with the Dragon-Blood, but a single Dragon-Blood can affect only a number of people (and their mounts) equal to her (Essence x 10). If multiple Dragon-Blooded activate this Charm together, each participant can affect a number of travelers equal to her (Essence x 10), and the total number of automatic successes gained on fatigue checks is equal to the combined Essence of all participants minus two. Travel times decrease according to the highest Essence of any participant (five percent per point) and are further reduced by an additional two percent per extra participant. The maximum number of participants who can join in a single cooperative use of this Charm is equal to the highest permanent Essence of any participant. The Essence spent is committed for the duration of the Charm, which lasts until the destination is reached or until the Dragon-Blood withdraws the commitment.</description>

        <description>This Charm allows a Dragon-Blood to reach out with her elemental anima to fashion a crude structure out of whatever elemental material is handy. Each different Charm is primarily useful in a particular environmental setting. Air is only useful in extremely cold, snowy climes and causes ice crystals to form out of the air itself into a simple igloo that retains heat remarkably well. Earth is most useful in open fields or on mountaintops and causes rocky slabs to slowly rise up out of the earth to form a lean-to. Fireis primarily used in the desert and causes sand to temporarily form into jagged silicate slabs that form a sheltered outcropping. The sandstone does not transfer heat to those taking shelter beneath it, and the outcropping is ideally situated to let wind flow through while keeping out sand. Water is primarily used on the ocean, although it can be used on other large bodies of water. The Charm causes seaweed, sunken debris and other material found within and beneath the waters to rise up to the surface and cling together, forming a remarkably buoyant life raft that can stay a oat in all but the most treacherous of weather. Wood can be used in any forest area, causing saplings to sprout from the forest floor to form a crude hut. The hut is camou aged against observers, who must get more successes on a (Perception + Survival) roll than the Dragon-Blood's Essence in order to detect it. All versions of this Charm are warded against intrusion by mundane animals. Such animals will not attempt to enter the shelter absent some type of magical compulsion.
   Once the Charm is activated, it takes about 30 minutes for the protective structure to form. The structure lasts for about a day, although the Dragon-Blood can extend the effect by committing the Essence indefinitely. The shelter is capable of protecting the Exalt herself and up to six other human-sized beings. If the Exalt wishes the shelter to hold more, she must spend an additional mote of Essence per extra person, although she cannot spend more extra motes than her Essence. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can fit in the same shelter consists of the Dragon-Blood herself, plus (Essence + 6) other people.
   This Charm is actually a cluster of Charms, one for each of the five elements. A Dragon-Blood can learn multiple versions of this Charm, but he must learn the one associated with his affinity element first. Regardless of which version is used, the Charm is always considered a Wood-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies.</description>

        <description>The pinnacle of the survivalist's skill, this Charm is actually a cluster of five elemental Charms. The Charm confers near total immunity to adverse environmental conditions for the Dragon-Blood. For the duration of one day, the Charm negates all external environmental penalties to Survival rolls provided that the right version for that environment is applied. With the proper Charm, a Dragon-Blood could stand naked on the coldest glacier or cross the hottest desert while wearing furs with little chance of frostbite, sunstroke or any other similar penalty. The Charm allows those affected to easily find food and water, and it protects them against natural environmental conditions, though not direct environmental damage. Therefore, Extension of the Fire Dragon's Blessing allows protected individuals to cross a searing desert as if it were a verdant plain on a crisp autumn morning, but it will convey no protection at all to actual fire. Each version of the Charm is attuned to one of the five elemental poles and will protect the user from direct exposure to the conditions at that pole.
   Air protects against extremes of cold and allows the Dragon-Blood to find food even on a frozen tundra. Earth permits the Dragon-Blood to walk through choking dust clouds without penalty and ensures that she will not accidentally trigger a rockslide no matter how loose the rocks are. If she is caught in an avalanche or otherwise buried alive, the Dragon-Blooded survives on an extremely limited air supply while the Charm lasts. Fire protects against extremes of heat and permits the Exalt to cross the hottest desert without sunburn and to easily find water there, as well as to ignore choking smoke and the tremendous heat produced by lava (although not direct contact with lava itself). Water protects against sunstroke and other maladies while the character is adrift at sea. It also allows the Exalt to ignore the effects of even the heaviest rains and practically guarantees that fish will jump into her nets. While the Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood can drink seawater as if it were fresh with no adverse effects. Wood lets her move easily through the most overgrown forest without so much as a bug bite and to ignore any natural (but not supernatural) poisons whose Toxicity does not exceed the Dragon-Blood's Essence. (While the Wood version grants improved resistance to all natural toxins, each of the other four versions grant the same immunity to poisonous plants and creatures indigenous to the region of Creation associated with those Charms).
   The Dragon-Blood can extend the benefits of these Charms to others at a cost of two motes per ally protected. All Essence spent is committed for the Charm's duration. Unlike many elemental Charms, a Dragon-Blood can learn more than one version of Extension of the (Element) Dragon's Blessing, but the Dragon-Blood must learn the version associated with her aspect first. More than one version can be used at a time, and they can even be activated simultaneously. Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be a Wood-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies.
   This Charm is a reflexive one that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick.</description>

            <errText>Once a character has any version of this Charm active, other known versions cost only 1m to activate and allies already protected by the first activation inherit other version benefits at no additional cost. Essence 5+ Exalted with all five versions active suffer no penalties, damage or other harm from any environmental conditions - even those not native to Creation like Primordial weather. Whenever an Exalt with this Charm creates a shelter with its prerequisite, the structure itself and all those within it automatically gain the protection associated with all known versions of Extension of the (Element) Dragon Blessing.</errText>

        <description>Wood-aspected Dragon-Bloods are known for both their innate skill as physicians and for their natural communion with nature. This Charm represents the intersection of these two skill sets, as the Dragon-Blood's knowledge of plant life and herbal remedies can now be combined with his skill as a healer. The Dragon-Blood can improve his Medicine dice pools by two dice per mote spent, although he cannot spend more dice than his Survival Ability rating (plus any applicable specialty). This Charm can stack with the First Medicine Excellency and is an exception to the normal limits on adding dice. Therefore, if both Charms are activated, the Dragon-Blood's Medicine dice pool can be increased by a total of ([his Medicine + specialty] + [his Survival + specialty]). In order to use this Charm, the Dragon-Blood must have access to plants and herbs capable of fulfilling his medicinal needs.</description>

        <description>Although Dragon-Bloods cannot match the longevity of their Celestial masters, some can at least approach it. Without this Charm, a Terrestrial lives 250 years, after which his player makes a (Stamina + Resistance) roll for each decade the character lives thereafter. (The difficulty begins at 1 then increases by one each decade). Failure means the character dies of old age sometime in the coming decade. With this Charm, the character adds his (Essence + Breeding) to the pool. Using the Martyr effect ensures actual immortality of a sort, in that Dragon-Blooded direct descendents perfectly know how their ancestor would act in any given situation if they bother to consider the fact. They are, however, under no compulsion to do as their ancestor would.
   If the Exalt has Essence 6+, stunts that recall and emphasize the character's physical purity in the preceding decade prevent the difficulty from increasing on that roll. Such stunts include abstaining from sex with mortals, avoiding recreational drugs or similar vices, eating a simple vegetarian diet with nothing besides tea or water, and having all Virtues rated 3+. The Storyteller should gradually increase the strictness of these stunt awards as the character ages.</description>

        <description>The Children of Mela are renowned for their skill with thrown weapons, a puissance that makes such weapons seem to come alive in their hands. When the Dragon-Blood throws a weapon (including a thrown melee weapon) and activates this Charm, an invisible ribbon of air is attached to it, allowing the Exalt to summon it back to her hand when its path is spent. Whether the weapon strikes its target or not, it will immediately return to the Exalt and be available for reuse on her next regular action. Thrown weapons still attack with their normal Speed, however, and the weapon will not be available for any reflexive uses between the ticks upon which the Dragon-Blooded normally acts. Anyone in the path of the returning weapon can attempt to pluck it out of the air, but doing so requires a successful (Dexterity + Athletics) roll, followed by an immediate reflexive opposed (Strength + Athletics) roll against the player of the weapon's owner. If the person attempting to snatch the weapon fails on either of these two rolls, the weapon is unimpeded on its return journey.</description>

        <description>The unearthly control of the Air Aspects over their throwing weapons continues to improve with this Charm. After the Dragon-Blood throws a weapon at a target, the weapon takes on a life of its own and continues to make extra attacks. The number of extra attacks is equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence, and each attack has the normal Speed for that particular weapon for determining the ticks upon which subsequent attacks occur. The attack roll made for the weapon is equal to the Dragon-Blood's (Perception + Thrown) pool. The Dragon-Blood can perform any other actions he desires as the weapon's independent attacks proceed, including using this Charm again on the same target with additional throwing weapons. The player must declare that he is invoking this Charm before rolling the first attack, and the target of the weapon cannot be changed during the Charm's duration. The target (or anyone else) can attempt to strike the weapon out of the air. Doing so requires an attack roll against a difficulty equal to the Dragon-Blood's permanent Essence. If this attack roll is successful, the weapon is knocked to the ground, where it will rest inert. If a character uses this Charm as part of a Combo, he must pay the Essence cost for the other Charms each time the weapon uses them, and the additional Charms must be used on each attack made. The Exalt needs to pay the Willpower cost of the Combo only once, though. The Loyal Weapon Charm is an exception to this rule, and if Loyal Weapon is put in a Combo with Persistent Hornet Attack, the weapon will make all of its requisite attacks and only then return to the Exalt. The Essence for the Loyal Weapon Charm needs to be paid only once.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood can conceal any number of thrown weapons Elsewhere and store them there for later use. Each weapon thus concealed costs 10 Essence and one Willpower. When the Dragon-Blood is ready to attack, he can reflexively summon any or all of them at no additional cost and attack on the same action. Such an attack suffers no penalties to the normal (Dexterity + Thrown) pool, and in fact, the Dragon-Blood remains free to use Charms to aid in the attack. The Dragon-Blood can hide a number of weapons equal to twice his Essence. These weapons cannot be detected except by beings or powers capable of perceiving items stored Elsewhere.</description>

        <description>The flawless skill of the Dragon-Blooded can even allow them to knock arrows and daggers from the air with a well-placed throw. The Exalt using this Charm can deflect ranged attacks aimed at himself or at allies at a cost of three motes plus one mote per each ally protected. While the Charm is in effect, the Dragon-Blood's Essence is automatically subtracted from any ranged attack dice pools rolled against him or his allies, in addition to the normal effects of DV. The Essence spent is committed for the duration of the Charm. This Charm does not require any actual weapons. Instead, the Whirlwind Shield is formed from the air itself, and any allies who are to be protected must be within (the Exalt's Essence) yards in order for the Dragon-Blood to shield them.</description>

        <description>A refinement of Whirlwind Shield Form, this Charm allows the Exalt to not only deflect incoming attacks, but to reflect them back on the attacker. If the Dragon-Blood is the target of a ranged attack, her player can opt to roll (Dexterity + Thrown) in place of relying on her normal DV. Each success on this roll subtracts from the attacker's successes, and if her successes exceed the attacker's, the projectile reverses course, attacking her opponent with a number of attack dice equal to her net successes. At a cost of four motes, the Dragon-Blood can also use this Charm in defense of an ally within a number of yards equal to her Essence.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be used on any tick on which the Dragon-Blood or an ally is the target of an attack.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood can summon throwing weapons out of thin air, fashioning them from the element to which she is aligned. Most commonly, the Charm summons throwing daggers, but some Dragon-Blooded summon more personalized weapons, such as shuriken, chakrams or throwing axes. Regardless of its external appearance, each weapon has a base Damage and Accuracy equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence and a range of (Essence x 10) yards. The Dragon-Blood can create up to (his Essence) weapons at a time. Once created, each weapon is thrown reflexively with the Dragon-Blood's full (Dexterity + Thrown) dice pool. If multiple weapons are created, they can all be thrown as part of a flurry. Elemental blades dissipate after the attack, but they can be put to uses other than striking a target during their brief duration, such as knocking an item out of someone's hand, slicing through ropes or even allowing the Dragon-Blood to parry lethal attacks.
   Additionally, the weapons summoned have special properties based on the elemental alignment of their creator: Air blades buffet the target, subtracting two dice from her next action. Earth blades knock the target back, forcing her player to roll (Dexterity + Athletics), difficulty 4, to keep the character from falling. Fire sets the target ablaze for an action for an additional 4L. Water  lls the target's lungs with seawater, adding three ticks before her next action due to violent coughing. Wood poisons the target, requiring her player to successfully roll (Stamina + Resistance) at a difficulty of (the Dragon-Blood's Essence) to avoid suffering a -1 penalty to all actions for the rest of the scene. (Subsequent successful uses of this poison effect are cumulative). In order to inflict any of these penalties, the Dragon-Blood must successfully hit his target. He cannot inflict a particular elemental effect more than once per action, however, regardless of how many blades he throws at his target as part of a flurry.
   Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be an Air-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies. A Dragon-Blood can learn only the version associated with his aspect.</description>

These weapons may be given to others, and vanish into nothingness if thrown at their creator or used for any purpose other than throwing them at a target. When thrown, they ignore all multiple action penalties that apply to the attack roll and impose elemental effects as explained, but vanish after hitting. Additional purchases of this Charm each add another element to the Exalt's repertoire beyond that of his aspect, but a created weapon can have only one element imbued in it.</errText>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood surrounds himself with a spinning vortex of material composed of his affinity element. Each mote of Essence spent adds 1L and 1B to the Dragon-Blood's soak, and the character can spend up to a number of motes equal to his dots in Thrown. The mystical armor is fully compatible with normal armor. The armor also has special additional effects based on the Dragon-Blood's aspect: Air armor consists of a swirling mass of ice crystals that buffet away ranged attacks, adding half the Dragon-Blood's Essence to his soak against ranged attacks. Earth armor consists of a cloud of swirling dust and particulate matter that obscures an attacker's view, adding half the Dragon-Blood's Essence to his DV against ranged attacks. Fire armor consists of a cloud of red-hot embers that impair the vision of attackers at close range, adding half the Dragon-Blood's Essence to his DV against melee attacks. Water armor surrounds the Dragon-Blood with a liquid cushion, adding half his Essence to his soak against melee attacks. Wood armor surrounds the Dragon-Blood with a cloud of choking pollen, allowing him to extend the effects of his anima-based plant toxins to anyone within a number of yards equal to his Essence.
   The Dragon-Blooded can extend the benefits of this Charm to others, the Essence cost increases to two motes per point of soak, and one Willpower must be spent for each individual protected by the Charm. The Exalt cannot use this Charm to provide armor to another Dragon-Blood of a different aspect, however, and no person can be the subject of more than one application of the Charm at the same time. Instead, the last application of the Charm takes precedence over any earlier applications.
   Regardless of the specific elemental version learned, each Charm is always considered to be an Air-aspected Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies. A Dragon-Blooded can learn only the version associated with his aspect.</description>

Elemental effects that state they provide DV bonuses instead apply an equivalent external penalty to all relevant incoming attacks. Each purchase of this Charm after the first adds an additional element to the Charm. Characters may evoke these by adding +2m per element to the Charm's cost, in which case the armor has the powers conferred by those elements in addition to its normal effects.</errText>

        <description>The Exalt gestures toward an opponent, and an invisible force emanates from her hand as an unblockable attack using her (Dexterity + Thrown + Essence) and a Range of 300 yards. If the attack hits, the Terrestrial may knock the target prone, drive him gently to his knees or send him flying back (Essence + Thrown + 5) yards. If a hurled target strikes a solid object, he and it suffer bashing damage equal to the remaining yards he would have traveled (possibly lethal, depending on the barrier). Targets significantly larger than human size cannot be thrown but may be knocked down. The Dragon-Blood may also impose an elemental effect according to her aspect. Air throws targets upward for double distance rather than back, leaving victims to fall normally. Earth inflicts three levels of unsoakable aggravated damage to Wyld creatures forced to kneel, petrifying the bodies of the slain. Fire catches the target alight for 4L damage. Water smashes, doubling knockback distance. Wood imposes sleep as a Poison effect on living targets knocked down if attack successes exceed their Stamina. Victims do not awaken until the end of the scene unless they suffer damage levels.
   Exalted with Essence 6+ may target units with a Magnitude no greater than their Essence (or an equivalent number of scattered individuals) with a single attack costing eight motes of Essence and one point of Willpower. This attack can knock a unit back or down like an individual. Applying the earth effect to a unit of Wyld creature extras obliterates it, likely leaving special characters merely wounded. Applying a wood effect to a unit whose members are all below the Stamina threshold lulls the whole unit to sleep.</description>

        <description>It is difficult to achieve success as a military commander if one cannot avoid immolating one's own troops. For each mote committed, the Dragon-Blood may temporarily render one soldier partially immune to the damaging effects of her elemental anima. Any damage inflicted on a protected soldier by the Dragon-Blood's anima or by other elemental effects attributable to her aspect is reduced by the Dragon-Blood's Essence. The nature of this Charm is such that a Dragon-Blood can only protect a mortal soldier who is considered at least nominally "under her command". Therefore, neither bystanders nor fellow Exalts can be protected by it. When the Charm is activated, all participants must be holding hands.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. It can be activated on any tick.</description>

Exalted acting as special characters in a complementary unit with Magnitude less than their Essence rating may pay 1m per Magnitude dot to shield all members of the unit with this Charm (and all their mounts, in the case of cavalry). Each additional Exalt using the Charm this way cumulatively adds +1 to the highest Essence rating among them to determine if the unit can be protected, but all participants must commit motes equal to the unit's Magnitude to do this.

        <description>From lowly fanglords to the greatest generals, all Dragon-Blooded of cers are gifted at motivating the soldiers under their command into extraordinary feats of endurance. With this cooperative Charm, one or more Dragon-Blooded begin a rhythmic cadence of some kind, such as a  fighting song or a call-and-response chant. The affected soldiers find that their packs lighten, their resolve stiffens and their morale improves.
   As long as the Exalt maintains the Charm, her unit gains a number of automatic successes on fatigue checks equal to her Essence  2 (minimum 1). Also, the unit's movement rate is doubled. The Charm can be used to affect only infantry units, and a single Dragon-Blood can affect only a number of fangs equal to (her Essence + 2). If multiple Dragon-Blooded activate this Charm together, each participant can affect a number of fangs equal to (his Essence + 2), and the total number of automatic successes gained on fatigue checks is equal to (the combined Essence of all participants  2). The maximum number of participants who can join in a single cooperative use of this Charm is equal to the highest permanent Essence of any participant. The Essence spent is committed for the duration of the Charm, which can last for a number of hours equal to the lowest permanent (Essence + Stamina) total of any participant.</description>

        <description>The Exalt focuses, invoking the durability of the Earth as an enchantment on his armor. The degree of benefit is determined by the composition of the armor as described in the following chart, as armor that is more durable to begin with can more easily resist having its nature altered by Essence. The Exalt can also extend this benefit to any ally within a number of yards equal to his (Essence x 3) by paying the same cost for each ally protected. A character can benefit from the application of this Charm only once during a scene, and the Charm ends prematurely if the armor is removed for any reason before the end of the scene.

        <description>The wise commander knows that sometimes the appearance of superior numbers is as valuable as actually having enough troops to outnumber the enemy. This Charm allows a Dragon-Blood to fashion illusory troops from her aligned element. The area around the Dragon-Blood appears to be  lled with warriors fashioned out of the element to which he is aspected. Although the Charm is Elemental in nature, there is no difference in its effects beyond cosmetics. For example, fire warriors appear to be formed of smoke and embers, while earth warriors appear to be made of dust, and wood warriors of leaves and grass assembled into a roughly humanoid shape. While the phantoms are illusory, they are also quite intimidating, and the player of any enemy of the Dragon-Blood in the area must successfully roll his character's Valor or suffer a -1 penalty on all dice pools through his next action. Mortals must score as many successes on the Valor roll as the Dragon-Blood's Presence, while beings with an Essence higher than 1 need only a single success. The phantom warriors are spread out over an area with a radius equal to the Dragon-Blood's (permanent Essence x 10), and they affect everyone in that area who is not allied with the Dragon-Blood who created them.
   If the Charm is deployed in mass combat, the opposing force must make an immediate rout check at a -1 penalty. If the roll is successful, the opposing force suffers no other penalty.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. However, the Dragon-Blood is limited in using the Charm as follows: The Charm can only be activated on a tick when the Dragon-Blood performs an action. It cannot be activated on the ticks between actions. In Mass Combat, it can be activated on any long tick in which the Dragon-Blood acts.</description>

        <description>To the Children of Pasiap, the battlefield is clay to be shaped according to the demands of military tactics. With this Charm, the Dragon-Blood can stamp his foot or smite the ground with his fists, and the earth responds to its master. Up to a cubic yard of dirt or similar earthy material can be shaped to the Dragon-Blood's will. The earth can be wrenched up and compressed to form a crude barrier capable of providing cover against arrows or disrupting a cavalry charge or an infantry formation. It can be compressed beneath the feet of an advancing force, requiring all those caught within the resulting sinkhole to succeed on a (Dexterity + Athletics) to avoid knockdown. Finally, the Charm can be used for  excavation, as the Exalt tunnels into the ground, compressing the earth away from him and leaving rock-hard tunnel walls in his wake. The compressed earth has a soak of 5L/8B and a Hardness of 4. Each area roughly a yard thick requires 20 health levels to damage and 30 to destroy. The Charm can be used to manipulate dirt, sand, pebbles and even mud, but it has no effect on actual rock of any density.
   This is a reflexive Charm that can be used freely without the need for a Combo. The Dragon-Blood is, however, limited in using the Charm as follows: The Charm can be activated only on a tick when the Dragon-Blood performs an action. It cannot be activated on the ticks between actions.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood can impose his elemental anima on a large area equal to his (Essence x 50) yards in radius and centered on any outdoor location within his line of sight. Anyone who comes within this area suffers an environmental penalty on all actions equal to the Dragon-Blood's War Ability rating, as earth tremors, rainstorms, snow flurries, clouds of acrid smoke or simply fast-growing briar patches spring into existence to harry those caught within. The exact effect depends on the Dragon-Blood's aspect, but the environmental penalty is the same, regardless of aspect. Dragon-Blooded of the same aspect as the one who invoked the Charm are immune to the environmental penalty, as are any individuals attuned to him through the Charm Enfolded in the Dragon's Wings. Dragon-Blooded of other aspects are immune if their anima banners are at the 8+ motes level.
   This is a cooperative Charm, and multiple Terrestrials who know the Charm can activate it cooperatively to increase its effects. When they do, the area affected is equal to the combined (Essence of all participants x 100) yards, and the environmental penalty imposed is equal to highest War Ability rating of any participant, plus one for each additional participant. The maximum number of participants is equal to the permanent Essence of the Dragon-Blood who has the highest War Ability rating. Other Dragon-Blooded are immune to the environmental effects if they share the same aspect as any participant to the activation of this Charm, as are mortal soldiers protected by the use of Enfolded in the Dragon's Wings by any participant.</description>

        <description>This Charm is identical to Dragon-Seared Battlefield except as follows: In addition to the environmental penalty imposed on all persons caught on the battlefield when the Charm is invoked, the Dragon-Blood can direct the raging miasma of elemental energy to injure his enemies. On the tick that this Charm is activated, everyone within the area of effect suffers a number of levels of lethal damage equal to the Dragon-Blood's Essence. The same amount of damage is inflicted again five ticks later and every five ticks thereafter while the Charm is in effect. This damage takes the forms of flying shards of stone or razor-sharp ice, swirling gouts of flame or steam, or even explosions of needles from enormous thorn bushes that spring from the ground. The damage cannot be dodged or parried except with perfect effects. The Dragon-Blood who initiates the Dragon Vortex Attack is immune to its effects, as are any Dragon-Blooded of the same aspect and any Dragon-Blooded regardless of aspect whose anima banners are at the 8+ motes level. If the Dragon-Blood who invokes this Charm has protected mortal soldiers with Enfolded in the Dragon's Wings, they too are protected from the vortex.
   If several Dragon-Bloods who know this Charm use it cooperatively, their combined Essence is used to calculate the radius of the damage, and the damage inflicted is equal to the highest Essence of any participant plus one for each additional participant, in addition to the combined environmental penalty described under Dragon-Seared Battlefield. Also, if the participants have different elemental affinities, every Dragon-Blood within range who shares affinity with any participant is immune to the Charm's effects, as is every mortal soldier who is protected by an application of Enfolded in the Dragon's Wings used by any participant. Therefore, if an Air Aspect, a Water Aspect and a Wood Aspect combine their powers to invoke the Dragon Vortex Attack, the radius would be equal to their (combined Essence x 100) yards. Every Dragon-Blood within range who was an Air, Water or Wood Aspect would be immune, every Fire or Earth Aspect would be affected normally, and every mortal soldier who was protected by Enfolded in the Dragon's Wings by any of the three Dragon-Blooded would be immune. The maximum number of participants in the application of this Charm is five, so, common military practice is to have one participant of each aspect, thereby ensuring that every Dragon-Blood within the Vortex radius would be immune.</description>

            <errText>This Charm creates an environmental hazard within its radius that inflicts (Essence rating)L dice of damage (not levels, unless Essence 7+) per action with Trauma (Essence rating). If a Dragon-Blood is immune to a vortex, characters she has protected with Enfolded in the Dragon’s Wings are also immune (not just those protected by the vortex's creator). A second purchase of this Charm at Essence 6+ adds the Holy keyword, inflicting aggravated damage to creatures of darkness.</errText>

        <description>Wise strategy is the cornerstone of victory, supporting the totality of other competencies. If this rock holds, so too will the forces a Terrestrial commands. All activations of this Charm stack, but the Exalt cannot commit more motes among all activations than his (War + 3). While the Charm is active and the Terrestrial commands a complementary unit with Magnitude 3+, he can use his War Excellency to enhance all attack and defense actions he orders that unit to take, regardless of the Ability used. He cannot add more dice to a roll this way than the number of motes committed to all activations of Tactics Mean Everything or (War + appropriate specialty), whichever is less.
   Solar and Abyssal Exalted have Charms that are Mirror to one another named Shining General Puissance and Dread Warlord Stratagem (respectively) which have the same trait minimums and prerequisites as Tactics Mean Everything. These Charms are permanent, allowing use of War Excellencies to enhance attack and defense actions as though they were Excellencies for the appropriate Ability while commanding a Magnitude 3+ unit.</description>

        <description>Dragon-Blooded can lead, but they are more powerful when they serve. Any special character in a complementary unit who knows this Charm may activate it to enhance the unit. If the Terrestrial is the unit leader, he may choose any other special character in the unit as the target. If the Exalt is another kind of special character, he targets himself. Either way, the unit leader's War rating increases to the target character's War rating and the unit gains +1 Drill and +1 Morale from superior tactical coordination (to a maximum Drill and Morale of the unit leader's current War rating, or [War + Essence] if the leader is a Terrestrial with Breeding 5 or a Celestial Exalt). A unit may benefit from multiple activations of this Charm by separate special characters to improve its Drill and Morale, but the unit leader's War does not improve beyond the highest rating among contributing characters. This Charm remains active as long as the unit remains together.</description>

        <description>When the Chosen of the Elemental Dragons issue orders, the soldiers under their command pay attention. Any special character in a complementary unit with Magnitude 3+ who knows this Charm may activate it to enhance the unit. For the duration of the Charm, that Exalt counts as (War rating) relays in addition to whatever other role she serves, and her unit may take a reflexive Signal Units action once per action tick to coordinate with allied forces. Unit leaders also add a number of bonus successes to all rally actions and rolls to avoid losing Endurance points equal to the number of special characters in the unit using this Charm. Special characters who are blood relatives to all other special characters in the unit double all benefits they provide by using this Charm (and count a unit leader who is a Celestial Exalt as a blood relative for this purpose). Roaring Dragon Officer remains active as long as the unit remains together.</description>

        <description>The Elemental Dragons bless the armies led by their Chosen. Any special character who knows this Charm may activate it to enhance an infantry or cavalry complementary unit with Magnitude 3+ to which he belongs. The effect is based on that Exalt's aspect. The benefits of different elements stack with one another, but a unit can apply each one only once. The Might of a unit blessed by this Charm increases to a minimum value of the number of separate elemental permutations of this Charm enhancing it (so a unit simultaneously enchanted by a Fire Aspect and Water Aspect becomes Might 2). If the unit's Might already exceeds this value, this benefit does not apply. Terrestrials may use their Breeding in place of Essence rating when determining the bonuses provided by Glorious Five Dragon Army.
   Air: Mela grants troops great swiftness and mobility. Add the Exalt's Essence rating to the unit's Dexterity to calculate base Move and Dash speeds before applying the formation multiplier. Cavalry units simply double their normal speed. Furthermore, the unit may perform Turn actions reflexively and automatically without a roll, though each turn imposes a -1 DV penalty as normal. If the Exalt has Essence 5+, the unit's Dash actions automatically succeed without a roll and do not subtract from Endurance.
   Earth: Pasiap provides durability, adding the Exalt's Essence rating to the unit's armor and providing a Hardness equal to half the unit's boosted Armor rating. A Terrestrial with Essence 5+ also adds his Essence in extra levels to the unit's health track at each dot of Magnitude.
   Fire: The flames of Hesiesh spark in every raised blade, adding the Exalt's Essence rating to the unit's Close Combat Damage. A Dragon-Blood with Essence 5+ brings smoldering righteousness to the unit, doubling this bonus when attacking units composed of creatures of darkness as a Holy effect.
   Water: The waves of Daana'd wash over enemies as a drowning tide and recede just as inexorably. This effect adds the Exalt's Essence in bonus successes to the unit's Disengage actions and adds the same value to the difficulty for enemy units to disengage from the enchanted unit. Essence 5+ doubles this value, all but ensuring automatic success or failure to escape, respectively.
   Wood: A unit blessed by Sextes Jylis is dynamic and organic, able to change formation in Step Two as a reflexive -1 DV action ahead of incoming attacks rather than afterward. Additionally, the unit adds a number of bonus successes equal to the Exalt's Essence on all rolls to change forma-tion and half this value to its Ranged Combat Damage. With Essence 5+, the unit automatically succeeds on all rolls to change formation and adds the Exalt's Essence rating to its Ranged Combat Damage.</description>

        <description>The grace of the Elemental Dragons uplifts the souls entrusted to their care. This Charm is actually a cluster of Charms, one per element. A Dragon-Blood must learn the version appropriate to her aspect before she learns any others. All of the permutations work similarly, in that they may be used to teach a unit of students with a Magnitude no greater than the instructor's Essence rating. Each period of instruction requires 10 hours of instruction per day for two weeks straight. The beginning and end of each training regimen must fall inside the season that corresponds to the Charm's aspect. Failing to teach to this exacting schedule does nothing for the students but waste their time. Any pupil who misses so much as a minute of the lesson derives no benefit.
   Each period of instruction may be spent to increase the student's ratings in any of the traits listed for the specific Charm version by one dot as a Training effect, up a maximum of the Exalt's own rating or his Essence, whichever is less. Non-extra students who are blood relatives of the instructor are limited only by the teacher's rating in the trait. Trait listings are broken into basic, intermediate and advanced categories according to who can learn them from the Charm: anyone (basic), non-extras (intermediate) and Exalted (advanced). Celestial Exalted students are considered blood relatives for the purpose of this Charm and gain the instructed trait after studying only one hour per day for a week. Moreover, classes for Celestial Exalted are not limited by season.
   With an activation of this Charm, a Dragon-Blood can specifically target a willing Essence 4+ Celestial Exalt in her presence who knows a valid trait at an equal or better rating than herself. She may then begin an instruction period with a second normal use of the Charm any time before the targeted activation expires. If she does so, her patron's Celestial Essence augments her teaching, allowing her to instruct any students as though they were Celestial Exalted.
   Air: Basic: Linguistics (can teach only those languages the instructor knows; this is the only trait that may be conferred by any version of this Charm to students who do not share a language with the teacher), Thrown. Intermediate: Any non-thaumaturgy specialty for Air Aspect Abilities, Stealth, Willpower. Advanced: Lore, Occult, Wits.
   Earth: Basic: Awareness, Resistance. Intermediate: Any specialty for Earth Aspect Abilities, Mundane Crafts, Temperance. Advanced: Integrity, War, Stamina.
   Fire: Basic: Athletics, Melee. Intermediate: Any specialty for Fire Aspect Abilities, Dodge, Valor. Advanced: Presence, Socialize,  Dexterity.
   Water: Basic: Martial Arts, Sail. Intermediate: Any specialty for Water Aspect Abilities, Bureaucracy, Conviction. Advanced: Investigation, Larceny, Strength.
   Wood: Basic: Archery, Survival. Intermediate: Any specialty for Wood Aspect Abilities, Medicine, Compassion. Advanced: Performance, Ride, Perception.</description>

        <description>To be a hero is to be a target. This Charm can enhance any attack using any Ability aimed at a special character in mass combat. The attacker may be a complementary unit as a whole, a special character within that unit or a solo unit. Regardless, the enhanced attack ignores the usual penalty for a called shot on the special character as well as all penalties for extended range or distracting environmental conditions. This Charm may be used by special characters to interfere with a mid-battle duel by attacking an enemy champion, but otherwise has no use in personal combat. Army-to-Mob Assault may be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>Those with lesser rank are not necessarily lesser. This Charm is actually two Charms, one for heroes and one for sorcerers. Characters may learn both. Whenever a Terrestrial makes a separate attack as the appropriate type of special character using any Ability, he may activate this Charm to enhance the action. Doing so improves the attack with the benefits of the unit's Close Combat Rating, Ranged Combat Rating, Close Combat Damage, Ranged Combat Damage and Might as appropriate, applying these bonuses in the same way that they improve the unit's own attacks. This Charm may be placed in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.</description>

        <description>Those who step forward as righteous champions of their armies never truly stand alone. This Charm may be activated by any Terrestrial acting as a champion in a mid-battle duel. For the duration of the duel, he accepts the limit of his War rating to use his other Abilities as though he were leading a complementary unit. In exchange, however, his actions gain the usual modifiers his unit receives from its traits whenever he is attacking or defending against the enemy champion. The unit's Might does not add to his Essence to resist effects, but the unit's Might is considered one dot higher if the Exalt is a blood relative of every member of his unit. Magnitude modifiers are based on the relative Magnitude of his unit and the unit whose champion he is dueling. This Charm may also be activated by a special character in a complementary unit during a duel to enhance a Celestial Exalted champion from the Terrestrial's unit. If multiple effects allow an individual to enjoy the benefits of a unit while acting as an individual, these do not stack.
   A second purchase of this Charm requires Essence 5+, but allows an Exalt using it to activate the non-permanent Dragon-Blooded Charms or Terrestrial Martial Arts Charms known by special characters in his unit as though he knew them, provided he meets their trait minimums. Borrowed Charms terminate along with Blessed Dragon Champion when the duel ends. This power is not conferred if the Charm enhances a Celestial champion.</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood holds out his hand toward an instance of Dragon-Seared Battlefield or Dragon Vortex Attack he created and can currently perceive. With each purchase of Wrath-Directing Gesture, the Terrestrial learns one of the telepathic commands listed here, some of which require higher Essence minimums,    can target only a Dragon Vortex attack and have a higher cost. Each activation issues one order.
   Drift: The field moves in whatever direction the Exalt indicates, traveling at any velocity up to its creator's base Move speed. It maintains course and speed until given a new direction.
   Follow: The field attaches itself to a target individual, unit, object or vehicle within it. It constantly relocates to center on that target and stays affixed until given new instructions. While anchored to its creator, a field increases its duration to Indefinite.
   Sculpt: The field changes its size and shape, instantly assuming any form the Exalt can imagine that fits inside its maximum allowed radius.
   Shield: Essence 5; vortex only; Cost: 6m. If within the field, the Exalt directs it to flare in Step Two as a defense against an attack originating from outside the vortex. Any fellow officer can pay the cost on his behalf, even those who don't know the Charm. The flare makes the field's outer edge indestructibly solid for a moment. Area attacks larger than the field affect everything around it normally, but do not penetrate the barrier. The fact that the vortex tends to destroy whatever it "protects" constitutes a unique flaw of invulnerability on this perfect defense.
   Teleport: Essence 6; vortex only; Cost: 10m, 1wp. The Exalt teleports to the center of the field as a Leader effect (any fellow officer can pay this cost on his behalf, even those who don't know the Charm). He arrives as close to the center as physically possible and can't teleport if there is insufficient vacant space to accommodate his arrival.</description>

        <description>In the time before humanity, primeval Creation rumbled with the aftershocks of its making and the roars of the Elemental Dragons. So may it be again when the mightiest among the Dragon-Blooded host unleash their fury upon the world. Upon activating this Charm, elemental forces spread out for one hour to herald impending doom. Unless stopped by the mercy or death of the Exalt, this buildup concludes with a disaster appropriate to her aspect over an area with a radius in miles equal to her Essence, centered up to a number of miles away equal to her Essence. In the outer half of this radius, the effects impose significant penalties and undesirable conditions for the scene. Within the primary core of the disaster, the power of the Elemental Dragon manifests directly for one attack. All damage caused by this Charm is considered to be environmental damage; barring protection from such catastrophes, only a perfect parry or dodge can avoid the dragon's wrath. Storytellers should feel free to assess other logical indirect effects as appropriate to the stated effects of this Charm. A Martyr activation of this Charm cannot be prevented once set in motion. It subsumes the Exalt's body and soul alike into her progenitor Dragon.
   Air: The sky darkens with sudden roiling clouds, drenching everything in the radius with torrential rains. In addition to causing flash flooding, visibility is reduced to none and all non-reflexive actions in the area suffer a -5 external penalty from distraction. Within the primary core, the iconic presence of the Elemental Dragon of Air coils downward and sucks everything into the lightning-blasted typhoon, inflicting 100B piercing damage on everything in a column as high as the sky itself.
   Earth: The land shakes and grinds horrifically throughout the radius, while the center tears apart in the yawning chasm of the Earth Dragon's jaws. All in the area of effect suffer knockdown each action that they remain in contact with the earth, unless they are aided by some form of supernatural balance. Everything that falls into the chasm is crushed for 120B piercing damage, after which any survivors must climb over 500 yards up the walls of the crater. Use of this effect at sea triggers a massive suction whirlpool, which causes rough seas for seaworthy vessels (and a -2 external penalty to crewmembers), but imposes the effects of a hurricane at sea on all swimmers (see Exalted, p. 155). Damage inside the whirlpool is the same as for a sinkhole.
   Fire: A stream of molten magma explodes up from the deepest bowels of the earth as the iconic presence of the Dragon of Fire flies to the surface, incinerating everything in its path. Where it erupts, it sends clouds of ash and soot that impose a -5 external penalty. Inside the central half, the geyser inflicts 75L piercing damage and reaches aerial targets up to 500 yards above. This effect works equally well at sea, leaving behind a small island when the lava cools.
   Water: Usable only at sea or over sufficiently large bodies of water, this effect boils and shapes the waves into a towering tsunami avatar of the Elemental Dragon of Water. This superwave is not limited to the central half, but instead inflicts 100B piercing damage on everything in its range and everything flying above the waters up to 500 yards high. Afterward, the spray and churning waters impose a -3 external penalty, on top of the usual effects of tempest-wracked waves for swimmers (see Exalted, p. 155).
   Wood: The emerald coils of the Elemental Dragon of Wood writhe over land and sea, trailing sudden growth of thorny vines or tangling seaweed erupting over the entire area. The full radius of the Charm becomes indefinitely impassable until the dense vegetation can be cleared. Treat the entire area as extreme terrain with actual barricades (see Exalted, p. 163), with the same rules assessed against individual travelers. This growth paralyzes units and naval vessels on the battlefield as it grows around them. Although characters do not suffer immediate damage from the vines, structures across the entire radius suffer 30B piercing damage from the roots tearing apart foundations and pulling down walls. Worst of all, the plants in the core bloom with deadly pollen comparable to coral snake venom (see Exalted, p. 131). Although flying characters are safe from the vines, the pollen cloud reaches 300 yards into the air.</description>

        <description>While Dragon-Blooded cannot train units as well as Solars, those of sufficient tactical skill and dedication may transform themselves into incarnate extensions of a Lawgiver general. Tiger-Dragon Drill Approach may be activated only upon graduating from a week of Tiger Warrior Training Technique as part of a unit (see Exalted, p. 198). Doing so binds the Terrestrial to his teacher with an Intimacy of loyalty that cannot be eroded as long as this Charm remains active. More importantly, the Dragon-Blood temporarily learns Tiger Warrior Training Technique for this Charm's duration with two limitations. First, he can train units only in the trait he was trained in when he activated the Charm. Second, he can use the Charm only in fulfillment of direct orders from the Solar who taught him. The death of that Solar prematurely ends this Charm, revoking the Terrestrial's ability to create further tiger warriors until he can find a new Lawgiver patron.</description>
