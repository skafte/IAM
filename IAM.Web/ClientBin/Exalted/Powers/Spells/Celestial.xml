    <description>The Solar vanishes from others' sight. This Charm makes it impossible to detect the character with any sense save touch -unless they bump into him, observers simply cannot spot the character. This Charm fades instantly if the character joins battle or moves (with the Move action, the Dash action or their narrative and dramatic equivalents.) It fades automatically five ticks after someone notices the character by touch.</description>
