            <description>These Charms govern the circumstances by which a raksha enters Creation or some other shaped realm. Only a raksha who has already shaped an identity for herself through the Gateway of Sundraprisha Charm is capable of then refining that body through an Assumption Charm. In other words, unshaped raksha can never use Assumption Charms while still remaining unshaped, although unshaped can learn Assumption Charms and frequently use them in crafting oneiromantic effects and other such phenomena. The Assumption Charm (or Charms) deployed by a raksha may influence the form she takes in Creation, but any alterations to her appearance are purely cosmetic absent the application of mutations or other Charms. These Charms are Stackable in that a raksha can activate as many Assumptions simultaneously as she can afford. A raksha who carries multiple active Assumptions can choose the form in which she appears from all the choices her active Assumption Charms give her. The magical benefits of all of her active Assumption Charms are constantly available.</description>

                <errText>A raksha may simultaneously wear multiple Assumption Charms, but this does not render them Stackable, as they are technically separate Charms. Raksha who have multiple active Assumptions may not selectively choose which to manifest - she wears all her active forms at once. She is a sentient stain on a city, and a person strolling through it. A raksha made of fire and joy may not switch between being made of joy and being made of fire - she is a raksha made of fire and joy, at all times. Raksha who have taken an Assumption as a permanent Charm may still activate additional Assumptions, modifying their permanent body thereby. Thus, a raksha with a permanent Assumption of Fire Shape may also wear an Assumption of Water Shape or Assumption of Cerements and Bone, permitting her to one day appear as a raksha of steam, the next as a raksha of pyre-flame. She must always be a raksha wearing an Assumption of Fire to at least some degree, however - such is the price of becoming a permanent being of shape.
   The Essence cost of Assumption Charms must be committed while they remain active, as normal. Raksha who do not wish to pay this onerous Essence burden may learn an Assumption as a permanent Charm with no associated Essence cost... but in doing so they irreversibly render themselves shaped beings, becoming that which the unshaped of the deep Wyld hate above all else. Raksha may learn no more than one Assumption as a permanent Charm.</errText>

        <description>This Charm permits a shaped Raksha to enter Creation in a form (usually humanoid) aspected to one of the five elements. This is the most commonly used Assumption among noble Raksha. This Charm is actually a cluster of five separate Charms, each of which confers a different benefit and must be learned separately. The Raksha chooses the element he will assume when invoking this Charm and cannot change it without reentering the Wyld to dispel and then reapply this Charm. Raksha who rely on this Charm to construct shapes for themselves in Creation have access to an array of related Charms - the Elemental Influence Charms beginning on page 161 - to further improve the quality of their elemental forms.
   A Raksha who maintains multiple versions of this Charm has the option of wearing any of the forms available to him or of combining two or more elements into a single form. For example, a Raksha who had activated both Assumption of Air Shape and Assumption of Fire Shape would have the option of appearing as a being of solid smoke, while another Raksha could combine Assumption of Earth Shape and Assumption of Water Shape to manifest as a creature of mud.
   Assumption of Air Shape: A Raksha who enters Creation in this form suffers no ill effects from cold and can walk on ice or snow as if it were solid, stable ground. Raksha protected by Assumption of Air Shape often appear to be made of ice or snow, or simply have luminescent white skin.
   Assumption of Earth Shape: A Raksha who enters Creation in this form can see clearly in the darkest depths. Raksha protected by Assumption of Earth Shape often have bodies of stone, earth or precious gems, or simply have brown or jet-black skin.
   Assumption of Fire Shape: A Raksha who enters Creation in this form is immune to all non-magical heat- and fire-based forms of damage. Raksha protected by Assumption of Fire Shape frequently appear to be made of fire or magma, or simply have red, orange or black skin.
   Assumption of Water Shape: A Raksha who enters Creation in this form can swim at her normal movement rate, can breathe water as well as air and can otherwise function freely in an aquatic environment. Raksha protected by Assumption of Water Shape often have liquid forms, or simply possess blue or green skin.
   Assumption of Wood Shape: A Raksha who enters Creation in this form can maintain his balance on even the thinnest tree branch. The Raksha can also resist any natural poison with just one success on a (Stamina + Resistance) roll. Raksha protected by Assumption of Wood Shape appear to be covered in bark, leaves or moss, or simply possess brown or green skin.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: Incorporated into an oneiromancy spell, this Charm allows the spell to exist in Creation in some kind of elemental form, such as an object of wood or paper (which is based on Assumption of Wood Shape), a potion (which is based on Assumption of Water Shape), or one made of metal (which is based on Assumption of Earth Shape or Assumption of Fire Shape).</description>

        <description>This Charm permits a shaped Raksha to exist in Creation in a humanoid form with animalistic characteristics. When first acquiring this Charm, the Raksha must choose a specific animal of Creation upon which she bases her bestial form. The Raksha gains a number of mutation points equal to her Essence to apply to the Assumption, which can be used to purchase poxes, afflictions, blights or abominations appropriate to modeling the animal the Raksha will emulate. For example, a cat-based Raksha with Essence 2 might possess some combination of Claws, Enhanced Sight, Fur or a Tail, each of which is a pox worth one mutation point (see Exalted, p. 288). The mutation points acquired through this Assumption, however, are considered to have a mutation point cost of 0 for purposes of calculating the Raksha's (mutation point + Essence) total as described on page 151. When the Raksha increases her Essence, she can acquire a new mutation appropriate to her chosen animal form or she can "save" her mutation points applicable to this Charm to purchase more expensive mutations.
   Each time the Raksha purchases this Charm, it grants her the characteristics of a different animal. The Assumption always causes the Raksha to enter Creation in a humanoid form with animal characteristics instead of simply in the form of an animal, absent the use of other Charms. This is the Assumption most commonly used by commoner Raksha.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: Incorporated into an oneiromancy spell, this Charm allows the spell to exist in Creation in some kind of animalistic form, such as a bull's horn or a monkey's paw.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits a shaped Raksha to exist in Creation or the Underworld in a form resembling one of the undead. The Raksha is material, intelligent and ambulatory while in Creation but is otherwise treated as being one of the dead. The Raksha can receive Essence from burnt offerings, and she is vulnerable to the powers of Deathlords and the like. While in this form, the Raksha can use Charms such as Banquet of Crumbs in a shadowland or in the Underworld, and ghosts become valid targets for Ravishing the Created Form and other Feeding Charms.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: Incorporated into an oneiromancy spell, this Charm allows the spell to exist in Creation in some kind of death-aspected form, such as a human skull or a cursed coffin.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits a shaped Raksha to exist in Creation in a humanoid form without the obviously inhuman appearance associated with most Assumption Charms. The Raksha's new form is cunningly crafted to invoke in those around him a particular emotion or passion or belief important to the Raksha's identity. While wearing this shape, the Raksha adds one automatic success to all social rolls where invoking that emotion is useful. For example, a beautiful Luminary who had assumed the aspect of love might gain one automatic success on all rolls to seduce mortals, while a terrible Cataphract who had assumed the aspect of fear might gain an automatic success to intimidation rolls. A Raksha could also use this Charm in order to pose as a specific individual, adding one automatic success to all rolls necessary to maintain the imposture.
   The Raksha chooses the emotion or passion or belief when invoking this Charm and cannot change it without entering the Wyld to dispel and then reapply this Charm. If he is willing to pay the cost, however, the Raksha may choose to activate more than one version of this Charm simultaneously. For example, he could assume one form based on love and another based on fear and a third that lets him pose as a specific individual such as the madam of a local whorehouse or the Dragon-Blooded satrap of the whole city. Although only one of those forms is physically apparent at a time, the Raksha can draw upon the automatic success benefits of all three versions. A Raksha cannot, however, add more than one automatic success to a single roll no matter how many concurrent versions of this Charm he has active.
       Raksha who rely on this Charm to walk in Creation have access to an array of related Charms - the Emotional Influence Charms beginning on page 166 - to further improve the quality of their emotional forms.
   Glamour Resistance: A Raksha who bases his form on the Assumption of Dreams and Passion cannot apply his automatic success bonus to social rolls against Creation-born whose (Temperance + Essence) exceeds her Manipulation.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: Incorporated into an oneiromancy spell, this Charm allows the spell to exist in Creation in some kind of emotionally resonant form, such as a heart-shaped locket to represent love or a blood-stained whip to represent fear.</description>

        <description>This Charm allows the Raksha instill a minor Wyld taint on a Creation-born. If used as an Assumption Charm, Assumption of the Person's Heart costs 10 motes and one gossamer and must be activated while in sight of the Creation-born to be tainted. Thereafter, the Raksha can travel into Creation along with the affected Creation-born. Her assumed form is designed to appeal to the Creation-born's emotions in some way, whether to entice him or to terrify him. Regardless, the Raksha gains two automatic successes on all social rolls against the Creation-born she taints. If the Raksha has also activated Assumption of Dreams and Passion, the automatic successes from both Charms stack.
   If the Raksha has activated no other Assumptions, she has no manifested existence in Creation apart from the one she taints. If the Creation-born is rendered unconscious or if she leaves his sight, she instantly dematerializes as if she were a spirit (but at no Essence cost), and she has no power to affect Creation or be perceived by others who are unable to sense dematerialized spirits. In this state, the Raksha can be harmed only by attacks capable of harming dematerialized spirits. If the tainted Creation-born is slain and the Raksha has no other active Assumptions, she suffers the effects of normal calcification effects for a Raksha caught in Creation without an Assumption Charm. If the Raksha does have another active Assumption, she can freely materialize into that form and dematerialize at will at a cost of one mote.
   While the link between the two endures, the Raksha can share the benefits of any active mutations or innate powers she currently possesses with her pet Creation-born. For example, if the Raksha has Assumption of Water Shape active, she can grant the Creation-born the power to breathe and move freely underwater. If her Assumption carries the innate power associated with the Undetectable Lie Charm, she can grant that innate power to him, but he would be able to use that power only if he were capable of spending Essence, since each use of that innate power costs five motes. Conferring such a benefit costs the Raksha one point of gossamer per mutation point in the case of conferred mutation benefits or a number of gossamer points equal to the gossamer cost of the Charm for any Charm benefits shared. In the case of the Raksha with Assumption of Water Shape active, the Raksha must spend one point of gossamer to confer the benefits of Assumption of Water Shape on the Creation-born (the gossamer cost of Assumption of Water Shape). In the case of the Undetectable Lie innate power, the Raksha must spend three gossamer (the gossamer cost of that Charm).
   The Raksha can withdraw any conferred gifts at any time as a reflexive action. If the Raksha leaves the creature's presence, the effects of any benefits conferred still continue until withdrawn. In addition to its use as an Assumption Charm, this Charm can also be taken as a transitory mutation. The Raksha must spend one gossamer in conjunction with some other Assumption Charm to gain the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp, 1+g): The Raksha can taint a Creation-born she encounters while in Creation, granting him the benefits of a mutation or innate power she currently has active. The gossamer cost of tainting a Creation-born is calculated in the same manner as the Assumption aspect of this Charm. The Creation-born retains the granted power for one day. At the end of the day, the Creation-born's player must roll his character's Willpower against a difficulty equal to the number of gossamer spent on the power to resist Wyld addiction. This power does not allow the Raksha to dematerialize, nor does it grant any automatic successes on social rolls against the affected Creation-born.
   Glamour Resistance: The Raksha cannot use this Charm to taint any creature whose (Stamina + Essence) exceeds her Charisma.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: This Charm is seldom used as the physical component for an oneiromancy spell, but it can be incorporated into a spell designed to affect specific individuals.</description>

If the raksha has taken this Charm as a permanent Charm and the person she has bound herself to dies or otherwise manages to render himself an invalid target for this Charm, the raksha may assign it to a new individual for a cost of one gossamer. She may only do this if she loses her current host; she may not otherwise change hosts at will. Unlike most Assumption Charms, this Charm may be activated in Creation; ignore the detailed Innate Power. Raksha may share the effects of currently active Charms that enhance themselves with their hosts, such as the benefits of an Assumption, or mutations gained through Fantastic Grotesquerie Shell.
   If the raksha already wears an active Assumption, the cost of this Charm becomes 5m, 1g. Assumption of the Person's Heart may be learned as a permanent Charm, but Raksha who learn it in this fashion are permanently incapable of passing back through the Gateway of Sundraprisha and becoming unshaped once again.</errText>

The Assumption Charm (or Charms) deployed by a raksha may influence the form she takes in Creation, but any alterations to her appearance are purely cosmetic absent the application of mutations or other Charms. These Charms are Stackable in that a raksha can activate as many Assumptions simultaneously as she can afford.

                <errText>A raksha may simultaneously wear multiple Assumption Charms, but this does not render them Stackable, as they are technically separate Charms. Raksha who have multiple active Assumptions may not selectively choose which to manifest - she wears all her active forms at once. She is a sentient stain on a city, and a person strolling through it. A raksha made of fire and joy may not switch between being made of joy and being made of fire - she is a raksha made of fire and joy, at all times. Raksha who have taken an Assumption as a permanent Charm may still activate additional Assumptions, modifying their permanent body thereby. Thus, a raksha with a permanent Assumption of Fire Shape may also wear an Assumption of Water Shape or Assumption of Cerements and Bone, permitting her to one day appear as a raksha of steam, the next as a raksha of pyre-flame. She must always be a raksha wearing an Assumption of Fire to at least some degree, however - such is the price of becoming a permanent being of shape.
   The Essence cost of Assumption Charms must be committed while they remain active, as normal. Raksha who do not wish to pay this onerous Essence burden may learn an Assumption as a permanent Charm with no associated Essence cost... but in doing so they irreversibly render themselves shaped beings, becoming that which the unshaped of the deep Wyld hate above all else. Raksha may learn no more than one Assumption as a permanent Charm.</errText>

        <description>This Charm allows the Raksha to transform himself into a subtle Wyld taint that infects an entire region of Creation. When activated as an Assumption Charm (at a cost of 10 motes and two gossamer), the Raksha distills his being into a small physical object that contains his Heart Grace. The object can then be transported into Creation by another, and while there, the Heart Grace can perform a series of preprogrammed glamour effects that can affect everyone within the region covered by the taint. For example, the Heart Grace might be programmed to maintain the Fearsome Mien Charm (see p. 214) to perpetually frighten away everyone in the area or the Beguilement Charm (see pp. 206-207) to maintain a specific delusion among the inhabitants of the region. The Raksha must know the Charm to be incorporated into the Heart Grace's programming and must pay any necessary costs to incorporate such Charms into the Assumption.
   The area that can be affected by the Heart Grace is a small area, such as a tiny village of up to 25 people in size. The Raksha's entire Essence diffuses across the affected area, and any rolls made by the Heart Grace apply against every valid target within that area. While the Assumption endures, the Raksha himself exists as an immaterial spirit-like being diffused across the affected area. He cannot be perceived or harmed except through appropriate magical powers.
   The disadvantage of using this Charm is that, while the Raksha is immaterial and separated from his Heart Grace, he is devoid of self-motivation. The Raksha cannot spend Willpower, nor can he initiate any action other than to protect himself, to answer questions put to him or to perform rote tasks. He cannot initiate any new actions. A Raksha who activates this Assumption Charm and another one simultaneously can maintain a separate physical form. While wearing that form, the Raksha still cannot spend Willpower but otherwise suffers none of the normal penalties of Assumption of the Land's Heart.
   Detecting a Wyld taint on an area requires a successful difficulty 3 (Perception + Occult) roll. Actually finding the hidden Heart Grace requires a successful difficulty 5 (Perception + Occult) roll. Charms such as All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight (see Exalted, p. 222) allow automatic success on such rolls. In addition to its benefits as an Assumption Charm, Assumption of the Land's Heart can be used as a Mutation Charm. By spending two gossamer in conjunction with a different Assumption Charm, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp): This power allows the Raksha to gain the benefits of the Assumption aspect of this Charm even if he did not spend the full cost before entering Creation. In this way, the Raksha can travel to the area he seeks to taint and inflict the effects of Assumption of the Land's Heart on it without the need for a third party to carry his Heart Grace to the desired area. This innate power, once activated, otherwise functions exactly like the Assumption Charm.
   Glamour Resistance: None. Creatures within the affected area resist preprogrammed glamour effects as normal for each effect.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: Usually incorporated into a higher level oneiromancy spell along with Assumption of (Element) Shape, this Charm allows the spell to affect mortals in a large area that fits within the normal range parameters of the Charm.</description>

This Charm functions exactly like Assumption of the City's Heart except that the affected area must share a border with the Bordermarches on at least 20 percent of its boundary. In addition to the normal effects of Assumption of the City's Heart, this Charm also creates a powerful tainted land. Any Raksha can attempt shaping magic within that area of Creation, albeit at a +5 difficulty.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: As per Assumption of the Land's Heart.</description>

            <errText>Unlike most Assumption Charms, this Charm may be activated in Creation; ignore the detailed Innate Power. If the raksha already wears an active Assumption, the cost of this Charm becomes 10m, 6g. Assumption of the Wyld-Tainted Land may be learned as a permanent Charm, but Raksha who learn it in this fashion are permanently incapable of passing back through the Gateway of Sundraprisha and becoming unshaped once again.</errText>

            <description>These Charms govern the circumstances by which a raksha enters Creation or some other shaped realm. Only a raksha who has already shaped an identity for herself through the Gateway of Sundraprisha Charm is capable of then refining that body through an Assumption Charm. In other words, unshaped raksha can never use Assumption Charms while still remaining unshaped, although unshaped can learn Assumption Charms and frequently use them in crafting oneiromantic effects and other such phenomena. The Assumption Charm (or Charms) deployed by a raksha may influence the form she takes in Creation, but any alterations to her appearance are purely cosmetic absent the application of mutations or other Charms. These Charms are Stackable in that a raksha can activate as many Assumptions simultaneously as she can afford. A raksha who carries multiple active Assumptions can choose the form in which she appears from all the choices her active Assumption Charms give her. The magical benefits of all of her active Assumption Charms are constantly available.</description>

                <errText>A raksha may simultaneously wear multiple Assumption Charms, but this does not render them Stackable, as they are technically separate Charms. Raksha who have multiple active Assumptions may not selectively choose which to manifest - she wears all her active forms at once. She is a sentient stain on a city, and a person strolling through it. A raksha made of fire and joy may not switch between being made of joy and being made of fire - she is a raksha made of fire and joy, at all times. Raksha who have taken an Assumption as a permanent Charm may still activate additional Assumptions, modifying their permanent body thereby. Thus, a raksha with a permanent Assumption of Fire Shape may also wear an Assumption of Water Shape or Assumption of Cerements and Bone, permitting her to one day appear as a raksha of steam, the next as a raksha of pyre-flame. She must always be a raksha wearing an Assumption of Fire to at least some degree, however - such is the price of becoming a permanent being of shape.
   The Essence cost of Assumption Charms must be committed while they remain active, as normal. Raksha who do not wish to pay this onerous Essence burden may learn an Assumption as a permanent Charm with no associated Essence cost... but in doing so they irreversibly render themselves shaped beings, becoming that which the unshaped of the deep Wyld hate above all else. Raksha may learn no more than one Assumption as a permanent Charm.</errText>

        <description>This Charm blurs the line between creation and the Wyld, between reality and dream. Acquiring this Charm permanently increases the cost for all Assumption Charms by two gossamer (or two mutation points for permanent Assumptions). The Raksha can pass through Nirakara in a quasi-Wyld form. Essentially, he exists in Creation without an Assumption and without being annihilated by reality's basilisk gaze. The Raksha can enter Creation as a formless being, but he still resists calcification as if he carried an active Assumption.
   This Charm permanently adds one to the difficulty of all Charms and shaping actions by others that alter the Raksha's body in any way. It also causes the Charms and powers of Creation-born to treat the Raksha as an automaton and as a creature outside fate, thereby rendering him immune to most direct mental influence and destiny-shaping effects. Oneiromancy spells that incorporate the permanent version of this Charm are immune to all countermagic effects below Celestial Circle sorcery. The Raksha remains vulnerable to powers that can somehow bind the Raksha into Creation wholesale. Two such powers are the Greater Sign of Jupiter (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Sidereals, p. 211) and Harmony with Reality Technique (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Lunars, p. 187).

Mad God Mien inflicts a -1 external penalty on all attempts by the Creation-born to use Shaping effects upon the raksha, not including shaping actions produced by the Graces. The raksha is also considered a being outside of fate, although this Charm fails in the face of Charms or other magic designed to force beings outside of fate back within its confines.

        <description>the Raksha Can Draw Upon The Elements Of Creation In conjunction with the inherent properties of Raksha narrative magic. When a Raksha spends one gossamer to activate this Charm in conjunction with Assumption of Elemental Shape, he gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m, Speed: 5): The Raksha can reflexively spend one mote to grant a one-die Wyld bonus to any single action, whether undertaken by himself or anyone within his presence. Two conditions must be met. First, the Raksha must be able to define how he is using the appropriate element to assist him. Second, he must have the Assumption of (Element) Shape Charm appropriate to that element active. For example, if the Raksha were using Assumption of Earth Shape and were preparing to fire an arrow, he might "bond himself with the ground for balance". Later, if he wished to help one Creation-born seduce another, he might seek to manipulate events so that one of the two tripped over a loose stone and fell romantically into the other's arms.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. When the Raksha uses this Charm to influence actions he undertakes himself, there is no Glamour Resistance.When he uses it to assist an action undertaken by a Creation-born, the Charm fails if the targeted mortal's (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>This Charm ingratiates the Raksha's chosen form with the elemental architecture across which all of Creation is draped. The Raksha's deceptive shape is so cunningly designed to emulate the elemental form that the element that has been copied responds to the Raksha's will. The Raksha must spend one gossamer to activate this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption of (Element) Shape. Doing so confers the following innate power on the Raksha:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m; Speed: 6): The Raksha can 223sculpt" the element with which she is aligned as if it were clay through a (Wits + Craft) roll. Used in conjunction with Assumption of Air Shape, Fire Shape or Water Shape, the Raksha can shape any of those materials into a solid form that will hold its new shape for one lunar cycle. Used in conjunction with Assumption of Earth Shape or Wood Shape, the Raksha can shape anything made of earth or metal or anything made of wood as if he had First Age tools, even if he's working barehanded. The actual presence of such tools reduces the difficulty of the craftworking by one. This power allows a Raksha to manipulate the appearance and form of an elemental of the appropriate element, but only if that elemental is not capable of Glamour Resistance.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot affect an elemental material that is currently in the possession of a Creation-born whose (Integrity + Essence) is greater than the Raksha's Wits. It cannot affect a Creation-born elemental whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Craft.</description>

The raksha's deceptive shape is so cunningly designed to emulate the elemental form that the element that has been copied responds to the raksha's will. She may "sculpt" the element with which she is aligned as if it were clay using a standard Craft roll, paying two motes per Crafting roll to do so. Sculpted air, fire or water gains a solid form that will hold its shape for one lunar cycle. Wood and Earth may be worked without tools with no penalty; the presence of such tools adds two dice to all crafting efforts (these count as dice added by a Charm). This Charm also allows a raksha to modify the appearance of an elemental of the appropriate element, sculpting its features with her bare hands. Objects owned by Creation-born with higher Essence than the raksha cannot be sculpted without the owner's consent, nor may cold iron. With Essence 4+, sculpted air, fire and water may retain their new shape indefinitely.</description>

        <description>The Raksha summons into Creation a possession that otherwise could not exist there. The form of this summoned possession is elemental in character and must be based upon the element associated with whichever Assumption of (Element) Shape Charm the Raksha has active. For example, a Raksha wearing the Assumption of Air Shape who summoned forth a hazard might fashion it into a lightning storm or a blizzard, while one who bore the Assumption of Wood Shape might call forth a sudden growth of ambulatory carnivorous plants.</description>

        <description>When the Raksha enters Creation in the guise of a creature of the elements, this Charm can be used in conjunction with the Assumption Charm to grant her the following innate ability for the duration of her narrative:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha reaches out with his stolen elemental form, turning the very foundations of Creation against their inhabitants. By activating this power, the Raksha can inflict an internal environmental penalty equal to his Essence against a single action he witnesses in Creation. The Raksha's player must be able to define how the element he has assumed is able to impose the penalty under the circumstances at hand. This power is reflexive.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour and cannot be used to hinder a Creation-born whose (Dexterity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's elemental disguise nears perfection. She is now so fully attuned to the element she has assumed that she can call upon it to attack her enemies in Creation. Activating this Charm confers upon the Raksha an innate attack power appropriate to the element she has assumed. For each attack, the Raksha must have access to a suitable quantity of the element to form the attack. If the element is not present in sufficient quantities, however, the Raksha can summon hostile elemental conditions into existence at a cost of one gossamer per attack. Because the Raksha simply uses this gossamer to alter the material of Creation and then direct it against another, this attack never invokes Glamour Resistance. The resulting attacks are always considered non-magical environmental damage for purposes of Charms that resist such damage.
   Each of these attacks is unblockable and undodgeable except through a Charm or a stunt. Each of these attacks has a cost of five motes and a Speed of 5. The base lethal damage for all attacks is equal to twice the Raksha's Essence.
   Innate Power (Air): The Raksha can call down lightning, hail, icy wind or any other deadly environmental effect appropriate to the element of Air. This attack normally requires serious inclement weather - a thunderstorm, a blizzard, a hurricane, etc. - and the Raksha must be above ground and outdoors. During calm weather or while inside or underground, the Raksha can launch the attack at a cost of one gossamer. The attack's Accuracy is equal to the Raksha's (Dexterity + Archery) dice pool. The Raksha must be within 500 yards of the target and able to see it.
   Innate Power (Earth): The earth itself rises up against the enemies of the Fair Folk. The Raksha can cause stones to fling themselves at the target, inflicting twice her Essence in damage. The attack's Accuracy is equal to the Raksha's (Dexterity + Martial Arts), with a range of 500 yards. This power also has a secondary attack. With just one success on a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll, the Raksha can cause the ground to shake within a radius of 30 yards. The player of anyone standing within that area must roll (Dexterity + Athletics) successfully against a difficulty equal to the Raksha's successes as a normal action or have their characters knocked prone. Structures take the Raksha's Essence in lethal damage. Neither of these effects can be activated unless the Raksha is standing on solid ground, and targets farther than five yards from the ground (at sea, in the air, hanging from a tree) are immune to both of these attacks. With the expenditure of one gossamer, however, the Raksha can create stones from nothing and hurl them against targets otherwise protected from this power.
   Innate Power (Fire): The Raksha can cause any ambient flame to leap toward an enemy. The target must be within five yards of a significant blaze. The attack's Accuracy is equal to the Raksha's (Dexterity + Archery) dice pool. If no fire is handy, the Raksha can spend one gossamer to summon a fire into existence and launch it toward his target. The Raksha must be within 100 yards of the target and able to see it.
   Innate Power (Water): The Raksha can cause the ocean, the sea, a river or any sufficiently large quantity of water to rise up against his enemy like a crushing wave. The target must be within five yards of water. The attack's Accuracy is equal to the Raksha's (Dexterity + Martial Arts) dice pool. The Raksha must be within 100 yards of the target and be able to see it. If the target is not near a sufficiently large body of water, the Raksha can spend one gossamer to create a quantity of water in order to make the attack.
   Innate Power (Wood): The Raksha can turn a whole forest against his adversary. The target must be within five yards of a tree or within 30 yards of any small wooden object. Trees can grapple the target, while smaller objects leap at her, either inflicting attacks with the Raksha's (Dexterity + Martial Arts) pool. For grappling attacks, trees use the Raksha's normal Strength. If no appropriate plant life is available, the Raksha can cause suitable plants to spring from the ground at a cost of one gossamer. The attack has an Accuracy equal to the Raksha's (Dexterity + Martial Arts) and has a range of 100 yards.</description>

            <description>The raksha's elemental disguise nears perfection. She is now so fully attuned to the element she has assumed that she can call upon it to attack her enemies in Creation. This Charm may be used in a varying fashion, based on which elemental Assumptions the raksha is wearing. These attacks are considered environmental hazards and fail to harm characters protected from such threats. They normally cost five motes if there is a sufficient quantity of the appropriate element present to manipulate. If an insufficient quantity is present, the raksha may conjure up the element by adding one gossamer to the Charm's cost.
   Air: The raksha directs howling winds, lightning bolts, or freezing hail to slay an opponent. She makes a (Dexterity + [Archery or Survival]) attack, targeted at a character she can perceive within 100 yards of either herself or an air-based environmental hazard; this attack is undodgeable, with a base damasage of 5L. If no appropriate hazard is present, the raksha may pay one gossamer to create and hurl lightning at an opponent within 100 yards.
   Earth: The Charm may be used in one of two ways. First, the raksha may cause the earth to shake. All characters standing on the ground within 30 yards must roll (Dexterity + Athletics) against a difficulty of the raksha's Essence or be knocked prone. Alternately, the raksha may tear stones from the ground and hurl them at characters within 100 yards. These attacks are made with (Dexterity + [Martial Arts or Survival]) and are unblockable, with a base damage of 8B. If the raksha is not within five yards of the ground, she may conjure stone and hurl it for a one gossamer surcharge.
   Fire: The raksha may strike at any character she may perceive within 100 yards of a significant degree of flame. This attack uses a pool of ([Dexterity or Wits] + [Archery or Craft]), with a base damage of 10L. If sufficient fire is not available, she may conjure it in order to attack a target within 100 yards for a one gossamer surcharge.
   Water: The raksha may cause the ocean, a river, a lake, or any similarly large quantity of water to rise up against his enemy as a crushing wave. The target must be within 20 yards of the water. This attack is unblockable or undodgeable at the raksha's discretion, uses an attack pool of (Stamina + [Thrown or Sail]) with a base damage of 0B, and automatically inflicts 10 yards of knockback and knockdown if it strikes. If there is no sufficient quantity of water present, the raksha may spend one gossamer to conjure a wave with which to strike at a target within 100 yards.
   Wood: The raksha can turn a whole forest against her adversary. The target must be within 30 yards of a tree or other large plant. This attack is made with the raksha's (Strength + [Martial Arts or Survival]), has a base damage of 5B, and acts as a successful Blockade Movement action if it strikes, preventing the target from moving in any direction until the raksha's DV refreshes. If no suitable foliage is in range, the raksha may summon plants to attack a target within 100 yards for a one gossamer surcharge.</description>

        <description>Some Raksha are accomplished shapeshifters though their skills are inferior to the Lunar Exalted (at least while in Creation). Activating this Charm in conjunction with Assumption of (Element) Shape grants the Raksha the innate ability to transform into a form resembling an elemental of Creation. The Raksha can purchase this Charm multiple times to allow the transmutation into additional elemental forms. This Charm confers the following innate ability for the duration of the Raksha's time in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp; Speed: 5): The Raksha can assume a form Creation-born might easily mistake for a true elemental, although deities and savants will typically know better. The specific form is chosen when this Charm is purchased. Regardless of its appearance, the Raksha's player has (Essence + 3) mutation points to spend on this secondary form. Typically, a Raksha exposed to cold iron while in his altered shape is instantly forced back to his true form. Some advanced oneiromancy spells permit such effects to survive contact with cold iron.
   Although technically a work of glamour, this Charm affects only the Raksha's own body and does not provoke Glamour Resistance. The mutation points acquired through this power do not count toward the Raksha's (Essence + mutation point) total.</description>

            <description>Some raksha are accomplished shapeshifters, though their skills are inferior to the Lunar Exalted (at least while in Creation). Activating this Charm allows the raksha to disguise herself as an elemental corresponding to an element she has as an active Assumption. The raksha defines her precise elemental appearance anew each time she activates this Charm. The raksha gains (Essence + 3) points of mutations with which to garnish this form. Contact with cold iron dispels this Charm instantly.
   This disguise is perfect in the eyes of all characters with an Occult rating less than 4; if given cause to suspect the raksha is not what she seems, characters with sufficiently high Occult may make a (Perception + Occult) roll at a difficulty of the raksha's Heart in order to identify her for what she is.
   Oneiromantic Benefit: This Charm may only be incorporated into inward-facing dreams.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's control over his elemental form is such that he can reflexively alter it as needed to achieve his goals. If activated by a Raksha using Assumption of (Element) Shape, the Fair Folk acquires the following innate ability:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): With but a thought, the Raksha can make some minor change to his elemental form sufficient to grant him a two-die Wyld bonus. The player must define what sort of change is made to acquire this bonus. He might surround himself with a swirling column of air to aid in jumping or movement. He might develop stretchable watery arms to facilitate a Larceny roll. He might become able to pass through underbrush without disturbing it to throw off pursuers. The effect lasts as long as the Raksha continues to pursue the same action for which he activated this power, which might be a single dice roll or a months-long pursuit. The Raksha need only describe the changes wrought by this power in terms of elemental traits in general. The potential traits are limited to the characteristics of the element with which he has associated his Assumption of (Element) Shape Charm.
   Because this power affects only the Raksha himself, it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

            <description>The raksha's control over his elemental form is such that he can reflexively alter it as needed to achieve his goals. For each three motes committed to Mercurial Elemental Shape, the raksha may add one die to all rolls to facilitate a certain sort of action. The raksha's player must define what sort of change is made to acquire this bonus. He might surround himself with a swirling column of air to aid in jumping or movement, or develop stretchable watery limbs to facilitate a Larceny roll. He might become able to pass through underbrush without disturbing it to sneak up on his targets. The effect lasts as long as the raksha commits Essence to this Charm, but may only apply to one specific sort of action (Melee-based attack rolls, Survival rolls to track prey, Dodge attempts, and so on) with the breadth of a specialty. This Charm may be activated multiple times in order to facilitate different sorts of simultaneous enhanced activity. Being touched by cold iron causes this Charm to terminate itself.</description>

        <description>The Raksha can call upon the beasts of Creation in conjunction with the inherent properties of Raksha narrative magic. The Raksha invokes this Charm when he enters Creation through Assumption of Bestial Visage, thereby gaining the following innate power to call upon the traits of his animalistic nature to aid him in some minor way in his endeavors:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m, Speed: 5): For the duration of the story, the Raksha can reflexively spend one mote to grant a one-die Wyld bonus to any single action, whether undertaken by himself or anyone within his presence. Two conditions must be met. First, the Raksha must be able to describe how the action is benefited by the characteristics of a particular animal. Second, he must have the Assumption of Bestial Visage Charm appropriate to that animal active. For example, if the Raksha were using Assumption of Bestial Visage (Lion) and was preparing to engage in battle, he might roar like a mighty beast to intimidate his enemies. Later, if he wished to give encouragement to shy Creation-born, he might try to inspire him with the majestic solemnity of his leonine form.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. When the Raksha uses this Charm to influence actions he undertakes himself, there is no Glamour Resistance. When he uses it to assist an action undertaken by a Creation-born, the Charm fails if the targeted mortal's (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>Some Raksha are accomplished shapeshifters, though their skills are inferior to the Lunar Exalted (at least in Creation). Activating this Charm in conjunction with Assumption of Bestial Visage grants the Raksha the innate ability to transform into a perfect copy of the animal with which the Raksha has associated her Assumption of Bestial Visage Charm. The Raksha can purchase this Charm multiple times to allow transmutation into additional forms. While wearing an animal form, the Raksha can communicate freely with animals of that type, as well as with humans and other intelligent creatures. This Charm confers the following innate ability for the duration of the Raksha's time in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp; Speed: 5): The Raksha can change his shape into that of a particular animal. The specific animal is chosen when this Charm is purchased and must be appropriate to the Raksha's Assumption of Bestial Visage Charm. The Raksha's player has (Essence + 3) mutation points to spend on this secondary form. Typically, a Raksha exposed to cold iron while in his altered shape is instantly forced back to his true form. Some advanced oneiromancy spells permit such effects to survive contact with cold iron.
   Although technically a work of glamour, this Charm affects only the Raksha's own body and does not provoke Glamour Resistance. The mutation points acquired through this power do not count toward the Raksha's (Essence + mutation point) total.</description>

            <errText>This Charm functions as Elemental Transformation, save that the raksha disguises himself as the animal his Bestial Visage is based on, rather than as an elemental. He may speak in any language he knows while wearing this form. He also gains the permanent ability to communicate with animals of the type his Bestial Visage is based on. Survival replaces Occult as the Ability needed to pierce the raksha's disguise.
   Oneiromancy Benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into inward-facing dreams for two points, or outward-facing glamours for three points. Outward-facing glamours transform characters who undertake a certain sort of action specified during the creation of the spell into animals for one day per dot of the lorekeeper’s Essence.</errText>

        <description>The Raksha's control over his bestial form is such that he can reflexively alter it as needed to achieve his goals. If activated in tandem with Assumption of Bestial Visage, the Raksha acquires the following innate ability:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m; Speed: 5): With but a thought, the Raksha can make some minor change to his bestial form sufficient to grant him a +2 internal Wyld bonus. The player must define what sort of change is made to acquire this bonus. He might grow claws to aid in combat. He might acquire prehensile fingers to help with climbing. His eyes might change to those of a cat or hawk to facilitate Awareness rolls. The effect lasts as long as the Raksha continues to pursue the same action for which he activated this power, which might be a single dice roll or a months-long pursuit. The Raksha need only describe the changes wrought by this power in terms of animal traits in general. The potential traits are not limited to the characteristics of the animal with which he has associated his Assumption of Bestial Visage Charm.
   Because this power affects only the Raksha himself, it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha reaches out to the beasts of Creation, turning them against the mortals in their midst. By activating this power, the Raksha can inflict an environmental penalty equal to his Essence against a single action he witnesses in Creation. The Raksha's player must be able to define how some animal in the vicinity disrupts the planned action. This power is reflexive.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour and cannot be used to hinder a Creation-born whose (Dexterity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation. Likewise, the Raksha cannot call upon the aid of an intelligent animal whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>The Raksha is now nearly one with Creation's animal kingdom. She is so fully attuned to Creation's animal life that she can call upon it to attack her enemies. Activating this Charm along with the Assumption confers upon the Raksha the following innate attack power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m; Speed: 5): The Raksha can create an environmental hazard in the form of some kind of animal attack. This might range from an attack by wild dogs to a swarm of killer bees to a plague of rats. Regardless, the attack has an Accuracy equal to the Raksha's (Dexterity + Martial Arts). The summoned animals are not "real" enough to defend against normally, but stunts or Charms totally protect the victim from the effects. Against affected Creation-born, this power inflicts a base lethal damage equal to twice the Raksha's Essence. The attack's range is 100 yards.
   Glamour Resistance: This power represents a work of glamour that cannot harm a Creation-born whose (Stamina + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Dexterity.</description>

Unless specifically stated otherwise, the raksha must have a version of Assumption of Bestial Visage active in order to use any of these Charms, and any bestial effects invoked by them must be associated with the animalistic shape the raksha has assumed.</description>

        <description>This Charm functions as per Elemental Evocation (see Graceful Wicked Masques, pp. 162-163), except that the summoned possession, rather than having an elemental aspect, instead carries a bestial one. For example, conjured armor might be decorated with wolf pelts or braced with antlers, or a summoned dagger might take the form of a tyrant lizard's fang affixed to a bone hilt.</description>

        <description>The Raksha can use the emotion she symbolizes to bolster her own aims or to inspire (or terrify) others. Upon entering Creation and assuming an emotional resonance, the Raksha can use this Charm to give herself the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m): The Raksha can reflexively grant a two-die bonus on any action she takes consistent with the emotion or belief she has assumed. A seductress of love, for example, can gain a two-die bonus to her Socialize rolls to influence besotted lovers, while the Cataphract of fear might gain a two-die bonus on Presence rolls to frighten away challengers. The Raksha can also grant a similar benefit to any action performed by another she witnesses, subject to the limitations of Glamour Resistance.
   Glamour Resistance: This power is a work of glamour. When used to confer an emotional bonus on a Creation-born, the power fails if the recipient's (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Charisma.</description>

        <description>Having become the personification of an emotion, the Raksha can now forcefully instill that emotion into the very souls of those pitiful mortals who cross his path. This Charm, when activated in conjunction with Assumption of Dreams and Passion, grants the Raksha the following innate ability:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m, 1wp; Speed: 5 [or 3 long ticks in social combat]): This power permits the Raksha to redefine the Motivation of a shaped being. The Raksha's player must roll (Manipulation + Presence) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. If the roll is successful, the Raksha can redefine the target's Motivation for up to one season. The effect ends automatically if the Raksha leaves Creation and terminates Assumption of Dreams and Passions or when the Raksha is slain.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect the Motivation of any Creation-born whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

            <description>Having become the personification of an emotion, the raksha can now forcefully instill that emotion into the very souls of those pitiful mortals who cross his path. The raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Presence) against a mortal target's MDV. If successful, he may redefine the target's Motivation to his liking. This altered Motivation reverts to normal after one story. This unnatural mental influence may be resisted by spending two points of Willpower in the Wyld, or one in Creation. Characters with cold iron touching their skin are immune to Emotion-Weaving Style.
   If the raksha has Assumption of Cerements and Bone active, he may also redefine the Motivation of ghosts. With Essence 5+ the raksha may alter the Motivation any unExalted human. Essence 7+ permits the Motivations of spirits to be rewritten.
   Oneiromantic Benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into outward-facing glamours, causing mortals to adopt a certain motivation decided upon at the time of the spell's creation if they take a certain action specified at the time of the spell's creation.</description>

        <description>This Charm functions as per Elemental Evocation (see pp. 162-163), except that the summoned possession, rather than having an elemental aspect, instead carries an emotional one. For example, a warrior of rage and a temptress of lust might each summon forth a suit of armor or a pet dog. For the warrior, the armor would be appropriately terrifying and the dog would be a slathering, enraged mastiff. For the temptress, the armor might be fashioned of delicate, pink adamant, while the dog would be an adorable lap dog fit for a boudoir.</description>

        <description>The power of the emotion or belief by which the Raksha defines himself in Creation can overpower those who come into his orbit. This Charm, used in conjunction with Assumption of Dreams and Passion, grants the Raksha access to the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): By unleashing the emotion at the core of his assumed form into Creation, the Raksha can reflexively impose an internal penalty equal to his Essence on a single witnessed action of which he disapproves. The Raksha's player must define how the emotion the character has assumed can logically result in the penalty to be inflicted. If the Raksha has used this Assumption to disguise himself as another, this power instead inflicts an internal penalty on all rolls to penetrate the Raksha's disguise for the duration of a scene.
   Glamour Resistance: This power is a work of glamour and cannot affect Creation-born whose (Temperance + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>As the Raksha focuses the intensity of the emotion or belief she symbolizes onto a single target, she finds she can direct that intensity past her target's mind and soul into the very Essence pattern that defines him. This Charm, activated in conjunction with Assumption of Dreams and Passions, confers the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m); The Raksha can direct the white-hot core of her emotional nature directly into the Essence that defines her target. The Raksha's player must roll (Manipulation + Performance) against the target's Dodge MDV. If the Raksha succeeds, the target loses motes of Essence equal to the Raksha's Essence plus her extra successes on the attack. The target also suffers a -1 internal penalty on all actions for the rest of the scene as the emotion the Raksha represents overcomes him. This penalty can stack with Unwanted Obsession Provocation Technique, but not with itself.
   Glamour Resistance: This power is a work of glamour that cannot affect a Creation-born whose (Occult + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Charisma.</description>

        <description>This Charm functions as per Elemental Evocation (see Graceful Wicked Masques, pp. 162-163), except that the summoned possession, rather than having an elemental aspect, instead carries a deathly one. For example, conjured armor might be decorated with skulls and fluttering cerecloth, or a summoned chair might be made of pale reeds and adorned with bones.</description>

        <description>Suffusing her body with plasmic glamour, the raksha momentarily takes on the consistency of gauzy mist. This allows her to step through a non-airtight barrier no more than (Essence) yards thick, though she may pass through the barrier no faster than half her Move rate, rounded up. The raksha must navigate herself carefully through a stationary obstacle to avoid tearing her body in a harmful fashion, and so this Charm is not useful to evade attacks or Blockade Movement actions.</description>

        <description>This Excellency permits a Raksha to augment the traits by which he defines himself for purposes of facilitating a shaping action or defending against one. There are five of these Excellencies - one for each of the four Graces associated with shaping actions and one associated with the Heart Grace, which is used for defensive purposes.
   When a Raksha's player makes a shaping combat roll, he can have the Raksha activate the First Excellency associated with the Grace that governs that type of shaping combat (Cup-, Ring-, Staff- or Sword-shaping). This Charm adds one die to the shaping roll per mote spent. The Raksha cannot spend more motes on this Charm than (the relevant Grace + Essence). The Raksha's player can also add dice to a Join Shaping Battle roll if the Raksha has the First Grace Excellency appropriate to his feeding Grace (or Graces).
   If the Raksha wishes to improve his parry defense to a shaping attack, he can also use the First (Grace) Excellency. For every mote spent (up to the maximum of [Grace + Essence]), the Raksha's player rolls one die. Each success on this reflexive roll adds one to the Raksha's Parry Shaping DV against the incoming shaping attack.
   The First Heart Excellency works differently. For every mote spent (up to the maximum of the Heart Grace), the Raksha's player rolls one die, with each success adding one to the Raksha's Dodge Shaping DV. A Raksha with the First Heart Excellency can also use it to increase his shaping soak. For every mote spent (up to the maximum of the Grace), the Raksha's player rolls one die, with each success adding one to the Raksha's shaping soak.</description>

        <description>This Excellency permits a Raksha to perfect the traits by which he defines himself for purposes of facilitating a shaping attack or defending against one. There are five of these Excellencies - one for each of the four Graces associated with shaping actions and one associated with the Heart Grace, which is used for defensive purposes.
   When a Raksha's player makes a shaping combat roll, he can have his character spend two motes to gain an automatic success on the shaping roll. The Raksha must have the appropriate Charm for the type of shaping attack he is making (Cup-, Ring-, Staff- or Sword-shaping), and he cannot spend more motes on this Charm than (the relevant Grace + Essence). Fractional motes spent on this Charm are lost. The Raksha can also gain automatic successes on a Join Shaping Battle roll if he has the Second Grace Excellency appropriate to his feeding Grace (or Graces).
   If the Raksha wishes to improve his defense to a shaping attack, he can use the Second Grace Excellency. For every two motes spent (up to the maximum of the Grace), the Raksha increases the Raksha's Parry Shaping DV against an incoming shaping attack by one.
   The Second Heart Excellency works differently. For every two motes spent (up to the maximum of the Grace), the Raksha increases his Dodge Shaping DV against an incoming shaping attack by one. A Raksha with the Second Heart Excellency can also use it to increase his shaping soak. For every two motes spent (up to the maximum of the Grace), the Raksha increases her shaping soak by one.</description>

        <description>The Third (Grace) Excellency can save the Raksha from disaster by permitting his player to reroll a failed shaping action or attack roll. There are five of these Excellencies - one for each of the four Graces associated with shaping actions and one associated with the Heart Grace, which is used for defensive purposes. The Raksha can activate this Charm after his player makes a shaping roll associated with the relevant Grace. This Charm allows the Raksha's player to make the roll again and take the result she prefers. The Raksha's player can also reroll a Join Shaping Battle roll if the Raksha has the Third Grace Excellency appropriate to either of her feeding Graces, but the player can reroll a Join Shaping Battle roll only once.
   The Raksha can also improve her defense to a shaping attack with the Third (Grace) Excellency. At a cost of four motes, the Raksha can add ([Grace] / 2) directly to Parry Shaping DV against shaping attacks.
   The First Heart Excellency works somewhat differently. At a cost of four motes, the Raksha can add the value of half his Heart Grace to his Dodge Shaping DV. He can also spend four motes to add the value of half his Heart Grace to his shaping soak.</description>

        <description>Raksha covet hoards of gossamer, while mortals want for precious jade. If they desire riches in their hearts, how can any merciful faerie deny them? Upon using this Charm, the raksha enchants a single object he can perceive, rolling (Manipulation + Performance). The object's appearance does not actually change; instead, those who see it believe it to be valuable beyond all price. All characters who see the enchanted treasure and who have a Dodge MDV lower than the raksha's rolled successes covet it greatly. They suffer a -3 penalty to the MDVs against any mental influence that exploits their desire for it.
   In addition, they are compelled to attempt to acquire it so long as they can see it, though this Compulsion cannot change the nature of men. An honest man cannot be turned to a thief by this influence - unless he chooses to steal it of his own free will, this influence will only compel him to attempt to buy or otherwise legitimately obtain the treasure. A character may pay two points of Willpower to resist this influence, rendering them immune to all such enchantments laid by the raksha for one day. If the raksha ends this Charm, all characters are freed from its unnatural mental influence. Furthermore, should the enchanted item be touched with cold iron, this Charm is terminated.</description>

        <description>For Raksha who have this Charm active when they enter bedlam, the chaotic Wyld energies invoked by the experience are filtered through the lens of the Raksha's Compassion. The Raksha can activate this Charm in the Wyld at any point before he enters bedlam, thereby gaining the benefits of the following innate power for the duration of the tale. Alternatively, he can spend one gossamer to activate this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption to gain the following innate power for the duration of the Assumption:
   Innate Power (Cost: 8m): As the Raksha enters bedlam, he can spend eight motes as a reflexive action. For the duration of the bedlam, the Raksha becomes a creature of angelic beauty who radiates glory (despite her transparent madness). Any character who wishes to impede or attack her must first spend two Willpower points on each action in which he wishes to oppose her. This is an unnatural mental influence effect that is overcome when the attacking character has spent eight Willpower points.
   Glamour Resistance: This power is a work of glamour that will not deter Creation-born attackers whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Appearance.</description>

Characters are forbidden to impede or attack the raksha when she is in bedlam unless she first acts upon them during the scene in a hostile manner (by making a social attack, a physical attack, threatening one of their Intimacies, or something similar). This unnatural mental influence costs two Willpower to ignore for the rest of the scene.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's effortless grace at presenting delights of the Cup washes over his enemies like a tidal wave. The Raksha invokes this Charm after making a successful Cup- or Staff-shaping attack. The Charm allows the Raksha to count extra successes twice for purposes of determining damage.
   When activated in conjunction with any Assumption Charm (at a cost of one gossamer), Heart-Cutting Style allows the Raksha to enter Creation in a form of transcendent beauty, thereby gaining the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): At a cost of five motes, the Raksha can appear before a single being of Creation in that being's image of perfect beauty. With regard to that being, the Raksha ignores for the rest of the scene the cap on the MDV penalty she imposes in social combat for having a higher Appearance than the person with whom she is interacting (see "Relative Appearance" on p. 172 of Exalted).
   Glamour Resistance: Heart-Cutting Style is a work of glamour and will not affect any Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Appearance.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's grace deflects criticism and softens anger. In that way, she defends herself without appearing to do so. This Charm allows the Raksha to reflexively negate all penalties to her Cup Shaping DV against a single shaping attack. The Charm also adds the Raksha's Cup to the value of her Cup Shaping DV. This Charm does not function if the Raksha's Cup Shaping DV is already reduced to 0, however. This Charm has no utility in Creation.</description>

Natural influence which attempts to provoke such emotions or actions toward the raksha suffers a -1 external penalty. Characters with appropriate Shaping defenses or with cold iron touching their skin may attempt to inflict mental influence within this Charm's range as normal.
   Oneiromantic Benefit: Incorporated into an inward-facing dream, this Charm costs one point. Incorporated into an outward- facing glamour, this Charm costs three points and prevents conspiracies and hostility from being generated toward the oneiromantic spell itself. For example, a spell that takes the form of a singing stone would prevent nearby mortals from enticing their fellows to take up the suspicious faerie wonder and cast it into a nearby river so that it might trouble them no more.</errText>

        <description>The Raksha dazzles her enemies with circuitous arguments and logical fallacies, leaving them sputtering and impotent. Upon activating this Charm, the Raksha spends a variable number of motes (up to a maximum equal to twice her Valor). The Raksha then makes a Cup-shaping or Staff-shaping attack. If the attack hits, no damage is rolled. Instead, the Raksha stuns her adversary. The Raksha's player rolls one die for every mote spent on the Charm (plus dice for extra attack successes, as normal), applying the enemy's Temperance as soak to this roll. For the rest of the shaping battle, the target suffers an internal penalty on all shaping dice pools equal to the successes on the roll.
   Additionally, the Raksha can spend one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm to gain the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: variable): The Raksha must spend a variable number of motes (up to a maximum equal to twice her Valor). For the duration of one day, the Raksha inflicts an internal penalty equal to the number of motes spent on all rolls made against the Raksha by others in the context of social combat. This power represents a form of unnatural mental influence. An affected character can ignore the penalty for one scene by spending one Willpower point. The effect is completely overcome when the character has spent a number of Willpower points equal to the Raksha's Essence.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power of this Charm is a work of glamour that will not inflict any penalties on a Creation-born whose (Investigation + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's words cast a net of ideas and rhetoric around his enemy that digs into her flesh. This Charm aids the Raksha in Cup-shaping or Staff-shaping entanglement attacks. After spending three motes, the Raksha's player can add his character's Essence to all rolls to inflict, maintain, control or otherwise use an entanglement shaping attack. He also adds his Essence to all damage rolls based on the entanglement. Finally, a Raksha who knows this Charm automatically gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m): The Raksha can entangle a Creation-born in a web of confusion, distracting him from the danger the Raksha's honeyed words represent. The Raksha's player must roll (Manipulation + Performance) against the target's Dodge MDV. If the social attack is successful, the target will be unable to use his Dodge MDV to defend against the Raksha's attacks for the rest of the scene. All social attacks by the Raksha will become undodgeable with regard to that character.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power associated with this Charm is a work of glamour that cannot entangle a Creation-born whose (Investigation + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance.</description>

            <description>These Charms aid principally in Cup-shaping actions and attacks (and by extension, in most Staff-shaping actions and attacks). Some of these Charms also have mutation benefits that can be incorporated into the raksha's Assumption Charms to grant her powers in Creation, which are useful in more mundane settings. Although a gossamer cost is included, that cost needs to be paid only if the raksha wishes to incorporate the mutation effect into her Assumption form. Unless stated otherwise, ignore any gossamer costs for applications of these Charms when they are deployed in shaping combat.</description>

        <description>A storm rages across the Wyld. A flash of lightning, a peal of thunder, and the Raksha's enemies fall before him. This Charm permits the Raksha to flurry his shaping attacks against a multitude of opponents. The Raksha makes a single Cup- or Staff-shaping attack and applies the results against a number of targets equal to twice her Essence. If the Raksha who knows this Charm spends one additional gossamer when activating an Assumption Charm, she gains the following innate power for the rest of the story:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): As a practical matter, it is very difficult to engage multiple targets in social combat simultaneously unless all the parties involved are discussing the same subject. The Fair Folk laugh at this limitation. This power allows the Raksha to take multiple social combat actions on the same tick that have nothing to do with one another. The Raksha can simultaneously ask one person to submit to ravishing, another if he is willing to sell his daughter into slavery and a third if he would be willing to trade all of his worldly goods for a bowl of cold, foul-tasting soup. Each social attack is made at the Raksha's full dice pool. The social attacks represent natural mental influence (and therefore do not provoke Glamour Resistance), but given the high Social Attributes of many Raksha, they might as well be unnatural. A Raksha can make a maximum number of simultaneous social attacks equal to her Cup rating.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, a Raksha in the Wyld can fashion a shaping weapon for himself suitable for aiding in Cup- or Staff-shaping. The weapons that can be created through this Charm might include a figment, a heart thorn, a harness of razored dreams or a harness of twisting words, all of which are described more fully on pages 127-128 and 129-130. The Raksha fashions these instruments out of Essence and gossamer. In addition to the weapon's normal base qualities, the Raksha can divide a number of points equal to her Cup into improving its Accuracy, Damage, Defense or Rate, or into reducing its Speed (to an absolute minimum of 3). The creation is a work of permanent glamour that lasts for one shaping battle.
   This Charm has no utility in Creation.</description>

By laying his hand upon a mundane animal, the raksha may infuse it with the stuff of dreams, twisting its body into a form more to his liking. The animal gains (Cup x 3) points of mutations of the raksha's choosing, which persist for the remainder of the story. This Charm may not be used on any mundane animal owned by an Essenceuser without the owner's consent. With Essence 4+ the mutations bestowed by this Charm may be rendered permanent, at the raksha's discretion.
   Oneiromantic Benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into outward-facing glamours, targeting animals which undertake a certain sort of action (defined when the spell is created) within its range of effect.</errText>

        <description>With this Charm, the Raksha becomes a juggernaut of narrative power, who can force her way through the strongest defenses and compel a target to submit to her story. By spending three motes as part of a Cup- or Staff-shaping attack, the Raksha can make her attack unblockable. Also, if the attack is successful and the Raksha so desires, the force of her attack can knock the opponent out of the current milieu and into any adjacent waypoint.
   In addition, if a Raksha who knows this Charm also knows the Beguilement Charm (see pp. 206-207), she can spend one additional gossamer when using that Charm against a being of Creation. Doing so renders that being's Dodge MDV inapplicable and forces him to rely on his Parry MDV.</description>

   The raksha quickly spins together a narrative of travel, then collapses it into a blazing yellow-white corona wreathing a physical attack. Such glamours are of limited power outside of the Wyld, but still sufficient to impress and injure most Creation-born. If an attack supplemented by this Charm successfully strikes its target, the raksha's victim suffers knockback sufficient to drive her (Cup x Heart) yards backwards. Because the raksha's narrative is one of journey rather than ruin, the character takes no additional damage from impacts with scenery as the result of this Charm, though the place the target ends up may be in some way innately hazardous, such as a lava flow or thin air over the edge of a cliff. With Essence 4+ the raksha gains the option to pay a second point of gossamer when activating this Charm, increasing its knockback to (Cup x Heart x Essence) yards. With Essence 6+ the raksha may pay a third point of gossamer to knock opponents back up to one mile.</description>

Should the raksha ever touch the token, it immediately vanishes, the lost memory is restored, and the raksha may never use Rejection of Desire to forget it again.</errText>

        <description>Cut off from the Wyld energies that are their life's blood, Fair Folk in Creation must subsist on Essence leached from the Willpower and Virtues of mortal prey. In order to use this Charm, a Raksha must first touch a consenting Creation-born target, although this consent can be secured through natural or unnatural mental influence. Then, the Raksha's player must roll a number of dice equal to the Raksha's feeding Grace. Each success reduces either the target's permanent Willpower or the target's relevant Virtue (the Raksha's player's choice) by one point. For each point the victim loses, the Raksha regains 10 motes of temporary Essence.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. The Raksha who uses it cannot feed from creatures whose (targeted trait + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Willpower. Additionally, any attempt to drain the Virtues of an Exalt below the minimum imposed by the Great Curse will automatically fail.</description>

        <description>The dreaming mind of a mortal has much in common with the Wyld, especially when under the influence of one of the Fair Folk. This Charm allows a Raksha to influence the subconscious mind of a consenting mortal, invoking a potent dream, vision or hallucination to be shared by the Raksha and the mortal. As with Ravishing the Created Form, "consent" can be secured through invasive, mind-altering means. The shared dream is distracting to both parties, inflicting a -1 internal distraction penalty on both the Raksha and the mortal for the Charm's duration. This dreamscape permits the Raksha (and the mortal, if he is capable of shaping actions) to possess the benefits of accessing a Wyld zone even while in Creation's confines, as the chaotic infrastructure of the shared dreamscape is just as malleable as the Middle-marches to a skilled dream crafter.
       Mechanically, while the Raksha exists within the mortal's dreams, she treats the dreamscape as if it were a 10-waypoint space in the Middlemarches. She can create anything within this domain that she could fashion in the Middlemarches of the Wyld, and she can even abandon her current Assumption Charm and activate a new one. The Raksha can take anything created within the dreamscape back with her into Creation (assuming the item is something that could be transported from the Middlemarches into Creation). Any such items, however, whether they're possessions or gossamer, fade away when this Charm ends. If two Raksha find themselves within the same dreamscape, they can engage in shaping duels just as they could in the Wyld.
   Only the Raksha's consciousness actually enters the dreamscape - his body remains in Creation. The Raksha's player must roll (Perception + Awareness) for his character to remain aware of events occurring around his physical body, and that roll suffers a -3 internal penalty. If the Raksha suffers any physical damage, he automatically knows it and can terminate this Charm reflexively. While in the dreamscape, the Raksha exists in the narrative time associated with the Wyld, but no matter how long he subjectively stays in the dream, only one scene passes in Creation.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot affect a character whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance.</description>

        <description>The Raksha who possesses this Charm must also have some aspect of his physical form that can be revealed dramatically. When he does so, he can overwhelm the intellect of those who witness his performance, dazzling them with his brilliance. When the Raksha activates this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, it confers the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha must dramatically unveil some hidden aspect of himself as a reflexive action. For example, if the Raksha has wings, whether functional or not, he can spread them to reveal their iridescent plumage. If he wears a cloak, he can open it to show off the shifting, rainbow colors within. Regardless, when the Raksha reveals his hidden glory, it dazzles and hypnotizes those who observe. Any Creation-born who can see the hypnotic revelation suffers a -1 external penalty due to distraction. This power is a work of glamour, but it affects only the Raksha himself and thus offers no opportunity for Glamour Resistance.
   Furthermore, if a Creation-born botches a Virtue roll while interacting with the Raksha while this power is active, the Raksha can reflexively and permanently devour one dot of the botched Virtue, converting it into 10 motes of Essence. This aspect of the power is also a work of glamour but is susceptible to resistance.
   Glamour Resistance: The feeding aspect of this Charm cannot affect Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits the Raksha to ravish a Non-Consenting Creation-born with just a touch. The Raksha must successfully touch the victim, which might require a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll against an unwilling victim. The Raksha's player may then roll a number of dice equal to her character's feeding Grace. The roll inflicts no damage, but instead, reduces either the target's permanent Willpower or the target's relevant Virtue (the player's choice) by one point per success. For each point that is stripped away in this manner, the Raksha regains two motes of temporary Essence. Unlike the permanent effects of Ravishing the Created Form, Virtue or Willpower dots lost via this Charm return at a rate of one dot per day.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. The Raksha who uses it cannot feed from creatures whose (targeted trait + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Presence. Additionally, any attempt to drain the Virtues of an Exalt below the minimum imposed by the Great Curse will automatically fail.</description>

        <description>Within the context of the Wyld, there is truly no limit to the hunger of the Fair Folk... or to their capacity to satiate themselves. This Charm can be used only in the Wyld and on a consenting creature, though consent can be acquired through unnatural means. The Raksha's player rolls a number of dice equal to the Raksha's Cup rating against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. The attack inflicts no damage. Instead, with just one success, this Charm annihilates the target. The Raksha feasts upon the victim's soul, recovering 10 motes of Essence for each point of Willpower and Virtue the victim possessed. The Essence recovered cannot exceed the Raksha's normal Essence cap, nor can the Essence be shared with anyone else.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It automatically fails against creatures whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's feeding Grace. Also, the Charm automatically fails against Creation-born with Essence ratings of 2+ and against all Exalts.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits the Raksha to feed on ambient emotion within Creation. Raksha typically find such secondhand emotions to be feeble and bland, but beggars can't be choosers. Any Raksha who knows this Charm gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: None): After being in the presence of Creation-born experiencing powerful emotions, the Raksha can invoke this power to recover Essence from the emotional resonance that lingers over the scene. The Raksha's player then rolls a number of dice equal to the Raksha's feeding Grace, and the Raksha recovers one mote per success. The Raksha cannot recover more Essence than his normal Essence cap, and he can use this Charm only once per scene. This power affects only the Raksha himself and does not provoke Glamour Resistance. The power can benefit from appropriate Grace Excellency Charms.</description>

            <description>These Cup Charms are used by Raksha in Creation to feed upon mortals, through a process very similar to ravishment via Cup-shaping. Creatures of Creation heal from such Charms just as they do from conventional ravishment (see p. 125). Although these Charms are considered Cup Charms, many of them have a Cup requirement of 0, and creatures who have Graces but not a Cup Grace can learn these Charms.</description>

        <description>Just as a mosquito sucks the blood from sleeping victims, so too can the Raksha leach away the vitality of their very dreams. This Charm allows the Raksha to convert the oneiromantic power of a Creation-born's dreams into gossamer, granting him the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m; Speed: One dramatic action): The Raksha must be in the presence of a sleeping Creation-born to activate this power, which allows her to recover one gossamer. The Raksha can draw gossamer from a given mortal only once per scene. Although this Charm is technically a work of glamour, affected Creation-born are not protected by Glamour Resistance due to the fact that the targeted being is asleep and dreaming at the time.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Raksha can scrape together gossamer from the scraps of raw potential that pool around uncapped demesnes. The Raksha must visit an uncapped demesne, which can yield gossamer only once per story. Once the Raksha activates this Charm, the demesne provides gossamer equal to its rating. In addition, the Raksha automatically gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m; Speed: 5): The Raksha spends a mote of Essence, and her player rolls (Perception + Essence), adding the Raksha's Cup in automatic successes. On a success, the Raksha can sense any uncapped demesnes within (her successes x 10) miles.</description>

        <description>Though there is power to be gained by the consumption of human souls, the raksha primarily indulge in the practice for the blissful delight it brings them. Still, they respect the most refined epicureans among their kind, who have discovered new ways to distill strength from the Creation-born. Raksha who know this Charm may waive all other benefit when they consume a Creation-born's soul with Soul-Consuming Hunger in order to have that meal count as the passage of a tale for the purposes of training times.</description>

        <description>The Raksha fans the spark of the Wyld that burns in her soul, and it roars forth in a blaze that cannot be ignored. Anyone who sees the Raksha risks his soul being consumed by the entrancing flames of the Wyld itself. When the Raksha activates this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, she gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 8m): The Raksha must spend eight motes to activate this power for one day. The Raksha's presence becomes addictive to Creation-born. When the Raksha interacts one-on-one with a Creation-born character, her player can reflexively roll the character's (Charisma + Presence) against the target's Dodge MDV once per scene. If the roll is successful, the character becomes addicted to the Raksha's presence. The Raksha receives a +1 situational bonus on all normal social actions against addicted mortals.
   In addition, after each full month apart from the Raksha, the player of an addicted character must make a successful Willpower roll with a difficulty equal to the Raksha's Cup rating, lest his character be compelled to return to her. This addiction represents unnatural mental influence and can be overcome only after the Creation-born has spent three Willpower points.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It does not affect characters whose (Integrity + Essence) is greater than the Raksha's Presence.</description>

Anyone who sees the character risks his soul being consumed by the entrancing flames of the Wyld itself. The raksha's presence becomes addictive to Creation-born while this Charm is active. Roll (Charisma + Presence) upon activating this Charm and compare the results to the Dodge MDV of each Creation-born character the raksha interacts with for the rest of the day. If the roll overcomes a Creation-born's MDV, they become addicted to the raksha's presence. Addicted characters suffer a -1 external penalty to their MDV against the raksha's social attacks.
   Moreover, after each full week apart from the raksha, the player of an addicted character must make a successful Willpower roll with a difficulty equal to the raksha's Cup rating, lest his character be compelled to return to her. Breaking this unnatural addiction requires the expenditure of three points of Willpower.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into an outward-facing glamour, addicting mortals to the spell and whatever other effects it may inflict on them.</description>

        <description>The Raksha calls upon the Wyld to shape himself into the image of the icon that sits at the core of a mortal's dreams and nightmares. When a Raksha who knows this Charm activates it in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, he gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp): This Charm permits a Raksha to instantly addict a mortal to his presence (as per the rules outlined under Shiftless Untamed Beauty). The player of the Raksha must roll (Manipulation + Presence) as a reflexive action and get more successes than the target's Dodge MDV. In addition to the normal effects of addiction, affected characters cannot attack the Raksha during the scene without spending one Willpower point per hostile action. This addiction represents unnatural mental influence and can be overcome only after the Creation-born has spent Willpower equal to the Raksha's Essence. If the Raksha also has Shiftless Untamed Beauty active as part of his Assumption when he activates this power, the Willpower cost to overcome the addiction both temporarily and permanently is doubled.

Additionally, the Willpower cost necessary to break the Creation-born's addiction to the raksha rises to five points, which must all be spent at once.</description>

        <description>Those who become entranced by the beautiful horror of the Wyld cannot help but answer when it calls. This Charm allows a Raksha to summon to her (in either the Wyld or in Creation) any character who is either currently addicted to her presence or who has been in the past. The Raksha must spend one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm to gain the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha chooses which character she wishes to summon, and her player rolls (Manipulation + Performance) against the difficulty of the target's Essence. If the roll is successful, the Charm fills an addicted target's dreams with overwhelming images of the Raksha and her current location, coupled with a powerful need to see her again. In addition to the compulsion, the target also suffers a derangement of the Raksha's choice until he either returns to her side or breaks the addiction. Targets who have already broken the addiction experience the dreams but not the compulsion or derangement effects, and they suffer no ill effects from the dreams themselves.
   This effect represents unnatural mental influence and can be overcome only after the Creation-born has spent Willpower equal to the Raksha's Essence. If the Raksha also has Shiftless Untamed Beauty active as part of his Assumption when he activates this power, the Willpower cost to resist the summons both temporarily and permanently is doubled. While the summons is active, the affected character cannot overcome the underlying addiction until after he has first overcome the summons, although a character can spend Willpower on both simultaneously if he can afford to do so.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect a character whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance.</description>

   The raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Performance) against her desired target's Dodge MDV. If the roll is successful, when the target next sleeps their dreams will be filled with overwhelming images of the raksha and her current location, coupled with an overwhelming Compulsion to see her again. Spending five Willpower immunizes an addict to this summons for one month; spending one Willpower immunizes a former addict for one season. Summoned addicts may not break their addiction until they have overcome or completed their summons.
   At Essence 4+, the raksha may also inflict a derangement of her choice on an addict who has fallen prey to her summons (generally an overwhelming obsession with her), which lasts until they break the Compulsion or are reunited with her. With Essence 5+ she may inflict derangements on former addicts, as well.</description>

        <description>Once the Raksha enters the soul of an addicted mortal, he always has a channel into her heart. This Charm permits a Raksha to communicate with a mortal addicted to him through the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m): The Raksha can open a channel into the mind of any character addicted to his presence. The Raksha's player must roll his character's (Charisma + Performance) against the target's Dodge MDV in Creation or simply make a Cup-shaping action if he is in the Wyld. If successful, he can speak what messages he desires or implant whatever delightful or grotesque images he fancies directly into the addict's mind. This power can be enhanced by appropriate Charms that modify Cup-shaping actions.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect characters whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Presence.</description>

            <description>Once an addicted soul has fallen under the sway of the Fair Folk, their heart is always an open book. This Charm permits the raksha to communicate with any Creation-born addicted to him; the faerie may make social attacks against addicted targets regardless of range, even in other realms of existence. Each such social attack costs three motes. If both the raksha and her target are in the Wyld, the raksha may instead make Cup-shaping attacks against addicted individuals (which may be enhanced by appropriate Charms, as normal), again for a cost of three motes.</description>

            <description>Through these Charms, a Raksha invokes the echoes of the techniques used aeons ago by the Primordials to fashion Creation out of the roiling chaos of the Wyld. These Charms permit a Raksha to insert herself into the fabric of Creation, interweaving the story of her life seamlessly into the greater narrative of patterned existence. They can also affect the relationship between mortals and, in some cases, the fates of mortals. These Charms are often used in conjunction with oneiromancy.

        <description>The people of Creation fear the Fair Folk - and for good reason - but sometimes, it is not helpful to be feared. When activated in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, this Charm causes the form the Raksha wears in Creation to appear less threatening to mortals. If the Raksha's basic form is at least humanoid, this Charm allows her to pass as a normal human. If her form is clearly non-human, this Charm causes Creation-born to recognize her as a natural and beneficial god of Creation. In either case, absent successful Glamour Resistance or the application of powerful Charms such as All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight, it is impossible for an observer to ever notice that the Raksha is one of the Fair Folk.
   An unshaped Raksha who knows this Charm can cause a veil of seeming normalcy to fall over the waypoint that defines it, causing all who enter to believe that the waypoint is familiar location, possibly even a part of Creation. When used in this manner, the Charm allows the unshaped Raksha to automatically gain surprise on its first Cup-shaping attack against affected visitors.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour and has no effect on beings whose (Perception + Essence) is greater than the Raksha's Performance.</description>

        <description>Having learned how to pass as a being of Creation, the Raksha can now weave himself into the fabric of human social interaction. This Charm allows a Raksha who has entered Creation to spread gossamer out into the surrounding community, forming new relationships between the Raksha and the mortals of the area, relationships that affected mortals absolutely believe to be preexisting and completely real. The Raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Performance). For each success, the Raksha gains one temporary dot of Allies or Followers (he can split successes among the two Backgrounds as he wishes). The Raksha does not actually get to choose his allies or followers, but they are always appropriate to his needs of the moment. The allies and followers maintain their fully developed relationship with the Raksha for the duration of the current season. As a side effect, third parties who do not become allies or followers but who would otherwise be expected to know of such a relationship between an ally or follower and the Raksha will also be persuaded of the relation-ship's long-term existence and validity (except, of course, for third parties who are capable of Glamour Resistance). This Charm lasts for a maximum of one season but will end prematurely if the Raksha terminates his Assumption before then.
   An unshaped Raksha can use this Charm to gain insight into the relationships of visitors that it can use against them in the context of Cup-shaping actions. The unshaped Raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Performance) against the Shaping DV ratings of any visitors it wishes. For each extra success, the Raksha gains a +1 bonus on its next Cup-shaping attack, as the glamour invoked manifests as illusions of friends, allies or lovers of the visitors to lull them into a false sense of security.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour and cannot persuade a Creation-born of the relationship's existence if her (Perception + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance. When the Charm ends, any affected mortal will completely forget about her temporary alliance with the Raksha unless her (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance.</description>

        <description>The gossamer unleashed by the Fair Folk on unsuspecting mortals transforms into a hailstorm of misery and bad luck. In this manner, the Raksha rewrites the part a mortal plays, reducing him in stature from a leading role to a mere bit player. After the Raksha interacts with a Creation-born, her player rolls (Manipulation + Larceny) in an opposed roll against the target's (Charisma + Integrity). For each extra success accumulated by the Raksha, the target loses one dot in Allies, Followers or Mentor, as chosen by the Raksha. A sudden argument causes an ally to storm away from the character. A follower becomes distracted by some urgent business and can no longer attend to the character's needs. The mentor is distracted, preoccupied, kidnapped or otherwise unable to come to the character's aid. This Charm will never actually result in the death of affected allies, followers or mentors, it merely severs their connection to the target character. This Charm lasts for a maximum of one season but will end prematurely if the Raksha terminates her Assumption before then.
   For unshaped Raksha, this Charm works as it does for shaped Raksha, save that it can be used to sever a relationship only if the affected character and his allies, followers or mentor (as appropriate) are all within the Raksha's waypoint.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot drive away allies, followers or mentors whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Stealth. Additionally, if the target has a (Wits + Essence) exceeding the Raksha's Stealth, the target can use a stunt or Charm to hunt down lost associates and convince them that their anger or preoccupation is an illusion. Any affected allies, followers or mentors whose (Intelligence + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Stealth will realize that their actions were unnaturally influenced. Otherwise, an affected character will simply rationalize his conduct.</description>

        <description>Although utterly alien to Creation, the Fair Folk have ironically powerful insights into its nature and character. This Charm allows a Raksha who has entered Creation to intuitively gain insight into her new surroundings simply by reading patterns of Essence invisible to even the most perceptive Creation-born. Normally, all Fair Folk suffer a -3 penalty on all Lore and Occult rolls pertaining to Creation. By incorporating this Charm into her Assumption, the Raksha totally negates that penalty.
   Although it is technically a work of glamour, this Charm affects only the Raksha herself and does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

The Raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Investigation). For each success, the Raksha gains one temporary dot in Contacts. This Charm cannot be used to raise the Raksha's Contacts rating above his Essence. The benefits of this Charm last for a maximum of one season but will end prematurely if the Raksha terminates his Assumption before then.
   Although this Charm is technically a work of glamour, it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.

In other words, the Charm will never attempt to make someone into a contact for the Raksha if that person would be capable of resisting the Charm in the first place.</description>

   Innate Power (Cost: 1m): The Raksha interacts with a situation or a thing that she wishes to conceal from investigation or discovery by others. Then, her player rolls (Manipulation + Stealth). Successfully using this Charm inflicts a -1 external penalty on all attempts to find out anything about whatever thing or matter was occluded through the use of the Contacts Background or any similar Background. Even better, it inflicts an external penalty equal to the Raksha's successes on all Investigation, Lore, Occult or Socialize rolls to investigate such matters. The effects of this power last for a maximum of one season but will end prematurely if the Raksha terminates her Assumption before then.

            <description>Fair Folk who wish to walk among the Creation-born like the predators they are had best learn to conceal their tracks. The raksha interacts with an event, individual, or object she wishes to protect from discovery, then spends two motes and rolls (Manipulation + Stealth).

Valid individuals include any person the raksha has at least had a brief conversation or physical altercation with, including herself. Valid objects include any object the raksha owns or has handled extensively for at least one scene, so long as it does not belong to another raksha or a Creation-born with a higher Essence than her own. Valid events include any particular occurrence lasting no longer than one scene which the raksha participated in or was present to witness, such as a murder, a secret meeting, or a lovers' tryst.
   Oneiromantic benefit: Incorporated into an inward-facing dream for three points, the spell automatically attempts to conceal a certain type of occurrence each time the spell's possessor is involved in it. Incorporated into an outward-facing glamour for nine points, the spell automatically suppresses memories of a certain pre-defined occurrence each time someone within the range of its effect encounters the noted circumstance.</description>

            <description>Through these Charms, a Raksha invokes the echoes of the techniques used aeons ago by the Primordials to fashion Creation out of the roiling chaos of the Wyld. These Charms permit a Raksha to insert herself into the fabric of Creation, interweaving the story of her life seamlessly into the greater narrative of patterned existence. They can also affect the relationship between mortals and, in some cases, the fates of mortals. These Charms are often used in conjunction with oneiromancy.
   Some of these Charms can also be used by the unshaped Raksha to redefine the relationships and characteristics of those who wander into the waypoint that defines an unshaped Raksha's existence. In this manner, the unshaped Raksha deceives its visitors into believing that they are in Creation, thus preventing them from seeing the terrible danger that surrounds them.
   Although they are Glamour Charms, these Charms generally do not create innate powers in the same manner as most such Charms. Instead, they represent subtle manipulations of gossamer used to infect parts of Creation.</description>

        <description>Subtle yet potent, the Raksha's cunning disguise allows him to penetrate ever deeper into the narrative structure of Creation, transforming himself into a person of importance to be respected by the Creation-born. This Charm allows a Raksha who has entered Creation to insinuate himself into the social structures of the Creation-born as represented by the Backing, Influence and Resources Backgrounds. The Raksha's player spends two gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption and rolls the Raksha's (Manipulation + Performance). For each success, the Raksha gains one dot that can be allocated between Backing, Influence or Resources for the duration of the Assumption. None of these Backgrounds can be increased above the Raksha's Essence, though the Raksha can divide up his successes among different Influences or Backing organizations. The Raksha can choose general regional influence or influence within a specific organization.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. Influence or Backing gained from it cannot be used to give the Raksha influence over Creation-born whose (Perception + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance. Unaffected characters realize instantly that the Raksha is not entitled to the authority he claims. A cunning Raksha can circumvent unaffected characters, however, by filtering his orders through intermediaries who are affected and who have sufficient Influence or Backing in their own right to simply order the unaffected character to do as the Raksha wishes. A Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Performance penetrates the Raksha's pretend-Resources, seeing it for the fool's gold it is.</description>

        <description>As Imposition of Law permits the Raksha to incorporate into herself a truth that cannot be denied, this Charm allows her to grant a similar benefit to one of the Creation-born. This Charm functions exactly like Imposition of Law (see p. 168), except that instead of guaranteeing an automatic success for herself on a specific (Attribute + Ability [Specialty]) roll, the Raksha defines such a roll upon which the target of this Charm will always succeed. The Charm adds three gossamer to the cost of an Assumption and confers the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp): For one season, the Raksha guarantees a Creation-born at least one success on the (Attribute + Ability [Specialty]) roll the Raksha has chosen to improve. If internal penalties reduce the Creation-born's dice pool to 0, he still gets one success. If external penalties (including DV) reduce his successes to 0, he still gets one success. In combat (assuming the dice pool to which this power is applied is an attack roll), the Raksha will always hit his target, although this power does nothing to aid him in penetrating soak.
   As with Imposition of Law, there are two limitations on this power. First, the Creation-born does not gain an automatic success if his action is opposed either by Charms or by a stunt. Second, the Creation-born cannot do something that is simply impossible. For example, the Raksha might choose (Charisma + Socialize [Seduction]) so that a Creation-born farm boy might win a princess's love. Generally, the young man is assured of seducing his target regardless of social penalties, MDVs and so forth. If the farm boy is never allowed to even meet the princess, however, this power would not guarantee his success. Similarly, he does not gain the single automatic success if the princess stunts (convincing the simple farm boy that she's merely the princess's servant) or uses an Integrity Charm to resist the youth's pitched woo.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. The Raksha cannot confer the benefits of this Charm on any character whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Intelligence, no matter how much the character might wish to be the recipient of this blessing.</description>

        <description>The antithesis of the Charm that precedes it, Curse of Definition allows the Raksha to assault the integral nature of his enemy by inflicting upon her a curse in the form of a mundane task at which she will always fail. The Raksha chooses a specific Attribute, Ability and specialty each time he purchases this Charm. By spending four gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp): For the next season, the affected character will automatically fail at the action defined by the (Attribute + Ability [Specialty]) chosen unless the character incorporates a stunt or a Charm into the action. Even then, the character's player suffers a -2 external penalty on the roll. As long as it can be defined by a single, specific Attribute, Ability and specialty combination, the action at which the character is doomed to fail can be quite broad - "waking up" and "drinking water" are both suitable actions for purposes of this Charm. The effects of this power end prematurely if the Raksha terminates his Assumption.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect any character whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Stealth.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's understanding of herself permits her to bolster her own spiritual integrity, hardening her Virtues as need be to weather the storms of her existence. If the Raksha is in the Wyld, her player spends five motes and makes a Cup-shaping action. For each success, the Raksha can increase the rating of one of her Virtues or Graces. The Raksha cannot add more than her Essence to either a Virtue or Grace through any combination of Charms, and she cannot divide successes up among multiple traits with a single application of this Charm. This benefit lasts until the Raksha's next shaping action, but she can reflexively extend this benefit over the course of additional shaping actions at a cost of five motes per extra action. Additionally, by spending one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Medicine), increasing the rating of one of her Virtues or Graces by one point per success. This effect will last for one scene but can be extended at a cost of five motes spent at the beginning of each new scene. This power affects only the Raksha and does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's mastery of self extends to dominion over others. This Charm allows the Raksha to artificially heighten the power of another character's Virtues. The Raksha chooses the Virtue to enhance and makes an entanglement Cup-shaping attack against another character. If the attack is successful, the target is not ravished. Instead, each extra success on the roll adds one dot to the targeted Virtue for all purposes except for ravishment purposes. The extra dots count toward Virtues rolls, Willpower and Essence pool cal-culation, and acquiring Limit, as appropriate, but if any Fair Folk attempts to ravish the target, only her normal Virtues apply. The Raksha cannot increase a target's Virtue by more than the target's Essence through any combination of effects. This effect lasts for one tale in the Wyld.
   Additionally, by spending one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m): First, the Raksha must interact with a Creation-born for a scene. Then, the Raksha chooses which Virtue to augment before his player makes a (Manipulation + Medicine) roll against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Each success adds one dot to the targeted Virtue. The effects of this power last for one scene, but the power otherwise functions like the shaping combat aspect of the Charm.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Medicine.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's insights into the nature of Virtue now permit her to strike a mighty blow at the very root of her enemy's nature. This Charm allows the Raksha to damage one of another creature's Virtues. The Raksha's player chooses which Virtue to affect, and her character makes a standard Cup-shaping attack against the target. If the attack is successful, the affected character immediately loses one channel from the targeted Virtue and suffers a -1 external penalty on all rolls made for that Virtue. Both of these effects last for the duration of the tale.
   Additionally, by spending three gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m): The Raksha's player must roll (Manipulation + Medicine) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. If the roll is successful, the targeted character loses one channel from the targeted Virtue and suffers a -1 external penalty on all rolls made for that Virtue. The character recovers the lost Virtue channel as normal. The external penalty lasts for one scene. These effects are not stackable.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that does not affect characters whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Medicine.</description>

            <description>The raksha's insights into the nature of Virtue now permit her to strike a mighty blow at the very root of her enemy's nature. This Charm may supplement a physical attack, social attack, or Cup-shaping attack. If successful, in addition to any of its other effects, the attack strips away of the target's all channels of a single Virtue of the raksha's choice, and imposes a -1 external penalty to all rolls made using that Virtue for one scene, or one tale if delivered via a Cup-shaping attack.
   Oneiromantic benefit: Incorporated into an outward-facing glamour, this Charm attempts to launch a Cup-shaping attack (even in Creation) once per scene against each character within its range of effect who takes a certain pre-defined action.</description>

        <description>Occasionally - quite rarely, in fact - a Raksha experiences something approaching pity. Or perhaps, the Raksha just sees something she wants and is willing to make a trade. This Charm allows a Raksha to heal the effects of ravishment inflicted on others. It can restore damaged Virtues and Willpower to their previous levels, and it can remove the effects of ravishment (see pp. 124-125).
   In order to activate this Charm, the Raksha must be willing to sacrifice an oneiromancy spell she possesses. Used to cure a character's ravishment, the sacrificed spell must have an Artifact rating equal to or above the target's original Cup rating (or targeted trait rating if the Charm is used to heal a Creation-born of ravishment).
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour and cannot affect a Creation-born whose (wounded trait + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Medicine, no matter how much the Creation-born might want it to.</description>

            <description>Staff-shaping combat is innovative in its possibilities. A Raksha who defeats her enemy in a Staff-shaping contest has the option of inflicting Cup-, Ring- or Sword-shaping damage in the future. Accordingly, many Charms from the Shaping Combat cascades of those Graces can also benefit Staff attacks and actions, and Diplomats who engage in shaping combat typically study the shaping combat approach associated with one of those Graces. There are only two exclusive Staff-Shaping Combat Charms.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.

            <description>The Prince of Chaos is a terrifying figure to the Fair Folk, for it is his way to transform desire into obsession, to turn a Raksha's capacity for positive emotion into a soul-deadening fountain of despair. Associated with Cup-shaping combat, the Spirit-Twisting Obsession Style teaches Entertainers to kill with kindness and to burn with a kiss. A Raksha who plays the part of the Prince of Chaos must never channel his Compassion during a shaping combat, or else he will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the Prince of Chaos must adopt the mien of a cruel and sadistic villain. He must never openly display kindness or concern for the weak or innocent or ignore an opportunity to demonstrate his contempt for his lessers. If he ever does so, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of his current tale.</description>

            <description>The Prince of Chaos is a terrifying figure to the Fair Folk, for it is his way to transform desire into obsession, to turn a Raksha's capacity for positive emotion into a soul-deadening fountain of despair. Associated with Cup-shaping combat, the Spirit-Twisting Obsession Style teaches Entertainers to kill with kindness and to burn with a kiss. A Raksha who plays the part of the Prince of Chaos must never channel his Compassion during a shaping combat, or else he will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the Prince of Chaos must adopt the mien of a cruel and sadistic villain. He must never openly display kindness or concern for the weak or innocent or ignore an opportunity to demonstrate his contempt for his lessers. If he ever does so, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of his current tale.</description>

        <description>The second teaching of the Prince of Chaos is to understand that Virtue is an illusion, calculated to conceal from its possessor his own flaws and frailties. This Charm allows the Raksha to metaphorically praise one of the Virtues of her opponent and, by doing so, bring him low. The Raksha activates this Charm after her target declares either a shaping or normal action but before his player rolls. The Raksha's player rolls (Manipulation + Performance) in Creation or any Cup-shaping attack in the Wyld. The difficulty is equal to the target's Essence. If the roll succeeds, the Charm forces the target to spend a point of Willpower (if he has any left) and channel the praised Virtue on that action, even if doing so is wildly inappropriate to the declared action. This Charm will not function if the target has exhausted his temporary Willpower or has no available channels left for that Virtue during the current story.
   Glamour Resistance: In Creation, this Charm represents a work of glamour that cannot affect any Creation-born whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.

        <description>The Raksha assumes the mantle of the Prince of Chaos, a living symbol of the corruption of one's own sense of self. The Raksha then shares the wisdom of his insights with his enemies. Upon activating this Charm, the Raksha names a single opponent, who must be at least potentially a participant in the current shaping battle. For the Charm's duration, that opponent suffers an internal penalty equal to the Raksha's permanent Essence from all shaping dice pools and suffers a penalty equal to half that to all Shaping DV scores. This Charm affects only Raksha in the Wyld. It has no utility in Creation or against Creation-born in the Wyld.
   This is a Stance-type Charm. A character cannot have more than one Stance-type Charm active at a time, and activating a new Stance-type Charm terminates any previous one.</description>

        <description>As the target struggles ever harder against the chains that the Prince of Chaos wraps around his soul, they only grow tighter. The Raksha activates this Charm in conjunction with a Cup-shaping attack. If the attack is successful, its damage becomes piercing. If the attack was already piercing, it completely bypasses the target's soak.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.
   The styles that follow are those most commonly known and understood.</description>

        <description>Generally, when a Raksha wishes to affect a thing or being within the confines of Creation, she must do so through a work of glamour. A being of Creation can see through such works of glamour if the being's (opposed trait + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's (shaping trait). The precise traits involved in resisting a work of glamour are detailed under each Charm's description. This Charm permits the Raksha to bolster the integrity of her fictions. For every point of gossamer spent on this Charm, the Raksha increases her shaping trait by one for purposes of determining whether beings of Creation can resist the glamour.
   This Charm may be purchased multiple times. Each time it applies to a different trait, which is typically an Attribute or Ability. If the Raksha uses a version of this Charm to boost a particular shaping trait, then the increase applies to all works of glamour for which that trait determines Glamour Resistance for the duration of the story. A Raksha cannot boost a shaping trait by more than her Heart Grace.</description>

        <description>The Raksha builds into his very being an undeniable truth in the form of a mundane task for which failure, for him, is nearly impossible. Each time this Charm is purchased, the player chooses an Attribute, an Ability and a specialty that define a specific mundane action. A Raksha can acquire this Charm a number of times equal to his Heart Grace. If he spends two gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, he incorporates perfection at that task into his nature, gaining the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp): For one day after paying the cost for this power, the Raksha guarantees himself at least one success on the (Attribute + Ability [Specialty]) roll he has chosen to improve. If internal penalties reduce his dice pool to 0, he still gets one success. If external penalties (including DV) reduce his successes to 0, he still gets one success. In combat (assuming the dice pool to which this Charm is applied is an attack roll), the Raksha will always hit his target, although this Charm does nothing to aid him in penetrating soak.
   Two limitations on this power exist, however. First, the Raksha does not gain an automatic success if his action is opposed by either Charms or a stunt. Second, the Raksha cannot do something that is simply impossible. For example, a Fair Folk Cataphract might choose (Dexterity + Archery [Longbow]) to become the world's greatest archer. Generally, he is assured of hitting a target regardless of environmental penalties, DV, extreme range and no matter how small the target is. If the range is so great that it is simply beyond the possible range of a bow, however, this power cannot guarantee his success. Similarly, even though he is certain to hit a fleeing mortal enemy with his bow, he does not gain the single automatic success if the enemy stunts (leaping out into a chasm to escape the Fair Folk pursuers) or uses a Dodge Charm to evade the arrow.
   If the Raksha has more than one version of this Charm, he can spend two gossamer for each version he incorporates into his Assumption. The Raksha can then activate all of the Imposition of Law effects built into his Assumption at once by spending 10 motes and one Willpower. The benefits conferred by this power last for one day but end early if the Raksha terminates his Assumption.</description>

        <description>While Imposition of Law defines an action at which the Raksha is certain to succeed, this Charm defines a type of danger from which the Raksha need have no fear. This Charm is actually a cluster of five Charms, one associated with each of the Graces. Each Charm renders the Raksha utterly immune to a fairly broad source of non-magical harm or to a particular form of shaping damage. In Creation, if the Raksha is threatened by a magically augmented attack (as defined under each of the descriptions that follow), Bastion of the Self instead improves his defense against the attack. In the Wyld, it confers total immunity to the listed shaping damage type. A Raksha can purchase this Charm only once, and no version of this Charm will protect a Raksha from attacks or damage that incorporate cold iron.
   In the Wyld, the Raksha can activate this Charm reflexively by spending 10 motes and one Willpower, and the Charm's effects last for one tale. When activating it in conjunction with an Assumption, the Charm costs four gossamer and lasts for the Assumption's duration. A Raksha who has not acquired the Charm as a mutation can activate it reflexively in Creation by spending 10 motes, one Willpower and four gossamer. In the latter case, the Charm lasts for one day.
   Bastion of the Self (Cup): The Raksha is protected from non-magical effects that weaken the Raksha in some way or reduce any of his traits (poisons, disease, dehydration, etc.), as well as Cup-shaping attacks. If the effect is the result of a Charm, spell or innate power, including natural poisons created through magical means (such as Raksha powers or Lunar shapeshifting), the Raksha instead adds his Essence in dice to any relevant roll to resist the effect.
   Bastion of the Self (Ring): The Raksha is protected from natural mental influence and from Ring-shaping attacks. If the effect is one that causes unnatural mental influence, the Raksha instead adds his Essence to his applicable MDV. Charms and other effects that merely increase the attacker's normal dice pool but otherwise result in natural mental influence do not count as magical attacks for purposes of this power.
   Bastion of the Self (Staff): The Raksha is protected from non-magical social combat attacks and from Staff-shaping attacks. If the social attack is aided by a Charm or other supernatural effect, the Raksha instead adds his Essence to his applicable MDV. Charms and other effects that merely increase the attacker's normal dice pool but otherwise result in natural mental influence do not count as magical attacks for purposes of this power.
   Bastion of the Self (Sword): The Raksha is immune to all non-magical attacks and to Sword-shaping attacks. In this context, "attacks" include any deliberate attempt to inflict harm on the Raksha with mundane weaponry or non-magical martial arts. If an attack made against the Raksha employs either a magical weapon or uses a Charm or other supernatural power, the Raksha instead adds his Essence to his applicable DV.
   Bastion of the Self (Heart): The Raksha is immune to all non-magical forms of damage from any source. Against normal attacks, it duplicates the benefits of Bastion of the Self (Sword). Against environmental damage effects, it confers total immunity to damage unless the environmental damage is caused by a magical effect, including the Charms and innate powers of Raksha and elementals or the anima powers of Dragon-Blooded. Where environmental damage effects are the result of magic, the Raksha either adds his Essence to any applicable DV or adds his Essence in dice to any relevant dice roll to resist damage. Bastion of the Self (Heart) provides no protection whatsoever from shaping attacks.</description>

This Charm may be activated in conjunction with an Assumption or reflexively while in the Wyld. In the former case, it lasts while the Assumption does. In the latter case, it lasts for the duration of the tale. In either case, when the Raksha enters bedlam, she can spend five motes to instantly recover temporary Willpower and gain new gossamer equal to the Virtue with which the bedlam is associated. This action is reflexive.</description>

Whenever exposed to a statement made or written by an individual whose soul the raksha has fed on, the raksha automatically knows the motivation behind the statement as though she had successfully examined it using the Solar Charm Sagacious Reading of Intent (see Exalted, p. 233); unlike Sagacious Reading of Intent, Recognition of Hidden Possibilities provides no protection from scrutinized statements, only deeper understanding of their intent. Valid targets of this Charm are any character the raksha has successfully used a Feeding Charm on that causes permanent trait loss, such as Ravishing the Created Form or Soul-Consuming Hunger, but not Heart-Stealing Kiss or Banquet of Crumbs.</errText>

She cocks her ear, as if to listen for the source of the faint buzzing, and then shakes her head as if to clear a momentary fancy from it. This Charm allows the Raksha to improve her soak against a single shaping attack.

Writhing Ego Invasion has no effect on attacks made with cold iron, and cannot be activated if the raksha has no valid Intimacies to lose, even if she has Willpower to spare.</errText>

This Charm may only be activated while the raksha is wearing shaping armor, and enhances the soak provided by that armor by two points per mote invested, to a maximum investment of the character's Heart.
   Waking: Moving with the speed of a broken dream, the Raksha shields himself from the nightmares of others. Normally, donning shaping armor requires a number of sequential Speed 6, DV -3 shaping actions equal to the armor's mobility penalty. For every two motes spent in the activation of this Charm, the Raksha reduces the number of shaping actions required to don armor by one, to a minimum of one Speed 6, DV -3 shaping action.
   In their native environment the raksha routinely lounge about in lakes of bright fire, tame world-sized sandstorms to impress friends and lovers, and crush themselves beneath mountains to prove obscure philosophical points. It always faintly surprises them that Creation is so unforgiving of such minor indulgences, but no matter - they have learned to adapt. This Charm permits the raksha to reach out and snatch at an environmental hazard, deftly weaving it into a protective shawl of glamour that he may drape about his body. Doing so provides immunity to that one particular environmental hazard for the Charm's duration. This Charm terminates itself if the raksha comes into physical contact with cold iron while it is active.
   Oneiromantic benefit: Incorporated into an oneiromantic spell, this Charm provides immunity to one pre-selected form of environmental hazard. Inward-facing dreams protect their possessor, while outward-facing glamours protect everyone within an area.
       Mutation benefit: One adjuration or behemoth gains immunity to a specific form of environmental hazard.</description>

            <errText>Waking: The Fair Folk are nothing without their dreams. This Charm helps a character hold fast to her dreams in the face of temptation, fortifying one of her Intimacies of the player's choice. This Intimacy must be to a dream or an ambition - something the raksha hopes to make of herself, or of the world, or of her fellows. All mental influence which would cause the raksha to abandon or betray this dream is treated as an unacceptable order. If the raksha voluntarily abandons the Intimacy or it becomes obsolete, she may select a new Intimacy to render inviolate at the beginning of the next story. Her player may also shift the focus of this Charm to a new Intimacy at any time by spending one experience point.</errText>

        <description>Only technically considered a Charm at all, this power is really more of a plot device. Crossing through the shinma Nirakara at the Gateway of Sundraprisha has no cost. When the unshaped raksha's ruling Emanation activates this Charm,the Chaos Lord's Heart Grace is reduced to 4. All of its other Graces shatter, and each of its Emanations other than its ruling Emanation dies instantly. All of the waypoints under the unshaped's control collapse and are sucked intothe ruling Emanation, and a new shaped raksha coalesces around it. The unshaped raksha’s power condenses into new Graces and forms a coherent matrix of Wyld energy. Although the unshaped has wide latitude in choosing the ultimate structure of its shaped form, it is limited by a specific template that, as a practical matter, follows the guidelines for character creation outlined in Chapter Three.
   In other words, activating this Charm allows the unshaped to "create a noble raksha character" under the normal character-creation rules for making noble characters, subject to the following modifications. First, the newly shaped raksha, as stated previously, has a Heart Grace of 4. Second, he automatically gains four free dots in the Birth Background. Finally, for every dot by which the unshaped raksha’s original Heart Grace was reduced to reach the four-dot level, the shaped raksha gains 10 additional bonus points. The unshaped raksha has the option of reducing its Heart Grace to 3, gaining 10 more bonus points, but unshaped raksha never reduce themselves to below that. The advantages of 10 extra bonus points are simply not worth becoming a commoner, even a heroic one.
   Once the Charm is activated, the unshaped becomes a shaped noble raksha for all purposes. He can use Assumption Charms and even acquire permanent mutations. He can enter Creation with appropriate protection. He can use Charms that have the Shaped-Only keyword on himself. As long as the raksha does not gain any permanent mutations, he retains the option of ending this Charm and becoming unshaped once more. To do so, the raksha must enter an unoccupied waypoint in the Deep Wyld, obtain ownership over it, and succeed in a Cup-shaping roll against a difficulty equal to his own permanent Essence. If the roll is successful, the raksha becomes unshaped once more. A raksha with a permanent mutation of any sort is incapable of passing back through the Gateway of Sundraprisha.
   Even after becoming unshaped again, the raksha does not necessarily become the same unshaped he was before. Instead, the unshaped raksha possesses a new Heart Grace (rated at 5) whose Emanation is based on the personality and appearance it had while shaped, rather than that of the prior Heart Grace. The unshaped also acquires four new Graces, each of which is initially rated at 2, and the unshaped can distribute a number of dots equal to (the permanent Essence of the prior shaped raksha + 5) among those Graces. As the unshaped does so, four new Emanations come into existence, each of whom has the traits of a noble raksha with a Heart Grace of 3, plus 10 experience points per dot of permanent Essence the raksha had while shaped. The unshaped's Heart Emanation retains all of the shaped raksha’s former memories but has little emotional connection to them. The other Emanations have no memories of shaped life.
   Any shaped raksha character without permanent mutations can pass back through the Gateway of Sundraprisha and become unshaped. By doing so, however, the raksha ceases to be a playable character. Furthermore, even if a player's raksha character becomes unshaped and then becomes shaped again, the re-shaped character is a completely new character unrelated in anyway to the prior shaped life except through shared history. Basically, for a shaped raksha, crossing back through Nirakara is suicide in every way that matters.</description>

            <description>A raksha who uses this Charm fundamentally shifts the order of her being by passing through the shinma Nirakara at the Gateway of Sundraprisha. When an unshaped raksha's ruling Emanation activates this Charm, the lord of chaos's Heart compresses to 3. All of its other Graces shatter and each of its other Emanations ceases to exist. All of the waypoints under the unshaped's control collapse and are sucked into the ruling Emanation, and a new shaped raksha coalesces around it. The unshaped raksha's power condenses into new Graces and forms a coherent matrix of Wyld energy. Although the unshaped has wide latitude in choosing the ultimate structure of its shaped form, it is limited by a specific template that, as a practical matter, follows the guidelines for character creation outlined in Chapter Three of Graceful Wicked Masques.
   In essence, activating the Gateway of Sundraprisha permits an unshaped to cease to exist as itself and to create a new noble raksha character under the normal character creation rules for generating such characters.
   Once this Charm has been activated, the unshaped becomes a shaped noble raksha for all purposes. The newly shaped noble has imperfect recollection of its previous existence as one of the unshaped, and its memories are an untidy gestalt of bits and pieces of its former Emanations, with the dominant Emanation foremost among them. The raksha is aware of itself as a continuation of the previous unshaped, but its personality will be a fusion of the unshaped's various aspects and will not precisely map to any previous Emanation. The same is true of its traits. For most functional purposes, the shaped noble is essentially a new character which considers itself to share continuity-of-identity with the unshaped it used to be.
   Shaped raksha may also learn this Charm, and may pass through the Gateway of Sundraprisha in any waypoint in the Deep Wyld that they own and which is occupied by no other characters. If the raksha was formerly unshaped, this does not guarantee he will become the same unshaped he was previously; his shaped form dissolves, and his Heart Grace swells to a rating of 5, whose Emanation will be loosely based on the person the raksha was as a shaped being. Her other Graces shatter and are replaced by four new Graces, each of which is initially rated at 2, and the unshaped can distribute a number of dots equal to (her permanent Essence prior to passing through the Gateway of Sundraprisha + 5) among those Graces. As the unshaped does so, four new Emanations come into existence, each of whom has the traits of a raksha noble with a Heart Grace of 4, plus 10 experience points per dot of permanent Essence the raksha had while shaped. The unshaped's Heart Emanation retains all of the shaped raksha's former memories but has little emotional connection to them; all of the raksha's former Intimacies vanish. The other Emanations have no memories of shaped life.
   Even should the raksha then pass again through the Gateway of Sundraprisha and become shaped once more, she will be a fundamentally different character than she was in her previous shaped existence, with a new appearance and personality that are once more a gestalt of her Emanations. From the perspective of the Creation-born, passing through the Gateway of Sundraprisha is an erasure of identity, equivalent to suicide in every way that matters. Many raksha do not share this outlook, and regard with dread those Charms that may fix shaped raksha into a permanent form incapable of transition back to the glory of true formlessness.</description>

        <description>This strange Charm permits the Raksha to use bedlam as an opportunity to acquire bizarre objets d'art summoned from the unknown reaches of the Wyld itself. The Raksha can activate this Charm in the Wyld at any point before he enters bedlam, thereby gaining the benefits of the listed innate power for the duration of the tale. Alternatively, he can spend one gossamer to activate this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption to gain the following innate power for the Assumption's duration:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp; Speed: 1 dramatic action): When a Raksha who has entered bedlam while this Charm was active emerges from that state, his player rolls (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]). Success yields one or more weird and disturbing craftworks that collectively contain a number of gossamer points equal to the total successes on the roll. This gossamer can be claimed either by ravishing or simply by smashing the items recovered. At the Storyteller's discretion, an exceptional number of successes might result in an actual artifact with magical properties or perhaps an item of oneiromancy.</description>

   Waking: The raksha may twist the boundaries of an area within Creation into a reflection of the Ring - a perfect boundary with no points of entrance or egress. This Charm must be activated while the raksha stands inside of a space with well-defined boundaries no larger than (Ring x 5) yards across, at the Storyteller's discretion - a room within a building, a clearing within a forest, or a cabin within a ship, for example. So long as the raksha commits Essence to this Charm and remains within the warded area, no character outside the enchanted locale may successfully find an entrance, and no character within may successfully find an exit. This Charm fails to deter characters with appropriate shaping defenses or who wear cold iron against their skin.
   Oneiromantic benefit: Incorporated into an outward-facing glamour, this Charm prevents entrance or egress from its range of effect by anyone other than the spell's possessor.</errText>

        <description>This Charm is an obscenity to some Raksha, yet that does not deter them from using it against their enemies. When a Raksha invokes Endless Yawning Void against his enemy as part of a shaping attack, that enemy finds herself trapped within an embolism of shaped reality that springs into being around her like a cancerous cyst of crushed possibility. This Charm adds two dice to the Raksha's shaping dice pool for a Ring- or Staff-shaping action per mote spent. If the action is an attack, the Charm also adds two dice to the damage pool per each mote spent. The Raksha can spend up to his Essence in motes but must spend at least one mote. The Raksha cannot increase the dice pool for a shaping action by more than the sum of the corresponding Grace and the Raksha's Essence through any combination of Charms or effects. Other Raksha within a radius of 20 waypoints automatically sense the use of this Charm, and its use is an unambiguous threat made to every other Raksha who perceives it. Unshaped Raksha often fly into rages in response to this Charm.</description>

        <description>Generally, ranged Ring-shaping attacks and actions require ammunition, usually in the form of gossamer. Those who master this Charm are free of that limitation. Upon purchasing Luminous Exhalation, the Raksha gains the permanent ability to spend Essence in place of gossamer for purposes of any gossamer ammunition cost. The Raksha must spend two motes of Essence for every gossamer point the attack would normally have cost.</description>

        <description>This Charm builds upon its prerequisite. While Luminous Exhalation allows the Raksha only to spend Essence in place of gossamer as ammunition for Ring- or Staff-shaping attacks, this Charm allows her to convert Essence directly into gossamer, which can be used for any purpose. One point of gossamer can be created from five motes of Essence, and the transubstantiation can be performed only in the Middlemarches or deeper into the Wyld. Gossamer created through this Charm is inherently unstable and dissolves into nothingness at the end of the tale.</description>

        <description>The Raksha reaches out his will to envelop his enemy in the crushing grip of pointless custom and choking ennui, wherever she seeks to hide from him. As with Luminous Exhalation, this Charm permits the Raksha to make a ranged Ring- or Staff-shaping attack without the need for gossamer. Instead of merely replacing the cost of gossamer, however, this Charm actually lets the Raksha unleash a special ranged attack with unique traits. The attack uses the attack pool and Accuracy bonus of the Raksha's readied shaping weapon, which must have a range equal to one waypoint or higher. The base damage of this attack is (the Raksha's Perception + 10), its range is 10 waypoints, and the attack has a Speed of 4.</description>

Still, at times these substances may inconvenience the princes of chaos with paltry annoyances such as distraction, disorientation, and death. To avoid such nuisances, the raksha may activate this Charm, nullifying a Poison effect currently afflicting him. Doing so creates a small fruit of some sort in the raksha's hand - the specific form varies from raksha to raksha, with some faeries creating pomegranates while others favor apples or pears. Any individual who eats this fruit will become afflicted by the Poison effect the raksha purged from his system. If the raksha cannot convince anyone to eat the fruit within one day, it vanishes, and the Poison re-enters his system. He cannot use this Charm to remove a Poison effect again once it has re-entered his system in this fashion.</errText>

        <description>With this Charm, the Raksha invokes one of the lesser names of Nirvishesha - not one of its killing names (unless that Raksha seeks his own undoing), but still a name of power. By this mechanism, the Raksha insinuates unknown laws and forgotten principles into his enemy's being, thereby penetrating the deceptions with which that enemy shields herself. The Raksha spends the motes for this Charm and makes a Ring- or Staff-shaping attack. If the attack succeeds, this Charm allows him to ignore one point of the enemy's soak per mote spent. The Raksha cannot spend more motes in the activation of this Charm than his Essence.</description>

        <description>The Raksha dares to invoke the name Sayujya, the Great Union of Spirits, the least of Nirvishesha's killing names. As the whispered name echoes down the dimensional corridor, its reverberations seek out the Raksha's enemy to sound her doom. This Charm allows the Raksha to make a Ring- or Staff-shaping attack against a single target at a maximum range of three waypoints. This attack can be parried, but only with stunts or Charms. It cannot be dodged by any means other than Recognition of Hidden Possibilities (see p. 172). The echoes of this sound reverberate in every direction for 10 waypoints, and the Raksha's victory is often Pyrrhic. Any unshaped Raksha in the area will perceive the name of Sayujya as a call to battle... or to dinner.</description>

Targets wearing cold iron against their skin may ignore the unblockable or undodgeable quality of this attack.</errText>

            <description>These Charms assist in Ring-shaping actions and attacks. Also, since Ring-shaping attacks conceptually model ranged attacks in Creation, many of these Charms permit the Raksha to focus his shaping efforts on waypoints beyond the one within which he currently acts. Unless expressly stated otherwise, these Charms have no utility in Creation.</description>

        <description>Even an unarmed Raksha is a fearsome opponent, for his dream weapons are always at the ready. By spending one mote and one gossamer in the Wyld, the Raksha can reflexively ready any shaping weapon in his possession. Additionally, by spending one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m): The Raksha focuses the power of the Wyld through his hands, charging them with the pure destructive power of chaos for the rest of the scene. This Charm allows the Raksha to inflict lethal damage with his barehanded attacks (if he could not already do so). He can also parry lethal blows barehanded as if wielding a weapon. This power is reflexive.
   Glamour Resistance: This effect is a work of glamour. The Raksha can neither inflict lethal damage upon nor parry barehanded the lethal attacks delivered by a Creation-born whose (Stamina + Essence) is greater than the Raksha's Strength.</description>

Additionally, the raksha may spend one gossamer to reflexively ready any shaping weapon in his possession.
   At Essence 3+, the raksha gains the ability to reflexively charge her hands with the stuff of nightmares. She may pay one gossamer in step one to enhance a barehanded attack, adding +5 to its base damage. With Essence 5+ she may reflexively pay one gossamer in step one to make the damage inflicted by a barehanded attack aggravated.</description>

• One -0 health level. This costs one gossamer to activate.
• One -1 and -2 health level. This costs one gossamer to activate.
• One -2 health level. This is permanent and has no gossamer or mutation point cost.

        <description>Pity the Creation-born, who can possess only those things that already exist. This Charm permits a Raksha in Creation to forge gossamer into any mundane object he desires. The Raksha's player rolls (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]). The Raksha can create any mundane object that would normally exist in Creation provided its Resources cost does not exceed the successes on the roll. Under no circumstances can this Charm create any of the following: a living being, any item with inherent magical properties, any item forged of one of the magical materials or of cold iron, or any item with a Resources cost in excess of 5. Each application of this Charm creates a single item no bigger than a human being. Each additional point of gossamer expended doubles the size of the creation, but each application still can create only a single item. Thus, with sufficient gossamer stores a Raksha could fashion a palatial estate for himself, but one without even a single scrap of furniture. This Charm is more commonly used to create objets d'art or exceptional equipment.
   This Charm is a permanent work of glamour. Objects created by it do not provoke Glamour Resistance and are not affected by the touch of cold iron. This Charm literally transmutes gossamer into a real object of Creation.</description>

            <errText>The length of this Charm's dramatic action activation time depends on the size of the object being created. Anything intended to be used in one or two hands can be created in a mere five ticks, as can simple furniture such as a chair or small table. Elaborate furniture, statuary, and other objects up to the approximate size of a person take about a scene to create (roughly 20 minutes). Objects up to the size of a yeddim, including small vehicles such as wagons and coaches, take an hour to forge and require the expenditure of two gossamer. Items and structures up to the size of a small house, catapult or riverboat take a day to create and cost three gossamer, while larger structures and vehicles such as palaces, imperial triremes and other bluewater sailing vessels cost four gossamer and require a week of effort. Landscape-sized creations such as the Denzik City-Ship are beyond the scope of this Charm.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into an inward-facing dream for one point, permitting the raksha to reflexively call a specific pre-determined object to hand at will. It may be incorporated into an outward-facing glamour for three points, in which case the spell generates a specific pre-determined object at each interval it would take to craft it using Ordinary Object Conjuration (minimum of one object per scene).
   Mutation benefit: The abjuration or behemoth may reflexively make an (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]) roll at the appropriate difficulty to summon one particular item to hand when they wish. It may also be banished at will.</errText>

        <description>Instead of merely creating expensive items as its prerequisite allows, this Charm simply lets the Raksha become wealthy. The Raksha sends her glamour out in a coruscating wave of reality-alteration and weaves her into the narrative of local Creation in the role of a person of means. The Raksha's player rolls (Intelligence + Bureaucracy). For each success, the Raksha gains a temporary point of the Resources Background, up to a maximum equal to her Essence. The Charm doesn't just create great heaping pots of coins, it also instantly upgrades the Raksha's lifestyle to one appropriate to her new Resources rating. Her clothing becomes regal apparel, her beaten-down nag becomes a mighty steed, her tiny hovel becomes a mansion fit for a queen. The Resources acquired through this Charm can be used in any way that normal Resources could be used. If the Raksha wishes, she can maintain two separate Resources ratings: one created by this Charm for her more expensive purchases and one mundane Resources rating that is actually "real". The effects of this Charm last for one season in Creation but end early if the Raksha terminates her Assumption Charm prematurely.
   Glamour Resistance: The Resources benefits acquired through this Charm are a work of glamour. Any Creation-born can perceive the Raksha's true wealth if his (Wits + Essence) or his (Bureaucracy + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Bureaucracy. Resisting Creation-born see that the Raksha's golden raiment is naught but tarnished brass and her coins nothing but worthless pebbles. At the end of the season, the Resources boost fades, and any items acquired by the Raksha fade away, whether created through this Charm or purchased from affected mortals with the money obtained by it.</description>

            <description>These Charms permit the Raksha to tell tales of his own opulent wealth or of the wretched poverty of his adversaries. They permit a Raksha in Creation to use gossamer to create real objects... or at least objects the weak-willed can accept as real. In the same manner, these Charms can be used to tweak local reality with a touch of the Wyld so that Creation-born can lose their wealth, possessions and status. Many of these Charms can also be incorporated into oneiromancy.</description>

        <description>Creation's lore is replete with tales of wealthy and powerful mortals reduced to penury by a chance encounter with the Fair Folk. This Charm permits a Raksha to inflict a curse of poverty on one of the Creation-born. The Raksha interacts with the target, then his player rolls (Intelligence + Bureaucracy). An affected character instantly loses a number of Resources dots equal to the successes on the roll. The effects on the character's panoply are instantaneous. Each and every possession the character has that she no longer has enough Resources to justify either disappears (with other characters even forgetting she ever possessed such wealth) or is instantly ruined. Her clothes become tattered and torn. Her servants leave her, angrily complaining that they have not been paid in months. Even the most ostentatious mansion becomes a rotted, leaky hovel. As an additional side effect, the Charm inflicts a -2 external penalty on all mercantile or financial transactions of any sort between the affected being and any other Creation-born. The effects of this Charm last for one season in Creation but end early if the Raksha terminates her Assumption Charm prematurely.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It will not affect the Resources rating of any character whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Bureaucracy. All other characters will forget that the affected being was ever wealthy save for the victim herself and any characters who knew her previously whose (Perception + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Bureaucracy. The -2 penalty on transactions will not affect transactions between the victim and a merchant if the merchant has a (Wits + Essence) that exceeds the Raksha's Bureaucracy.</description>

Higher-Essence beings may not be targeted with Hateful Coin Curse, and magical possessions are never stripped away. The target's normal fortune reasserts itself at the beginning of the next story, restoring her Resources to its previous rating, unless the raksha has Essence 6+. The misfortune inflicted by such powerful Fair Folk still ends after one story, but it is up to the target to rebuild his ruined wealth.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into outward-facing glamours. It impoverishes everyone within its range of effect.</errText>

        <description>The existence of a Raksha is defined by both her purpose and her heritage. This Charm permanently ties the Raksha's Motivation to the Wyld. As a result, whenever the Raksha regains Willpower by acting on her Motivation, she gains two points of gossamer. This Charm can be purchased a number of times equal to the Raksha's Ring, with each iteration providing two more points of gossamer when the Raksha acts on her Motivation. If a Raksha acquires this Charm even once, however, she loses the ability to change her Motivation at will by dropping her Assumption.</description>

        <description>This Charm is the most basic representation of the effortless versatility inherent in Wyld-shaping and allows the Raksha to forge a mundane possession. With it, a Raksha can instantly create nearly anything he can imagine from pure Essence, subject to the following limitations. First, the object must be a mundane object. It cannot be an artifact, a shaping weapon or a living thing. It cannot be bigger than twice the size of a human being, nor can it cover a large enough area to permit two human-sized creatures to fight without environmental penalties. Once forged, the item is real and permanent within the Wyld but dissolves instantly in Creation absent the use of an Evocation Charm.
   Creating an object with this Charm requires the Raksha's player to roll (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]) as a Ring-shaping action. The difficulty of this roll is determined by the quality of the item to be created. Once evoked into Creation, a mundane possession is real for all purposes except when opposed by Glamour Resistance.
   Glamour Resistance: As a work of glamour, mundane possessions created with this Charm have no effect on Creation-born whose (Perception + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Intelligence. Against such unaffected beings, armor affords no soak bonus and weapons inflict no damage. Glamour-forged tools still function in such a being's presence, but they confer no benefits when used directly by that Creation-born or when that Creation-born acts against the one who employs a gossamer tool. If the possession is a permanent work of glamour, however, it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.
   Difficulty Description
1 Serviceable. The item is no better than what could be forged by a mortal in Creation. At the Storyteller's discretion, the Raksha might be able to imbue the item with minor super-natural properties, but at the cost of reducing its normal traits. For example, the Raksha might be able to fashion a chakram that was very good at ricocheting so that the Raksha can strike targets behind cover with a stunt. It would, however, suffer penalties to Accuracy and Damage to balance that quality.
2 Fine. The item is of fine quality. See Exalted, page 365.
3 Exceptional. The item is of exceptional quality. See Exalted, page 365.
4 Perfect. The item is of perfect quality. See Exalted, page 366.
+1 Permanence. The Raksha's possession can enter Creation without an Evocation Charm and it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits the Raksha to create truly magical objects from gossamer. The process takes far longer than Essence-Forging Art, but the effects are far superior. First, the Raksha must forge the item with a Ring-shaping action as if he were using Essence-Forging Art. Then, the Raksha must spend an amount of gossamer equal to what the Resources cost of a mundane version of the item to be created would be. The difficulty of the Ring-shaping roll is equal to the gossamer cost. The Raksha must also commit five motes to the item and let it spend an entire season absorbing the power of the Wyld.
   The result is a gossamer item. A gossamer weapon adds an additional +1 to two of the following: Accuracy, Damage, Defense or Rate. Any Strength requirement for a gossamer weapon is reduced by one. Gossamer armor has no fatigue or mobility penalties. Gossamer tools are supernally effective, adding a number of bonus dice to each use equal to the tool's gossamer cost. The preceding benefits are in addition to the benefits from forging a fine, exceptional or perfect item.
   A gossamer possession created through this Charm is always considered a permanent work of glamour, which can freely enter Creation with its owner without the need for an evocation Charm. Such possessions do not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>This Charm improves upon Gossamer-Forging Art and allows the Raksha to forge shaping weapons. Mechanically, this Charm functions like Gossamer-Forging Art except as follows. First, upon shaping the weapon into existence through a Ring-shaping action, the Raksha must spend an amount of gossamer equal to the weapon's Gossamer Background cost. She must also commit five motes to the item and let it spend an entire season absorbing the power of the Wyld. The base difficulty for the Ring-shaping action is equal to the gossamer cost of the shaping weapon to be created. If the shaping weapon is to be a fine one, increase the difficulty by two. If it is to be an exceptional one, increase it by four. If it is to be a perfect one, increase the difficulty by six. (Apply the advantages of a fine, exceptional or perfect weapon to the shaping weapon's normal traits. See Exalted, pp. 365-366, for details). The shaping weapon is a work of glamour that cannot survive in Creation absent the use of an Evocation Charm.
   Even if a shaping weapon is summoned into Creation, it has generally no utility there, as Raksha shaping actions do not affect Creation or its occupants. There are two exceptions. First, the following shaping weapons can be summoned into Creation through appropriate Evocation Charms: courtier's cauls, extras, hazards, horrors, monsters and mutant warleaders. Second, the Veil of Glamour Charm (see p. 209) permits a Raksha to shape gossamer in Creation. Veil of Glamour shaping can make use of appropriate shaping weapons.</description>

        <description>This Charm improves upon Gossamer-Forging Art and allows the Raksha to forge shaping armor, which helps to protect against shaping attacks. Mechanically, this Charm functions like Gossamer-Forging Art except as follows. First, the Raksha shapes the armor into existence through a Ring-shaping action and spends an amount of gossamer equal to the difficulty of the roll. The Raksha must also commit five motes to the item and let it spend an entire season absorbing the power of the Wyld.
   The shaping armor is a work of glamour that cannot survive in Creation absent the use of an Evocation Charm. If summoned into Creation, the armor adds its normal shaping soak bonus to the Raksha's bashing and lethal soak. This bonus soak does not apply to attacks made by Creation-born whose (attack Ability + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Craft.
   The same set of armor can serve as both shaping armor and gossamer armor, with the soak bonuses stacking, but the gossamer cost increases to twice this Charm's normal cost, and the Raksha must commit 10 motes for the duration of a season.
   Difficulty Description
1 Serviceable. The armor is the equivalent of assertion gauze.
2 Fine. The armor is the equivalent of fate weave or fine assertion gauze.
3 Exceptional. The armor is the equivalent of form chitin, fine fate weave or perfect assertion gauze. Alternatively, if the Raksha also knows Crafter's Arsenal, he can produce a courtier's call.
4 Perfect. The armor is the equivalent of perfect assertion gauze, exceptional fate weave, fine form chitin or a fine courtier's caul.
+1 Permanence. The Raksha's armor can enter Creation without an Evocation Charm, and it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>The existence of a Raksha is often the story of a journey, whether metaphorical or literal. This Charm facilitates Gossamer-Forging Art by allowing the Raksha to fashion a Wyld vessel from the raw stuff of the Wyld to speed him on his journey through infinity. A Wyld vessel is essentially a ship of some kind (conceptually analogous to ships of Creation) that permits its Raksha pilot to travel more quickly in the Wyld, as well as to transport passengers and possessions along with him.
   To craft the Wyld vessel, the Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]) as a Ring-shaping action. The Raksha must then spend a number of gossamer equal to the difficulty of the shaping roll and commit five motes of Essence for the duration of a season. The difficulty of the shaping roll is based on the characteristics of the vessel to be fashioned according to the following chart. In addition to determining size and other accouterments, each point of difficulty improves the Raksha's ability to traverse waypoints in the Wyld. Larger and more impressive ships can so intimidate other Raksha that they confer a bonus to the pilot's soak versus shaping attacks.
   A Wyld vessel is a Raksha possession that can be brought into Creation through an Evocation Charm. In Creation, a Wyld vessel is capable of transporting the Raksha (plus whatever passengers and cargo the ship can hold) at a speed of up to (difficulty rating x 50) miles per hour.
   Glamour Resistance: A Wyld vessel created through this Charm is considered a work of glamour. Unless made permanent by its creator, such a vessel cannot enter Creation without its owner using an Evocation Charm, nor can a Creation-born board the vessel as a passenger or be deterred by its defenses if the Creation-born's (Perception + Essence) exceeds the owner's Sail.
   Difficulty Description
1 Serviceable. The ship is a one-person transport vessel, sufficient to hold the pilot and those possessions that can fit on his person. When performing a Journey action as part of a flurry, the Raksha reduces the multiple action penalty by one.
2 Fine. The ship is a large vessel such as a military trireme or cargo ship capable of conveying anything from large military forces to small behemoths. When performing a Journey action as part of a flurry, the Raksha reduces the multiple action penalty by two. He also adds one to his soak against shaping attacks.
3 Exceptional. The ship is the equivalent of a medium-sized First Age vessel or a flying whale with a castle on its back. When performing a Journey action as part of a flurry, the Raksha reduces the multiple action penalty by two, and the Raksha can cover two waypoints during a Journey action instead of just one. The vessel also adds two to the Raksha's soak against shaping attacks.
4 Perfect. The ship is a greater behemoth that carries the Raksha's palace on its shoulders or the equivalent of one of the titanic vessels of the First Age. When performing a Journey action as part of a flurry, the Raksha reduces the multiple action penalty by three, and the Raksha can cover three waypoints during a Journey action instead of just one. The vessel also adds three to the Raksha's soak against shaping attacks. It can also be used as a monster for purposes of Sword-shaping but gains a +1 bonus to two separate traits of the Raksha's choice (one of which can include reducing the monster's Speed by one).
+1 Permanence. The Raksha's Wyld vessel can enter Creation without an Evocation Charm, and it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

If it travels through the air, add one to the difficulty cost of making it a permanent work of glamour. If it is capable of multiple means of locomotion, add one to the difficulty cost of making it a permanent work of glamour for each means of locomotion beyond the first. Vessels created with this Charm travel at a speed of up to (difficulty rating x 10) miles per hour, not (difficulty rating x 50).

        <description>Having mastered the shaping of things, the Raksha now progresses to the crafting of places. This Charm permits a Raksha to use a shaping Charm to craft the landscape of an area of the Wyld up to one waypoint in size into a Raksha territory. The Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]) as a Ring-shaping action against a waypoint he possesses. The difficulty is determined both by the size of the territory to be created and the degree to which the shaped territory satisfies all the Raksha's material needs. While in the Wyld, a Raksha territory can theoretically be as big as its creator wishes. When a Creation-born enters the territory, however, and attempts to traverse it through Charms, the territory is conceptually reduced to a maximum diameter of 30 miles, and most territories are much smaller than that.A Raksha territory created through this Charm is considered a possession of its creator and can be summoned into Creation through an Evocation Charm. When used to evoke a territory into Creation, however, all Essence and gossamer costs associated with the Evocation Charm are increased by the difficulty originally needed to shape the Raksha territory.
   Evoking a Raksha's territory into Creation does not literally rewrite local reality into the territory as it existed in the Wyld. Rather, the evocation changes local reality so that it resembles the milieu of the original territory with only important landmarks of the Wyld literally translated into reality. Affected regions of Creation thus resemble strange amalgamations of reality and Raksha territory. A farmer in an affected area might be surprised to discover that everything on his farm was now colored bright pink including the clothes on his back. The farm itself, however, would remain largely unchanged by the evocation... except for the 40-story pink crystal palace that now stands in the farmer's cornfield.
   Glamour Resistance: When a Raksha territory is evoked into Creation, the evocation is considered a work of glamour. Living things within the affected area are always unaffected absent the use of other Charms, and items that are physically in the possession of a Creation-born within the region remain unaffected if the Creation-born's (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Craft. Glamour Resistance does not apply to permanent Raksha territories, but even then, living beings caught within the transformed area are not personally affected absent the use of other Charms.
   Difficulty Description
1 Serviceable. The Raksha territory is a simple landscape or home -a meadow, a swamp or a small manor house. For Creation-born attempting to traverse it in the Wyld, it has a maximum diameter of one mile. If summoned into Creation, the evocation affects a maximum area of just under 10,000 square yards (about two acres). Only a few simple thematic elements are translated into Creation, enough to turn the skies green, for example.
2 Fine. The Raksha territory is large enough for a palace with spacious grounds or a landscape comparable to a small to medium-sized forest. For Creation-born attempting to traverse it in the Wyld, it has a maximum diameter of eight miles. If summoned into Creation, the evocation affects a maximum area of about three square miles. One or two geographic features or landmarks can be translated across wholesale. Several significant thematic elements can be incorporated into the area, enough to give all animals the power of speech, for example.
3 Exceptional. The Raksha territory is an enormous place complete with entire towns populated by the Raksha lord's servants and playthings. Less developed territories might include a large forest or swamp or a small lake or desert. For Creation-born attempting to traverse it in the Wyld, it has a maximum diameter of 15 miles. If summoned into Creation, the evocation affects a maximum area of about 20 square miles. The area is dominated by bizarre landmarks, disturbing geographic features and impossible weather phenomena (although none are harmful to local Creation-born residents absent other Charms such as Translucent Dream Sheathing Technology). Several highly sophisticated thematic elements can be introduced into an affected part of Creation, such as applying a consistent color scheme to all objects in the area or surrounding the Creation-born caught within the territory with all the trappings of some arcane Raksha holiday.
4 Perfect. The Raksha territory is a small nation with multiple cities that venerate the Raksha lord as a god-king. Less developed territories might be the equivalent of Creation's largest forests, seas or deserts. For Creation-born attempting to traverse the territory in the Wyld, it has a maximum diameter of 30 miles. It is currently impossible to evoke a perfect Raksha territory into Creation, as the Realm Defense Grid's automated systems would swat it down instantly. During the Balorian Crusade, when the Grid was initially inactive, the Fair Folk evoked perfect territories throughout Creation to serve as beachheads for the unshaped Raksha who followed.
+1 Permanence. The Raksha's territory can enter Creation without an Evocation Charm, and it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>Previous Wyld-shaping Charms permit the Raksha to dazzle Creation-born who enter her domain with works of glamour. This Charm allows her to directly affect or even harm them. The Raksha targets an existing possession (an item, a vessel or a territory) with this Charm and imbues it with an inherent glamour effect that inflicts an automatic predetermined shaping effect on those who interact with it. This Charm can be reflexively used in tandem with Essence-Forging Art, Gossamer-Forging Art, Unreal Ship-wright's Method or Principle of Worlds without the need for a Combo, and all motes spent are committed until the item being forged is completed (usually one season). If the Charm is used to enchant a previously existing possession, the Raksha must commit the motes to the item for one season, at the end of which the shaping effect becomes a part of the possession's nature.
   In order to enact this Charm, the Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]) as a Ring-shaping action. The difficulty for the roll is determined by the nature of the shaping effect to be imbued into the possession. This difficulty also determines the gossamer cost for activating the Charm. Particular effects are described as being serviceable, fine, exceptional or perfect, depending on the difficulty applied. The Essence spent on this Charm must remain committed for one tale as appropriate while the Raksha carefully sculpts the effect into the desired shape.
   Generally, if a Raksha applies a shaping effect to a possession and then carries it into Creation, the shaping effect goes dormant unless the possession is brought to Creation through an Evocation Charm or the shaping effect is made permanent. Making a shaping effect permanent through this Charm adds one to the Charm's difficulty.
   From a narrative standpoint, the shaping effect establishes a condition associated with the possession such that anyone who interacts with the item must abide by the normal rules for acceding to or ignoring shaping effects (see p. 117). For example, a Raksha might enchant a particular bed in her castle with an exceptional effect (difficulty 3) that states that anyone who laid down on it would fall asleep until "awoken by love's true kiss". If an intruder did lie down on the bed, he would treat the effect as if it were a shaping effect suc-cessfully used against him by a Raksha with an Essence of 3. In other words, he could either submit to the condition and fall asleep until awoken (thereby gaining a +1 Wyld bonus on all actions while a part of the narrative) or he could spend one Willpower to ignore it and thereafter suffer a -3 Wyld penalty on all future actions for the duration of the tale. If  the Raksha summons the item into Creation, the Wyld bonus and Wyld penalty last for one season (or until the Raksha's Assumption ends).
   Instead of first creating an item through Essence-Forging Art, Principle of Worlds or Unreal Shipwright's Method and then applying this Charm to it, the Raksha has the option of simply creating the object wholesale from Translucent Dream Sheathing Technology. Doing so doubles the Essence and gossamer cost and adds one to the difficulty. A gossamer object cannot be directly created with this Charm.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. In the Wyld, its effects function against the Creation-born normally. If the enchanted item is evoked into Creation, the shaping effect attached to it by this Charm continues to function, but its condition does not apply at all to any Creation-born whose (Integrity + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Intelligence.
   Difficulty Description
1 Serviceable. This is a simple shaping effect. It can be overcome by a Charm or a stunt, and any opposing shaping effect defeats it automatically. Otherwise, it inflicts a -1 Wyld penalty on anyone who defies the condition inherent in the shaping effect. Such a person must also pay one Willpower if it is the first violation of local reality during the scene. At this level of difficulty, the shaping effect must be targeted on single object small enough to fit into a 10'-by-10' room.
2 Fine. The Raksha's shaping effect can impose a -2 Wyld penalty on anyone who defies the condition. Alternatively, he can impose a -1 penalty on a location small enough fit within a serviceable Raksha territory.
3 Exceptional. The Raksha's shaping effect can impose a -3 Wyld penalty on anyone who defies the condition. Alternatively, he can impose a -2 penalty on a location small enough to fit into a serviceable Raksha territory or a -1 penalty on fine Raksha territory.
4 Perfect. The Raksha's shaping effect can impose a -4 Wyld penalty on anyone who defies the condition. Alternatively, he can impose a -3 penalty on a serviceable Raksha territory, a -2 penalty on a fine territory or a -1 penalty on an exceptional territory.
+1 Direct Creation. The Raksha shapes the possession and the shaping effect attached to it simultaneously as a single Ring-shaping action instead of simply applying the shaping effect to a pre-existing possession. This technique also increases the Essence cost by two.
+1 Permanence. The Raksha's shaping effect can enter Creation if the Raksha evokes the item or territory to which it is attached. Even permanent shaping effects are still subject to Glamour Resistance.</description>

            <name>Shaping Stances</name>
            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.
   The styles that follow are those most commonly known and understood.</description>

Associated with Ring-shaping combat, the God-Monster teaches those Workers who follow his path to transcend all notions of restraint that stand in the way of apotheosis. A Raksha who plays the part of the All-Consuming God-Monster must never channel his Temperance during a shaping combat or else he will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the God-Monster must comport himself as a rampaging, brutish monster. In doing so, he must define one vice he will pursue at every opportunity and never try to resist. Whenever he does choose to resist that chosen vice, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of his current tale.</description>

            <description>All things are possible to the God-Monster, for he devours impossibility along with his enemies. While this Charm is active, whenever the raksha gains stunt dice, he adds one to the number of dice rolled. This does not increase his Essence or Willpower rewards. This Charm may be used in either Creation or the Wyld; the raksha must decide at the time of the Charm's activation whether it will enhance stunted shaping actions or stunted non-shaping actions.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.

        <description>Self-preservation is no defense against the hunger of the God-Monster, but the Raksha can choose to let the God-Monster devour only a portion of her that she wishes to lose. This Charm allows the Raksha to cut a Charm or a trait out of her own existence without otherwise damaging her form or the array of Charms that support it. Each time this Charm is activated, the Raksha permanently loses either one dot of a chosen trait or one specific Charm. If a Charm consumed by Spirit-Flaying Meditation was one that also caused the Raksha to gain one or more permanent mutations, those mutations are removed as well, as are any mutation points the Raksha carried as part of that Charm's cost. The Raksha receives no other benefit for using this Charm, which is the only means by which a Raksha can rid herself of permanent mutations. The Raksha must be in the Wyld to invoke this Charm.</description>

In the Wyld, the Raksha spends one mote and two gossamer. For the duration of a shaping battle, the Raksha adds one to her DV against all shaping attacks. She also adds her highest feeding Virtue in dice to any rolls to avoid detection by others in the Wyld. Additionally, by spending two gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption, the Raksha gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m): The Raksha adds her highest feeding Virtue in dice to all Stealth rolls.

        <description>Assuming the stance of the God-Monster, the Raksha allows it to devour him, even as he devours it. From their mad dance of mutual consumption, a new and terrifying shape emerges. The shape is called the "God-Monster Body", and this Charm brings it forth. When a Raksha purchases this Charm, he receives three benefits, which his player must choose immediately from the list above. A shaped Raksha can purchase this Charm only once. An unshaped Raksha can do so a number of times equal to half its Essence, with each subsequent iteration of the Charm granting two benefits.
   Customarily, this Charm is not compatible with any Assumption Charm, so a shaped Raksha cannot activate All-Consuming God-Monster Stance while in Creation or maintain it while passing from the Wyld into Creation. The benefit Calling upon the Dragon's Ire negates this limitation, and those Raksha who possess it can unleash their God-Monster Body on an unsuspecting Creation.
   This is a Stance-type Charm. A character cannot use more than one Stance-type Charm at a time, and activating a new stance terminates the previous one.</description>

            <description>The All-Consuming God-Monster is a creature ruled by its passions and appetites, a rampaging and unrestricted id given form. Associated with Ring-shaping combat, the God-Monster teaches those Workers who follow his path to transcend all notions of restraint that stand in the way of apotheosis. A Raksha who plays the part of the All-Consuming God-Monster must never channel his Temperance during a shaping combat or else he will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the God-Monster must comport himself as a rampaging, brutish monster. In doing so, he must define one vice he will pursue at every opportunity and never try to resist. Whenever he does choose to resist that chosen vice, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of his current tale.</description>

        <description>A Raksha who terminates his Gateway of Sundraprisha Charm returns to the status of unshaped but still continues to exist... after a fashion. A Raksha who activates this Charm leaves nothing behind. This Charm permits the Raksha to instantly destroy her Heart Grace wherever it is and regard-less of who possesses it. In the process, it utterly destroys the Raksha, unleashing the raw power of her former existence into a coruscating (and probably tremendous) explosion of Wyld energy. This Charm is a plot device, having such limited or limitless effects as the Storyteller desires. At a minimum, the resultant explosion might totally destroy an unshaped Raksha of at least moderate size or vaporize an unoccupied waypoint.</description>

If the offspring journeys into Creation, the Emanation must expend two additional gossamer to experience his life.</description>

The Emanation must already have Reflected Glory and Father's Commanding Voice active to activate this Charm, paying 10 motes and two Willpower for an offspring in the Wyld (plus two gossamer if the offspring is in Creation). While Extravagant Birthday Reward is active, the Emanation's child can draw upon the Emanation's spiritual and metaphysical resources, allowing her to spend the Emanation's Essence, Willpower, gossamer and even Virtue channels in place of her own.</description>

Alternatively, she can spend one gossamer to activate this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption to gain the following innate power for the Assumption's duration:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): When the Raksha enters bedlam, he can reflexively activate this power. For the duration of the bedlam, the Raksha adds three automatic successes on all non-shaping Virtue rolls that help her keep or fulfill an oath.</description>

A Raksha who defeats her enemy in a Staff-shaping contest has the option of inflicting Cup-, Ring- or Sword-shaping damage in the future. Accordingly, many Charms from the Shaping Combat cascades of those Graces can also benefit Staff attacks and actions, and Diplomats who engage in shaping combat typically study the shaping combat approach associated with one of those Graces. There are only two exclusive Staff-Shaping Combat Charms.</description>

        <description>Drawing upon her understanding of the Staff, the Raksha forges dreams and fancies into living things to serve her. This Charm permits the Raksha to create a lesser minion. Such creatures have no Motivation other than to serve their mistress. They have an Essence of 1 and no Willpower at all.
   In order to create a minion with this Charm, the Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Socialize) as a Staff-shaping action. If the roll is successful, the Raksha instantly creates either a minion animal or a non-sentient humanoid minion servant. If the minion has a humanoid form, this Charm grants it three dots in the Craft or Performance Ability of its creator's choice. If the minion is an animal, the Charm grants it one extra dot in the Physical Attribute of its creator's choice. These benefits are in addition to those outlined in the chart according to the difficulty level of the shaping effect. The extreme versatility of this Charm permits a player to define her minion in terms of the hazard it represents pursuant to the "Knowing the Opposition" section in Exalted, page 247.
   A minion created through this Charm can be summoned into Creation through an Evocation Charm but otherwise is incapable of entering Creation unless made permanent.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. A minion created by it cannot harm or otherwise affect a Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Socialize. If the minion is made permanent, Glamour Resistance does not apply.
   Difficulty Description
1 Serviceable. The minion has the traits of a citizen (see Exalted, pp. 278-279) or an animal comparable in utility to a horse. The minion represents Hazard 0.
2 Fine. The minion has the traits of an elite soldier (see Exalted, p. 280) or an animal with combat training comparable to a war dog. The minion represents a Hazard •.
3 Exceptional. The minion has the traits of a powerful mortal hero (but still not true self-awareness - see Exalted, p. 280) or an animal comparable to a claw strider or great cat. The minion represents Hazard ••.
4 Perfect. The minion has traits roughly comparable to a God-Blood (but still not true self-awareness - see Exalted, pp. 281-282) or an animal comparable to a tyrant lizard. The minion represents Hazard •••.
+1 Permanence. The minion can enter Creation at its master's bidding without the use of an Evocation Charm, and it does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>As per Awakened Dream Manufacture, except as follows. First, it takes the Raksha a full story to properly fashion his minion. Second, the Raksha must spend five motes instead of three, plus up to his Socialize in gossamer. For each point of gossamer spent, the minion gains one mutation point, the effects of which are incorporated into its structure. The Raksha chooses the mutations to be applied.
   A minion created through this Charm can be summoned into Creation through an Evocation Charm, or it can enter Creation freely if it is made permanent or if one of its mutations is a permanent Assumption Charm. Otherwise, it is incapable of surviving in Creation.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. A minion created by it cannot harm or otherwise affect a Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Socialize. If the minion is created to be permanent or has a permanent Assumption Charm mutation, Glamour Resis-tance does not apply.</description>

        <description>This Charm binds a small creature of the Wyld to the Raksha. A valid target for this Charm cannot represent a Hazard rating greater than ••, and if it already has a Heart Grace, that trait cannot exceed 1. If these conditions are met, the Raksha can bind the creature to it as a familiar. The creature's prior Heart Grace, if it had one, is destroyed, and the creature is thereafter bound to the Raksha's own Heart instead. Mechanically, each use of this Charm allows the Raksha to acquire a one-dot familiar. If the targeted creature would represent a familiar rated higher than one dot, the Raksha can still use the Charm, but his control over the familiar is incomplete until he spends enough experience to completely pay for its value (one experience point per dot of Familiar). The Raksha can use this Charm to create a familiar out of one of his own minions.</description>

            <name>Grace-Forging Charms</name>
            <description>These Charms represent the greater arts of glamour-crafting. Many of these Charms permit the Raksha to create Graces for either minions or Creation-born, allowing them to interact with the Wyld at a level commensurate with the Fair Folk. Charms used to forge new Graces are considered Charms of the Staff, but they require a minimum Staff of 0. Theoretically, a lesser Raksha without a Staff Grace can learn the appropriate Charm and forge a Staff Grace for himself. Other Charms permit a Raksha to forge an existing Grace he has acquired into new forms and functions, such as into artifacts or the bonefire of a freehold. Except where stated otherwise, none of the Charms listed here permit Glamour Resistance. These Charms insinuate fundamental aspects of the shinma themselves into Creation-born targets, which utterly defeats all such resistance. More information on the process for forging Graces can be found on pages 92 to 93.</description>

            <description>These Charms represent the greater arts of glamour-crafting. Many of these Charms permit the Raksha to create Graces for either minions or Creation-born, allowing them to interact with the Wyld at a level commensurate with the Fair Folk. Charms used to forge new Graces are considered Charms of the Staff, but they require a minimum Staff of 0. Theoretically, a lesser Raksha without a Staff Grace can learn the appropriate Charm and forge a Staff Grace for himself. Other Charms permit a Raksha to forge an existing Grace he has acquired into new forms and functions, such as into artifacts or the bonefire of a freehold. Except where stated otherwise, none of the Charms listed here permit Glamour Resistance. These Charms insinuate fundamental aspects of the shinma themselves into Creation-born targets, which utterly defeats all such resistance. More information on the process for forging Graces can be found on pages 92 to 93.</description>

        <description>Having learned to forge new Graces for visitors to his realm, the Raksha, in keeping with his duties as host, provides them with a repast fit for a king. With this Charm, the Raksha can pry open the Cup, Ring, Staff or Sword Grace of a creature who has acquired such a Grace by some means. Thereafter, the targeted creature can treat said Grace as a feeding Grace, and the creature can learn the Charm Ravishing the Created Form, as well as any other Feeding Charms for which the creature meets all prerequisites.
   The maximum number of feeding Graces any character can acquire after character creation is equal to (her Heart Grace - 1). A minion for whom a Cup, Ring, Staff and Sword Grace have been formed and who has at least one opened feeding Grace is truly considered a Raksha.</description>

        <description>Like a cruel master striking a bowl of rice from his starving worker's hands, this Charm allows the Raksha to deprive his enemies of the opportunity to gain sustenance. The Raksha can seal over an enemy's feeding Grace with a successful Staff-shaping attack. The target need not be within the Raksha's immediate vicinity but must be within one waypoint. If the Staff-shaping attack succeeds, it inflicts no damage. Instead, the target must double the Essence cost of all Charms associated with the muzzled Grace until she can reopen it by some means (such as Gaping Virtue Mouth).
   In addition, a Raksha who spends one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm gains the following innate power while in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m, 1g; Speed: 4) The Raksha can fling one point of gossamer at a Creation-born enemy, clogging the target's Essence-gathering organs with a miasma of confused impossibility on a successful hit. In order to do so, the Raksha's player must successfully roll (Intelligence + Thrown) against the target's DV. This attack can be dodged, but it is unblockable absent perfect defenses. If the attack is successful, the target doubles all Essence costs for Charms and other magical effects for one scene per extra success on the attack roll.
   Glamour Resistance: The Staff-shaping attack aspect of this Charm has no Glamour Resistance. By definition, any creature who has consented to receiving a feeding Grace is vulnerable to this Charm. The innate power aspect of the Charm, however, is a work of glamour that cannot affect any Creation-born whose (Occult + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Thrown.</description>

   Waking: The raksha shapes a bit of gossamer into an entangling and restrictive set of obscure metaphysical laws, then hurls it into an opponent's Essence flows. If the raksha succeeds on a physical or social attack enhanced by this Charm, her target adds one mote to the Essence cost of all Charms for one scene. With Staff 6+, Essence 6+ this penalty lasts for one week. With Staff 7+, Essence 7+ it lasts for one season. Staff 10, Essence 10 renders this Charm's penalty permanent unless repaired with anti-Crippling magic.</errText>

        <description>By these means are many of the Raksha nobility summoned into being. The Raksha opens himself up to the Wyld and for an instant, they become as one. From this union, a new Raksha is summoned into existence, her Heart Grace coming instantly and inevitably into her Raksha parent's hand.
   In order to give birth to a new Raksha, the character's player rolls (Intelligence + Occult) as a Staff-shaping action. The difficulty for birthing a commoner Raksha is 5. For heroic commoners, the difficulty is 7, and for nobles, it is 9. This roll is not an extended one. If the shaping action succeeds, the Raksha creates the desired Fair Folk, which has all five Graces (an appropriate number of which are feeding Graces). The Raksha who gave birth possesses and owns all of his child's Graces. Botching the shaping action creates a deformed or possibly insane child or even a monster, one who owns her own Graces and despises her Raksha parent.</description>

Ecstatic Reproduction Style may create commoners no more than once per week, heroic commoners no more than once per season, and noble raksha no more than once per year. Commoners created through this Charm may not have Birth ratings higher than 2. Heroic commoners cannot have Birth ratings higher than 4. The Storyteller defines the precise traits of raksha created through this Charm, though the character using Ecstatic Reproduction Style may define very general parameters for what he is trying to create (for example, "a heroic Entertainer musician", or "a noble Cataphract swordswoman").
   This Charm may not be used to create a noble by a raksha who does not own his Heart.</errText>

        <description>The Raksha draws upon the name of Nirvikalpa, which she uses to sanctify an oath between two other Fair Folk through the birthing of a child from their union. The Charm permits one Raksha to draw the Essence of two other consenting Fair Folk into herself and manipulate it to create a child. Each of the two parents (the gender of whom is irrelevant) must make an oath to one another, while the Raksha who enacts this Charm must make a third oath in the child's name. The oath-child, as he is called, is bound from birth to the oath sworn in his name, while his parents are bound to the oaths sworn to each other while that child still lives. Treaties among the Fair Folk are often sealed with the birthing of a new Raksha through this Charm.
   Both of the parents can contribute to the activation of this Charm with Essence, gossamer and experience. The oath-child possesses his own Heart, Ring and Sword Graces, while one of his parents takes ownership of his Cup Grace and the other one his Staff Grace. If one of the parents is Raksha, the child is Raksha. If one is noble, the child is au-tomatically noble.</description>

            <errText>This Charm's participants need not necessarily be raksha. If neither parent is raksha, then both parents are bound by the oaths sworn as though they were Fair Folk. The child is whatever would normally be produced by such a union (human in the case of two mortals, demon-blooded if the oath is sworn between a human and a demon, and so on), and is born oathbound. Children born of impossible parentage, such as between a human and a Dragon King, may be created, and will come into existence as a child of the same type as one parent or the other, at the discretion of the raksha using this Charm; the child is likely to possess an interesting mutation or two to reflect their bizarre heritage. Non-raksha children created through this Charm are born with Cup, Ring, Staff and Sword Graces. A character may not act as a "parent" for this Charm's purposes more than once per year.
   A raksha who does not own his own Heart cannot be compelled into creating an oath-child.</errText>

        <description>This Charm permits the Raksha to embed the Heart Grace of a consenting creature in the center of an uncapped demesne within Creation or into a waypoint he controls in the Wyld. A silver, heatless bonefire soon erupts from the site where the Grace is embedded, transforming the entire demesne or waypoint into a freehold. The rules governing the forging of a freehold are more fully described on pages 139-140.</description>

            <description>These Charms represent the greater arts of glamour-crafting. Many of these Charms permit the Raksha to create Graces for either minions or Creation-born, allowing them to interact with the Wyld at a level commensurate with the Fair Folk. Charms used to forge new Graces are considered Charms of the Staff, but they require a minimum Staff of 0. Theoretically, a lesser Raksha without a Staff Grace can learn the appropriate Charm and forge a Staff Grace for himself. Other Charms permit a Raksha to forge an existing Grace he has acquired into new forms and functions, such as into artifacts or the bonefire of a freehold. Except where stated otherwise, none of the Charms listed here permit Glamour Resistance. These Charms insinuate fundamental aspects of the shinma themselves into Creation-born targets, which utterly defeats all such resistance.

        <description>This Charm represents the pinnacle of the shaping arts: forging artifacts directly from the Graces of other Raksha. These are actually four separate Charms, each of which must be purchased separately.
   Great Works of the Cup: The Raksha forges a Cup Grace into an oneiromantic spell (see pp. 136-138).
   Great Works of the Ring: The Raksha forges a Ring Grace into a treasure (see pp. 138-139).
   Great Works of the Staff: The Raksha forges a Staff Grace into an adjuration (see pp. 133-135).
   Great Works of the Sword: The Raksha forges a Sword Grace into a behemoth (see pp. 135-136).
   A commoner Raksha's Grace yields a one-dot artifact, and a noble Grace can yield a two-dot artifact. In either case, an artifact forged through this Charm remains a Grace for its original bearer. Its physical manifestation simply changes to that of the newly created artifact, whose owner now also has dominion over the connected Grace. Any character attuned to such an artifact can inflict the appropriate bedlam curse on the bearer of the Grace as a reflexive action. Once any particular Grace has been shaped through one of these Charms, it becomes an invalid target for future uses of the same Charm. An artifact rated at three dots or higher cannot be forged through this Charm unless the Raksha has first succeeded in a quest against an unshaped (see the rules outlined beginning on p. 60).
   The Raksha who seeks to forge the Grace must choose the nature, power level and properties of the artifact to be created, and he must acquire the proper Grace. His player then rolls (Intelligence + Occult) as an extended Staff-shaping action against a threshold difficulty determined by the artifact's rating. Each roll represents one tale, and the Raksha must leave the Essence committed to the Charm until the artifact is forged. The total number of threshold successes needed to forge the artifact is as follows.
    Artifact Difficulty Total Successes Needed
• 3 10
•• 4 30
••• 5 60
•••• 6 100
••••• 7 200
   Glamour Resistance: The artifact forged with this Charm is a permanent work of glamour that can be transported into Creation without the need for an Evocation Charm. Accordingly, Glamour Resistance cannot defend against the artifact, which is considered real for all purposes.</description>

        <description>Instead of forging new artifacts from Graces, this Charm permits the Raksha to redefine the parameters of the shaping effect that defines a preexisting artifact. In other words, the Raksha can reshape an existing artifact according to her wishes. This is actually a cluster of four Charms, one for each Grace, each of which must be learned separately. The Grace this Charm represents must match the Grace represented by its prerequisite.
   Unshaped Cup Transformation: The Raksha reshapes an existing oneiromantic spell.
   Unshaped Ring Transformation: The Raksha reshapes an existing treasure.
   Unshaped Staff Transformation: The Raksha reshapes an existing adjuration.
   Unshaped Sword Transformation: The Raksha reshapes an existing behemoth.
   In order to reshape the artifact, the Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Occult) as a Staff-shaping action. This Charm cannot manipulate a Wyld-forged artifact with a rating above 5. The roll is an extended one, with each roll representing one story's worth of shaping. Once reforged, the new artifact is a permanent artifact subject to the same Glamour Resistance strictures as in Great Works of the (Grace). The artifact's rating will remain the same - only through questing can an artifact's rating actually be improved. The difficulty for each roll is equal to the artifact's rating, and the total number of threshold successes needed for a successful shaping is as follows:
    Artifact Rating Total Threshold Successes Needed
• 3
•• 5
••• 10
•••• 30
••••• 60
   As always, the Storyteller has final approval on what artifacts the Raksha can forge with this Charm. This Charm can also be used to repair damaged artifacts or even resurrect slain behemoths. When used in that capacity, the difficulty of each roll is reduced by one, to a minimum of 1.</description>

        <description>This Charm permits a Raksha to incorporate any Creation-born she encounters in the Wyld directly into her narrative, casting him into the role of a minor behemoth. The Raksha can impose one or more mutations on a Creation-born encountered within the Wyld. The Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Occult) as a Staff-shaping action. A single success is enough to change the Creation-born's cosmetic appearance, and for every two successes rolled, the Raksha can impose one point's worth of mutations on him. Creation-born with an Essence of 1 can serve as minor shaping weapons. The Raksha can attune to any behemoth she forges and use it in Sword-shaping combat. Such a minor behemoth typically has the traits of a basic non-artifact Sword-shaping weapon (such as a horror, a mutant warleader and so forth). For each dot of Essence the affected Creation-born has in excess of 1, the Raksha can either raise one of the behemoth's shaping weapon traits by one point or add an additional point of mutation. Mutants with 10 or more mutation points qualify as one-dot fey beasts (Artifact •).
   The behemoth is considered a permanent work of glamour that can be brought into Creation without the need for an Evocation Charm. While in Creation, the behemoth is under the total control of the Fair Folk who forged it.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour and cannot transform any Creation-born whose (Stamina + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Intelligence into a behemoth. Once so transformed, however, the behemoth is considered a permanent work of glamour, and if its owner directs it to attack Creation-born beings, such attacks do not provoke Glamour Resistance in its victims.</description>

            <description>This Charm permits a raksha to incorporate a mortal into her narrative, casting him into the role of a Wyld-shaped horror or minor behemoth. The raksha can impose one or more mutations on a mortal target with a successful (Intelligence + Occult) Staff-shaping attack. The raksha may inflict two points of mutations (see Exalted, p. 288) per dot of Essence she possesses. Positive mutations are gained as a Training effect. Mutants with 10 or more points of mutations qualify as one-dot fey beasts, and may be attuned to and used as such if the raksha can successfully break their will. Mutants attuned to in this fashion become loyal to the raksha as though they were summoned demons.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into an outward-facing glamour, launching a staff-shaping attack (even in Creation) at any mortal who takes a certain predefined action within the spell’s range of effect once per scene.</description>

        <description>The Raksha achieves a perfected understanding of Nirvikalpa and redefines his own role in the drama of the Wyld. Upon activating this Charm, the Raksha shapes himself into a Wyld artifact. The Charm destroys the Raksha's Heart and Ring Graces instantly, along with her volition and awareness of self. She loses her Motivation and cannot spend Willpower for any purpose. She also loses the capacity to use any Charms of the Ring. Even though the Raksha no longer has a Ring Grace, however, she does not suffer the Curse of Namelessness, nor does she cease to exist.Instead, the Raksha becomes a sentient, if unmotivated, Wyld artifact under the total control of the first Raksha to attune to her. Attunement costs one mote and requires six scenes of interaction. Once attuned, the other Raksha can command the character as if in possession of her Heart Grace.
   Raksha who become artifacts through this Charm gain the following benefits.
• The artifact ignores all shaping damage.
• The artifact gains +6L/6B soak against all attacks.
• The artifact becomes unbreakable, automatically converting all lethal damage to bashing damage before applying soak, unless the attack could damage one of the magical materials.
• If the Raksha is slain in Creation, the artifact can be repaired as if it were a three-dot artifact.
• The Raksha gains the benefits of the Mad God Mien Charm (see pp. 160-161).
   An artifact created through this Charm is a permanent work of glamour that may be carried into Creation without an Evocation Charm and that does not provoke Glamour Resistance among Creation-born.</description>

The relationship can be anything - true love, bitter rivalry, an ongoing prank war, a hunter-prey relationship, et cetera. In every story in which the Raksha actively pursues the relationship, he gains one bonus gossamer. If the Raksha ever permanently ends the relationship, however, it instantly destroys his Staff Grace.</description>

        <description>The Raksha's panache is so perfect, so effortless, so gallant, that it is impossible to refuse him. The Raksha spends five motes and three gossamer, and his player rolls (Charisma + Socialize) as a Staff-shaping attack. If the attack is successful, the Raksha can then add his Charisma to its raw damage. Additionally, a Raksha who spends three gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m, 1wp): In Creation, a Raksha can use Beguilement to instill obedience in Creation-born through nothing more than his natural Ã©lan. This power, once activated, lasts for a scene, and during that time, any Creation-born the Raksha encounters will accede to the Raksha's most outrageous demands. She will not kill herself at his command or engage in any clearly suicidal course, but she can be persuaded to give him all her warm clothing in the middle of a blizzard; she will consent to being ravished or allowing her loved ones to be so violated; she will hurl herself into battle against the Raksha's enemies, no matter how terrifying. Once activated, Beguilement affects every Creation-born the Raksha encounters during the scene who is not protected by Glamour Resistance. Upon activating this power, the Raksha's player must roll (Charisma + Socialize), and the effects of the Charm on ensorcelled characters will continue for one additional scene per success.
   Glamour Resistance: Beguilement is a work of glamour. It automatically fails if the target's (Wits + Essence) or Willpower exceeds the Raksha's Charisma. Also, Beguilement is a power carried through the Raksha's voice and the power cannot be used in battle or on characters who cannot or will not listen, such as an angry mob.</description>

        <description>The Raksha wields rumors, lies and the natural human tendency to scapegoat others as a subtle but powerful attack against his enemies. When used in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, Spite-Summoning Malediction confers upon the Raksha the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 1m; Speed: One long tick): The Raksha must interact with the target socially and spend one mote. Then, his player rolls (Charisma + Socialize) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. This roll can benefit from Charms that improve Staff-shaping attacks and actions. If the roll is successful, the Charm causes the target to gain enemies at a frightening rate. For each extra success, the target loses one dot in one of the following Backgrounds (chosen by the Raksha's player): Allies, Backing, Contacts, Followers, Influence or Mentor. If the successes exceed the target's points in those Backgrounds, the target also gains one or more meaningful enemies who actively oppose the target.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot negate the Backgrounds of a Creation-born whose (Socialize + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Charisma, nor can it cause specific allies, contacts, followers or mentors whose (Socialize + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Charisma to turn against the affected person.</description>

            <description>The raksha wields rumors, lies and the natural human tendency to scapegoat others as a subtle but powerful attack against his enemies. He must interact with his target socially and then use this Charm while touching the target. The raksha rolls (Charisma + Socialize) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence; this roll may be enhanced by Charms that improve Staff-shaping attacks. If successful, the target loses the raksha's Essence in dots of Allies, Backing, Contacts, Followers, Influence and Mentor. This Charm cannot influence the behavior of Essence-users, so if the character's Mentor is an ancient Sidereal, the raksha cannot reduce that Background. Mortals cannot resist this Charm by spending Willpower, but its effect upon their behavior is an Illusion and may be treated as such if the character attempts to intervene to preserve his reputation. The character's Backgrounds automatically restore themselves to their previous levels at the beginning of the next story, unless the raksha has Essence 6+.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm may be incorporated into outward-facing glamours. It alienates those who take a particular pre-defined action within the range of its effect.</description>

        <description>Calling upon the power of the Staff and the birthright of the Raksha that it represents, this Charm permits a Raksha to assert her dominance over lesser creatures of chaos. The Raksha incorporates a mutation into herself that demands obedience from any beings she encounters who have been touched by the Wyld. The Charm confers the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 8m, 1wp): Whenever the Raksha interacts with any Creation-born human or animal that possesses at least one Wyld mutation, with any natural beast of the Wyld, or with any commoner Raksha whose Essence is less than half of the character's own, she can activate this power. When the Raksha asserts her authority over a valid target such as those just described, make a Willpower roll for the targeted creature with an internal penalty equal to the total number of mutation points the creature possesses. If the roll garners no successes, the creature will be compelled to obey the Raksha in all things for one season or until the Raksha terminates her Assumption, whichever comes first.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot compel obedience from any mutated Creation-born (including Wyld barbarians and mutants) whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Charisma. Furthermore, all Exalted are completely immune to this Charm, as are all Creation-born Essence-wielders of any sort.</description>

        <description>The gifts of Nirvikalpa disrupt communication as well as facilitate it, poisoning relationships and spreading mistrust with ease. When used in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, Prince and Pauper Approach confers upon the Raksha the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m; Speed: One long tick): The Raksha must interact with her target socially for a brief time before spending five motes of Essence. This power lets the Raksha pollute the target's aura with the scent of lies and misdirection. As a result, people who interact with the target will be less inclined to trust him and more suspicious of his motives. For the next season (or until the Raksha terminates her Assumption), the target's player suffers a -2 external penalty on all social rolls based on persuasion, as well as all rolls to make use of influence-related Backgrounds such as Backing, Contacts or Influence. Additionally, whenever the target's truthfulness is called into question, any attempt to discern whether he is lying suffers a -2 external penalty on Investigation rolls if the target is telling the truth (thereby making it more likely he will be disbelieved) and gain two automatic successes on Investigation rolls if the target is lying (to make it more likely that the deception is uncovered).
   Glamour Resistance: This power is a work of glamour. It cannot affect targets whose (Socialize + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation, nor can it affect Creation-born investigating the target whose (Investigation + Essence) exceed the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

She rolls (Charisma + Socialize) as a Staff-shaping attack against a difficulty equal to the target’s Essence; this roll may be enhanced by Charms that improve Staff-shaping attacks. If successful, for the next story, those who interact with the target will be less inclined to trust him and more suspicious of his motives. This is an Emotion effect that those who meet the target may ignored for one scene by spending a point of Willpower. All of the target's social attacks directed at those who find him untrustworthy suffer a -2 external penalty, and he is likely to fall under suspicion for any misdeeds that occur while he is in the area.

        <description>In the Wyld, the Raksha understands that words such as "truth" and "lie" are irrelevancies. The only real truths are those lies proven true by the intensity of one's belief in them. This Charm permits a Raksha to incorporate an indisputable truth into a shaping attack. The Raksha's player spends five motes and one Willpower and then rolls (Manipulation + Socialize) as a Staff-shaping attack. This Charm allows the Raksha to convert all post-soak damage dice into automatic successes. Additionally, a Raksha who spends three gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm gains the benefit of the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m, 1wp; Speed: 4 long ticks): The Raksha's player must roll (Manipulation + Presence) against a targeted Creation-born's MDV. Although this aspect of the power is not a shaping action, it can benefit from appropriate Charms that improve Staff-shaping rolls. If the roll succeeds, it triggers a Compulsion effect in the Creation-born. The Raksha can utter a single statement to the Creation-born, who is then compelled to believe it, no matter how absurd or improbable the statement is. A mortal told that she was blind would lose her sight. An Exalt told that his powers had been stripped away would be unable to use his Charms or other magical abilities. The Charm cannot allow people to do the impossible, but it will cause them to rationalize away their inability to do the impos-sible. If the Raksha tells a mortal he can fly, the mortal will not suddenly take to the air, but he would become alarmed at his inability to do so, and he might also be amenable to suggestions to "jump off that cliff to get more lift". Resisting this unnatural mental influence costs five Willpower, all of which must be paid at once.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power conferred by this Charm is a work of glamour that cannot persuade Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Manipulation.</description>

        <description>The gates of Nirvikalpa open wide, and the Raksha pours gossamer into Creation to demonstrate the infinite possibility of the Wyld. Or at least she appears to do so as far as weak-willed mortals can tell. This Charm allows the Raksha to perform "quick-and-dirty" shaping effects in Creation, fashioning Essence and gossamer into weak simulacra of the sorts of items she could fashion perfectly in the Wyld.
   Mechanically, this Charm superficially duplicates the effects of several Wyld-Based Crafting Charms. When creating living creatures, this Charm uses the rules for Shape-Forged Servant (see p. 200). When forging gossamer objects, it uses the rules for Gossamer-Forging Art (see p. 194). When enchanting territories or objects, it uses the rules for Translucent Dream Sheathing Technology (see pp. 198-199). When fashioning transport vehicles, it uses Unreal Shipwright's Method (see pp. 195-196).
   The Essence requirement for this Charm is always five motes, and this Essence is committed for the duration of the Charm. The gossamer requirement is calculated according to the Charm being mimicked but is always at least one gossamer. Despite their similarities, Veil of Glamour is generally inferior to each of the aforementioned Charms and differs from them in several important ways, some good and some bad.
   Most notably, the creation of a work of glamour through this Charm is instant, but the item or being that is forged automatically vanishes at the end of the Charm's duration. This duration is determined by what "seed", if any, is used as a basis for the glamour. For example, the seed of a minion might be an insect or a simple animal, while the seed of a Wyld vessel might be a pumpkin or a leaky old boat.
   In general, each item forged with this Charm must have as its seed a mundane item of Creation, in which case the Charm lasts for one scene per success on the player's (Intelligence + Craft [Glamour]) roll. This roll is considered a Ring- or Staff-shaping roll for purposes of Charms that can improve shaping rolls, but with a good stunt, a Raksha might be able to treat the roll as a Cup- or Sword-shaping action instead. The Raksha can add the Accuracy of any appropriate, Storyteller-sanctioned shaping weapon to the roll.
   If the Raksha uses a particularly appropriate seed, as determined by the Storyteller, the glamour lasts for one day per success. On the other hand, if the Raksha totally forgoes the use of a seed and crafts the item from nothingness, the result lasts for one action per success.
   Glamour Resistance: Items created through this Charm are works of glamour that have no effect on creatures whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Intelligence. Items created through Veil of Glamour can never be made into permanent works of glamour.</description>

        <description>The Raksha can craft a work of glamour that exists only within the mind of a consenting Creation-born target. Any Raksha who knows this Charm gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): This power duplicates the basic effects of Veil of Glamour except that the Essence spent on the Charm is not committed and the work of glamour can interact with only a single target. The glamour is not only unreal but imperceptible to Creation-born other than the target, but it is absolutely real to an affected target. Although this Charm has a gossamer cost of 0, the Raksha is treated as having spent up to his Essence in gossamer for purposes of determining whether the requirements of any of the other shaping Charms being mimicked have been met.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot affect a Creation-born whose (Perception + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Intelligence. The glamour cannot even be perceived by Creation-born other than the one who is the target of this Charm absent effects such as All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.

        <description>With this Charm, the Raksha assumes the persona of the Laughing Monster, a figure of derisive humor and unbridled chaos. For the duration of the battle, whenever the Raksha evades a shaping attack with any Shaping DV, the Raksha can spend one Willpower to redirect the shaping attack against any other target she wishes, including back against the original attacker. The attacker must reroll the attack against the new target, adding any bonus dice applied to the previous roll from Charms or stunts and treating the new target as if it had been the target all along.
   This is a Stance-type Charm. A character cannot use more than one Stance-type Charm at a time, and activating a new stance terminates the previous one. Any redirected attack occurs on Step 9 of combat resolution and is in addition to any counterattacks the Raksha can make.</description>

   Waking: The raksha infuses her body with the Essence of the dweller in the between, the laughing monster that twists oaths and intentions against their holders. This Charm functions as its Dreaming counterpart, save that the raksha may spend one gossamer and one willpower to redirect physical attacks she has successfully defended against with her DVs.</errText>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.

This Charm inflicts an unnatural Illusion on any pairs of characters within (Essence x 20) yards of the raksha who have mutual negative Intimacies toward one another, causing them to believe the object of their Intimacy has just uttered a deadly insult toward them. Some raksha use this Charm to map unfamiliar social environments in which they find themselves; others find it an amusing way to pass a slow afternoon.

        <description>Never Predictable, let alone boring, the Laughing Monster always strikes in a manner that defies expectation. The Raksha's player rolls (Charisma + Occult) as a Staff-shaping attack. A successful attack inflicts no new damage. Instead, the Raksha can heal up to (her Essence + the extra successes on the attack roll) levels of damage already inflicted on the target's Cup, Ring and/or Sword damage, dividing up the healing as she wishes. Then, she immediately and automatically inflicts as much damage as she healed on the target's Staff Grace. The Raksha can use this power to "heal" an ally (assuming his Staff Grace can survive the damage the Charm inflicts) or to cripple the Staff Grace of her enemy.</description>

        <description>Even armies slow their advance when baffled, distracted or humiliated by the Laughing Monster. At the beginning of shaping combat, the Raksha can invoke this Charm against one opponent per mote spent, up to a maximum number of targets equal to her Essence. The Raksha's player must roll (Intelligence + Occult) as a Staff-shaping attack, with the result compared to the Staff DV of each targeted enemy. If the attack succeeds against a character, that character suffers an internal penalty to his Join Shaping Battle roll equal to the Raksha's Essence. If this penalty reduces a character's Join Shaping Battle roll to 0 or below (before the application of any dice-adding effects or other Charms), that character will be unable to make any shaping attacks for (the Laughing Monster's Essence + 6) ticks. An affected character can still take reflexive actions and defend with reflexive Charms and effects.</description>

        <description>The Laughing Monster's intentions cannot be divined. Even when he openly tells his adversaries what he plans to do, few have the wit to see through the misdirection. This Charm renders a Staff-shaping attack of any sort unblockable and undodgeable, rendering all forms of Shaping DV inapplicable unless the target incorporates a Charm into her defense. Regardless of whether the target's DV applies, the Raksha also doubles extra successes for purposes of determining shaping damage.</description>

It costs one point of Willpower for the observer to see through this unnatural mental influence and realize that he has no true idea what the raksha is after.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm may only be incorporated into inward-facing dreams.</errText>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.
   The styles that follow are those most commonly known and understood.</description>

            <description>The Laughing Monster is a demonic child ruled by impetuosity and wicked humor, a merry prankster who takes inordinate joy in the humiliation of his rivals. Associated with Staff-shaping combat, the Laughing Monster mocks the idea of society, and those Diplomats who follow this path abandon all pretense of diplomatic solutions. A Raksha who plays the part of the Laughing Monster must never channel her Conviction during a shaping combat, or else, she will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the role of the Laughing Monster must adopt the persona of a childish and rude trickster. She must seize any and every opportunity to undermine established systems of authority and subvert acceptable notions of conduct. If the Laughing Monster ever declines the chance to embarrass or mock either a figure of authority or a sworn enemy, all costs associated with any of this style's Charms double for the duration of her current tale.</description>

        <description>Before the Laughing Monster's trickery, alliances fail and bonds of friendship shatter. The Raksha can use this Charm to sow division between two opponents and disrupt their alliance. The Raksha must identify two targets, and his player rolls (Charisma + Occult) as a Staff-shaping action against one of them. The difficulty of this roll is that target's Shaping DV or her Essence, whichever is higher. If the shaping attack is successful, then in addition to any other effect, the affected target suffers when in the presence of the other target. On each of her next five actions, if the affected target is in the same or an adjacent waypoint as her ally, she suffers one level of unavoidable and unsoakable Staff damage.</description>

Once the Raksha activates this Charm and until his next action, each time someone targets her with a shaping attack and misses, the Raksha can reflexively redirect the incoming shaping attack against any available target of her choice, including the original attacker.

   Waking: Having finished his tale, the raksha flashes a devilish smile and leaps into the air, before the astonished eyes of his foes. This Charm may only be activated inside of a building; it deposits the raksha outside of the structure, just beyond the closest exit. Note that this Charm will never kill or injure the raksha for using it - if the nearest exit is an open window on the seventh floor of a tower, she will appear outside of the front door on the bottom floor. If she is inside of a castle surrounded by a moat full of sharpened stakes and all of the drawbridges are up, she will appear just on the other side of the moat. The Charm does not account for any guards or other angry men with swords she might suddenly appear in front of; having liberated her, the narrative of the Laughing Monster leaves the rest of the raksha's escape up to her own cleverness.

        <description>Some Raksha (far too many as far as Creation is concerned) have monsters lurking in their souls. A Raksha with this Charm can unleash that monster during her darkest moments. The Raksha can activate this Charm in the Wyld at any point before he enters bedlam, thereby gaining the benefits of the listed innate power for the duration of the tale. Alternatively, he can spend one gossamer to activate this Charm in conjunction with an Assumption to gain the following innate power for the Assumption's duration:
   Innate Power (Cost: 10m): When a Raksha enters bedlam, he can reflexively spend 10 motes to instantly gain a number of temporary mutation points equal to half his permanent Willpower. These mutations last as long as the Raksha stays in bedlam and have no adverse effect on him, even if the sum of his (mutation points + Essence) exceeds her (Willpower + 4). The player must choose the mutations that will be acquired during bedlam when this Charm is first purchased. These mutations are fixed until the Raksha's permanent Willpower increases or decreases, at which time the player can reallocate them as he wishes.</description>

        <description>The Raksha strikes like lightning, snatching his prize out of his startled enemy's hands. Upon activating this Charm, the Raksha names one of the target's possessions and makes a Sword- or Staff-shaping attack at +2 difficulty. If the attack succeeds, the Raksha automatically asserts a claim on the named object, which instantly passes into his possession. This effect is in addition to the attack's normal damage. This Charm cannot be used to steal Graces, artifacts or hearthstones, but it can be used to steal a shaping weapon, even a readied one, which does not fit into one of those categories.
   In addition, a Raksha who knows this Charm gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m, 1wp; Speed: 3) The Raksha becomes a preternaturally skilled pickpocket or thief in Creation. When attempting to acquire an inanimate object currently in the possession of a Creation-born (whether a bag of gold, a sword or the Creation-born's pants), the attempt automatically succeeds unless the target of the theft has Essence 2 or higher. If the target does have Essence 2 or higher, the Raksha instead adds automatic successes to his Larceny or Stealth rolls equal to his Sword Grace. Furthermore, neither the victim nor any potential witnesses who fail to detect the theft will be capable of noticing the loss for a number of scenes equal to the Raksha's Essence. (This protection fails if circumstances call attention to the theft, such as if the victim goes to pay for his meal and finds he has no gold, he enters battle and finds he has no sword, or he walks out into the street half-naked to the jeers of the crowd). This Charm cannot be used to steal a magical item whose owner is attuned to it.
   Glamour Resistance: This Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect Creation-born whose (Perception + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's Dexterity.</description>

            <errText>Waking: The raksha becomes a preternaturally skilled pickpocket or thief in Creation. When attempting to acquire an inanimate object currently in the possession of a Creation-born (whether a bag of silver, a sword or the Creation-born's pants), the attempt automatically succeeds unless the target of the theft has Essence 2 or higher. If the target does have Essence 2+, the raksha instead adds a number of automatic successes to the Larceny attempt equal to his Sword Grace. This Charm cannot be used to steal weapons or armor being actively used by their owners, though objects currently in use are otherwise fair game. The occlusion of the theft is an unnatural Illusion costing two Willpower to see through, or one Willpower if characters have sudden and pressing reason to recognize the theft (such as attempting to pay for dinner with money that has just been stolen).</errText>

        <description>Sometimes even the sharpest blade must yield to the power of a well-timed bribe. The Raksha can negate all the damage inflicted by a single Sword-shaping attack by sacrificing gossamer. For each point of gossamer expended, two damage successes are negated, with fractional gossamer lost. The sacrificed gossamer instantly becomes a possession of the attacker.</description>

Canny Fair Folk know that it is better to give away part of one's being than to cease to be entirely. This Charm may be activated when the raksha would mark off her Incapacitated health box with lethal or aggravated damage. The box is not marked off; instead, the individual who struck the killing blow against the raksha instantly gains possession of one of the raksha's Graces (of the raksha's choice), in the hopes that this bribe will mollify the attacker's wrath. This Charm may be used no more than once per scene, and may not be activated if the character's Incapacitated health box is marked off by cold iron, or if the raksha is slain by some natural happenstance of the world, such as by falling off of a cliff or being immolated in a forest fire; the callous world the Primordials built disdains faerie bribes.</errText>

This Charm supplements a physical or Sword-shaping attack. If successful, the victim contracts a dream-poison which takes effect when she next sleeps. Rather than regaining a point of Willpower for each success on her Conviction roll, she instead suffers one level of lethal damage per success. Multiple doses of this poison stack to produce lethal nightmares across consecutive nights.
   Oneirmantic benefit: Incorporated into an outward-facing glamour, the spell makes one Sword-shaping attack per scene (even in Creation) against characters within its range of effect who take a specific pre-decided action.</errText>

When there is no hope to be found, when the raksha's armies are encircled, her mind befuddled, her corpse riddled with arrows - this is the hour of her greatest triumph, when she shatters the chains of the grave and rises to fight anew. This Charm may be activated when the raksha is contesting control of an entanglement, allowing her to automatically escape without harm to herself or her opponent. She may also reflexively pay one mote at any time to shape herself back from narrative death without needing to use up a shaping action to override the inconvenience of her demise.

Thus, canny raksha may avert an untimely demise through a clever work of glamour. The raksha may reflexively spend five gossamer at any time to convert all of the lethal damage she has suffered into bashing damage - even if she is unconscious at the time. If she is Incapacitated, this also causes her to appear to be dead, an unnatural Illusion that costs three points of Willpower to see through. This trick may only be called upon a maximum of once per fortnight.</errText>

        <description>This Charm permits the Raksha to summon into existence, whether within the Wyld or in Creation, a monster or a small army of extras to fight on her behalf. In the Wyld, it allows the Raksha to create a Sword-shaping weapon out of Essence and glamour. The monster is a lumbering beast with a Speed of 5. The Raksha's player can divide (the Raksha's Sword Grace x 2) among the monster's Accuracy, Defense and lethal damage. The army is a unit of about 500 extras that moves quickly but without the monster's raw, overbearing power. The army has a Speed of 3, but the Raksha's player can divide only the Raksha's Sword Grace among the army-weapon's Accuracy, Defense and lethal damage. In either case, the weapon has a rate equal to the Raksha's Willpower. The shaping weapon lasts for a single shaping battle.
   In Creation, any monster summoned into existence by this Charm is usually a behemoth or a fey beast built with a number of mutation points equal to twice the Raksha's Sword Grace. An army created by this Charm uses the traits for elite troops with a Magnitude equal to the Raksha's Sword Grace. The monster or army endures for one scene in Creation.
   Glamour Resistance: A monster or army fashioned through this Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot attack, defend against or soak attacks from any Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's War. The army cannot engage in mass combat against units whose (Drill + Might) exceeds the Raksha's War.</description>

The Raksha's player can divide (the Raksha's Sword Grace x 2) among the monster's Accuracy, Defense and lethal damage. The army is a unit of about 500 extras that moves quickly but without the monster's raw, overbearing power. The army has a Speed of 3, but the Raksha's player can divide only the Raksha's Sword Grace among the army-weapon's Accuracy, Defense and lethal damage. In either case, the weapon has a rate equal to the Raksha's Willpower. The shaping weapon lasts for a single shaping battle.
   In Creation, any monster summoned into existence by this Charm is usually a behemoth or a fey beast built with a number of mutation points equal to twice the Raksha's Sword Grace. An army created by this Charm uses the traits for elite troops with a Magnitude equal to the Raksha's Sword Grace. The monster or army endures for one scene in Creation.
   Glamour Resistance: A monster or army fashioned through this Charm is a work of glamour. It cannot attack, defend against or soak attacks from any Creation-born whose (Wits + Essence) exceeds the Raksha's War. The army cannot engage in mass combat against units whose (Drill + Might) exceeds the Raksha's War.</description>
            <errText>Waking: This Charm permits the raksha to summon a monster or army into existence in Creation or in the Wyld. The monster has the traits of a mundane animal of the raksha's choice (superpredators such as tyrant lizards and river dragons tend to be preferred, but sometimes a raksha simply needs a reliable mount such as a horse or austrech with which to show off in style), plus a number of mutation points equal to the raksha's (Sword x 2). The army is Magnitude 3, with the traits of elite soldiers and Drill equal to the raksha's Sword. Both monsters and armies are perfectly loyal to the raksha, are fully real to the Creation-born, and are not suitable for use as shaping weapons. They vanish at the end of the scene. This Charm may not be reactivated to replenish members of a defeated army during the scene.</errText>

        <description>Such is the power of the Sword that all who are wise seek to stay out of its reach. This Charm lets the Raksha prevent his opponent from entering the same waypoint in which he stands. Whenever an opponent seeks to enter a waypoint the Raksha occupies or controls, the Raksha's player rolls (Dexterity + Melee) as an undodgeable Sword-shaping attack. If this attack overcomes the opponent's Shaping DV, the opponent cannot enter the waypoint for a number of actions equal to the Raksha's Sword.
   In addition, the Raksha who knows this Charm gains access to the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m, 1wp): The Raksha assumes a defensive posture that Creation-born fear to challenge. The Raksha's player rolls (Dexterity + Melee) or (Dexterity + Martial Arts). For the rest of the scene, any Creation-born character whose Valor does not exceed the Raksha's successes is unable to approach the Raksha closely enough to engage her in close combat. The Creation-born can still make ranged attacks, and he can overcome the effect to make Martial Arts or Melee attacks by spending one Willpower per attack. When the Creation-born has spent three Willpower, the effect is overcome completely. The Raksha can advance toward affected characters and force them to back away, but the effect ends if she either backs the characters into a corner or engages in any hostile action against them.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power aspect of this Charm is a work of glamour that cannot affect characters whose (Valor + Essence) exceed the Raksha's Dexterity.</description>

In order to use this Charm, the Raksha must first successfully defend against a Sword-shaping attack with his Sword Shaping DV.

        <description>The Raksha adopts a terrifying appearance that unnerves and frightens his enemies. When the Raksha is in the Wyld, his player must spend five motes and one Willpower and make a successful Sword-shaping attack against an enemy. If the attack succeeds, that enemy suffers an internal penalty on all Sword- and Staff-shaping attacks against the Raksha for the rest of the scene equal to the Raksha's Sword. In addition, a Raksha who knows this Charm can spend two gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm to gain the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m, 1wp): Once this power is activated, any Creation-born who interacts with the Raksha suffers an internal penalty equal to the Raksha's Sword on all dice pools due to fear for the duration of the scene.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power is a work of glamour that does not affect Creation-born whose (Valor + Essence) exceeds the highest of the Raksha's Sword Abilities.</description>

   Waking: Those who have lost part of their souls to the raksha's hunger remember her in their nightmares for the rest of their lives. Any character who has ever had one of his traits permanently reduced by the raksha through the use of a feeding Charm such as Ravishing the Created Form or Soul-Consuming Hunger suffers a permanent internal penalty equal to the raksha's Sword on all rolls directed against the raksha in any sort of hostile capacity - attacks, social attacks aimed at anything but begging for mercy, attempts to pick the raksha's pockets, and so on. This unnatural fear effect costs one Willpower to ignore for a scene, but can never be permanently overcome so long as the raksha lives.</errText>

        <description>When a Raksha carrying this mutation takes multiple actions (including flurries), the first five actions undertaken suffer no multiple-action penalties at all. Beginning with the sixth action, all normal penalties apply. Therefore, in a seven-attack flurry, the first five actions suffer no multiple action penalties, but the sixth will suffer a 12-die penalty and the seventh a 13-die penalty. The benefits of this mutation stack with those of Millipede Mind and Hundred-Hand Style, and any or all of these Charms can be activated simultaneously without the need for a Combo.</description>

These Charms are specifically designed to permit a Raksha who already has an active Assumption Charm to add them to her form with a standard Sword-shaping action and without dismissing and then reactivating the Assumption. Most Charms carrying the Mutation keyword can confer mutation benefits only if they are activated in the Wyld in conjunction with an Assumption Charm. If one of these Charms is activated in conjunction with an Assumption Charm, the Raksha need only pay the associated gossamer cost. Unless stated otherwise, none of the benefits acquired through these Charms provoke Glamour Resistance among Creation-born.</description>

        <description>The Raksha embeds one of his Graces into a consenting commoner Raksha, conveying certain benefits. First, the commoner Raksha gains the characteristics of a heroic commoner if she wasn't one already. Second, the commoner Raksha becomes utterly loyal to the one who embedded the Grace and at all times knows his will and obeys it completely. Third, both the Raksha who embedded the Grace and the commoner in whom it was embedded have access to this Grace and can use it independently for satisfying Charm minimum requirements and for establishing the character's damage track for that Grace. The Raksha who used this Charm can reclaim his Grace at any time but must be in the physical presence of the commoner Raksha to do so. If the commoner Raksha is slain (permanently or not), the Charm ends immediately, and the commoner's slayer may take possession of the Grace. Otherwise, the Charm is effectively permanent.</description>

        <description>This mutation allows the Raksha to stretch her limbs at will up to two yards for every point of gossamer spent in the activation of this Charm. The Raksha cannot spend more gossamer in activating this Charm than her Essence. A Raksha who has this Charm active at any level applies the Reach tag to all attacks (see Exalted, p. 373). Also, for every two yards by which the Raksha's legs are extended, add two to her Move and Dash rates.</description>

        <description>This mutation grants the Raksha a set of fully functional wings shaped from the mixed materials of both Wyld and Creation. Usually, nobles build their wings from one of the elements while commoners build theirs to resemble those of insects or birds. Typically, a Raksha's wingspan is at least as wide as the Raksha is tall, and the Raksha must be able to spread and flap his wings to fly. The Raksha's regular flight speed is equal to his normal Move or Dash rate. He ascends at half that rate and can dive at twice it.
   Gossamer wings are clumsy, inflicting a -2 internal penalty on all Dexterity-based normal actions while airborne. If the Raksha's player either purchases this Charm a second time or spends twice the normal activation cost, this penalty is negated.
   Note: The Wings abomination confers wings that are far more effective than gossamer wings, but are much more expensive in terms of Essence (15m) and gossamer (6g).</description>

            <description>This Charm permanently grants the raksha some means of flight equivalent to the wings mutation. Commoners generally grow literal wings, while nobles generally fly through some means appropriate to their Assumption. A raksha using the Assumption of Fire Shape might soar through the air on wings of flame, while one using Assumption of Cerements and Bone might be carried aloft on a susurrus of prayer. If the raksha has the wings mutation, her flight speed doubles.
   Oneiromantic benefit: This Charm only be incorporated into inward-facing dreams.</description>

        <description>Unusually for a Wyld mutation, this mutation makes the Raksha seem... normal. The Raksha's body language and expressive techniques seem both human and familiar, reminding those Creation-born who encounter him of old acquaintances. This mutation grants two automatic successes on all mundane social rolls against the Creation-born. Even if the Raksha is hideous, the mutation still encourages Creation-born to notice her "inner beauty". This Charm does not provoke Glamour Resistance. Despite its benefits, it does not affect Creation-born directly but simply enables the Raksha to better interact with them.</description>

        <description>The Fair Folk are puzzled by the fearful tenacity with which humans cling to the shape in which they are born. Creation offers such a wide variety of morphological oddities - wings and claws and stingers, fur and scales and leaves in hundreds of interesting colors, and more besides. Why not indulge? The raksha gains six points worth of mutations each time he purchases this Charm. A pox is worth one point, an affliction worth two, a blight four and an abomination six. At any time the raksha may summon one of the mutations he has learned with this Charm and adorn his body with it. This costs one gossamer for a pox, two for an affliction, three for a blight and four for an abomination. The raksha may dismiss these mutations at any time for no cost. These mutations automatically dismiss themselves if the raksha at any point finds himself without an active Assumption.</description>

        <description>The Raksha can incorporate some type of natural weaponry into his form - fangs, claws, horns, a forked tongue, a stinging tail, etc. - that he can use to supplement an unarmed Martial Arts attack. When the player chooses the weapon, he divides the Raksha's Essence up among the weapon's Accuracy, Defense, Damage (which is lethal) and Rate. As the Raksha's Essence improves, he may continue to improve his natural weapon's traits. The weapon's Speed is always 5. Players can purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the Raksha's Sword. Each time the player takes this Charm, he can add an additional weapon or add his Essence again to improve the quality of an existing one.</description>

        <description>Standing at the threshold between reality and possibility, the Raksha carves a mutation in the form of supernal skill into her nature. This mutation grants the Raksha a two-die specialty to the Ability of her player's choice. This mutation-specialty does not count against the normal three-die cap on specialties. A Raksha can purchase a normal three-die specialty and then purchase this mutation to raise the total specialty bonus to +5. Players can purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the Raksha's Sword, but any particular Ability can benefit from this Charm only once.</description>

        <description>Placing his own body in the crucible of possibility, the Raksha transcends the limits of his own perfection. This mutation permanently increases the Raksha's Attributes in one of the following ways each time it is purchased:

• The Raksha gains one dot of Intelligence and one dot of Perception.
• The Raksha gains one dot of Charisma and one dot of Appearance.
• The Raksha gains one dot of Dexterity.
• The Raksha gains one dot of Wits.
• The Raksha gains one dot of Manipulation.
   Players can purchase this mutation up to once per dot of the Raksha's Sword. Each time an Attribute rating increases as a result of this Charm, the character's maximum rating in that Attribute also increases by one.</description>

            <name>Shaping Stances</name>
            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.
   The styles that follow are those most commonly known and understood.</description>

            <name>World-Devouring Warlord Style</name>
            <description>The World-Devouring Warlord is an irresistible conquering force whose destiny is to rule all that she surveys. Associated with Sword-shaping combat, the World-Devouring Warlord teaches Warriors to comport themselves as generals and rulers instead of mere combatants. It is the duty of the Warlord's army or champion to fight on her behalf, and it is unfitting for a true Warlord to bloody herself in a meaningless frontline skirmish when there is a conquest to direct. Accordingly, a Raksha who plays the part of the World-Devouring Warlord must never channel her Valor during a shaping combat, or else she will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the World-Devouring Warlord must adopt the posture of one who is destined to rule over all, a posture that snide inferiors might call megalomania, though never to the Warlord's face if they are wise. The Warlord must never show deference to any other being, no matter how great his power. If she ever does so, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of her current tale.</description>

        <description>The start of any tale of war begins with the initiation of hostilities, and every Warlord's story must begin with his motivation for battle. This Charm allows the Raksha to defend against aggressive shaping attacks by defining the circumstances under which conflict can begin. By spending one mote, the Raksha adds a bonus equal to half his Sword (rounded up) to his applicable Shaping DV.</description>

        <description>The Warlord must have his enemy - they cannot exist without one another. This Charm permits the Raksha to define both himself and a particular antagonist (who must exist and must currently hold an antagonistic posture toward him) as the principal characters in the Raksha's narrative. While the Charm continues to function, it automatically negates all shaping effects that would otherwise remove either the Raksha or his named antagonist as active characters in the story. No one can shape the Raksha into quiescence, banishment or death without also in some manner restoring him to life and/or activity.</description>

            <description>The World-Devouring Warlord is an irresistible conquering force whose destiny is to rule all that she surveys. Associated with Sword-shaping combat, the World-Devouring Warlord teaches Warriors to comport themselves as generals and rulers instead of mere combatants. It is the duty of the Warlord's army or champion to fight on her behalf, and it is unfitting for a true Warlord to bloody herself in a meaningless frontline skirmish when there is a conquest to direct. Accordingly, a Raksha who plays the part of the World-Devouring Warlord must never channel her Valor during a shaping combat, or else she will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the World-Devouring Warlord must adopt the posture of one who is destined to rule over all, a posture that snide inferiors might call megalomania, though never to the Warlord's face if they are wise. The Warlord must never show deference to any other being, no matter how great his power. If she ever does so, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of her current tale.</description>

        <description>The Warlord becomes an avatar of the Sword, a living incarnation of idea of battle. In this form, he can devour the world if he so desires. While this stance is active, the Raksha's player adds the character's permanent Essence to her Join Shaping Battle roll in the Wyld, to her Sword-shaping attack pools and to her Sword damage. She also adds half her Sword (rounded up) to her Sword-shaping DV. She also gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 6m): The Raksha's player may reflexively add the Raksha's permanent Essence in automatic successes to her Join Battle roll.
   This is a Stance-type Charm. A character cannot use more than one Stance-type Charm at a time, and activating a new stance terminates the previous one. The innate power granted by this Charm affects only the Raksha herself and does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.
   The styles that follow are those most commonly known and understood.</description>

        <description>The armies of the Warlord are without number. Nations tremble at their every footstep. The Raksha summons servants and minions from the Wyld to bolster his ranks. These summoned troops are gossamer extras that never interact with enemies directly but swell the Raksha's forces ominously. In the Wyld, this Charm increases the Defense bonus of the Raksha's Sword-shaping weapon by one. This Charm can be activated up to a number of times equal to the Raksha's Sword, and subsequent invocations are cumulative. Additionally, a Raksha who knows this Charm gains the following innate power in Creation:
   Innate Power (Cost: 3m; Speed: One long tick): The Raksha can fashion illusions of additional troops to make his forces look bigger, more impressive and, as a result, more confident. In the context of mass combat, this Charm adds one to the Morale of the Raksha's forces for purposes of resisting rout or hesitation. It also inflicts a -1 penalty on Morale rolls for opposing forces to resist rout or hesitation.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power associated with this Charm is a work of glamour. The bonus to the Morale of the Raksha's forces always applies, but the penalty applied to the Morale rolls of opposing Creation-born forces does not apply if the (Drill + Might) of that unit exceeds the Raksha's War.</description>

This Charm allows the Raksha to summon monsters, horrors, war machines and other grotesqueries of the Wyld to bolster her forces.

In the Wyld, each application of this Charm increases the Damage rating of her Sword-shaping weapon by one, and multiple applications of the Charm are cumulative. In Creation, this Charm confers the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m, Speed: Three long ticks): The Raksha summons forth illusions of powerful and terrifying magical creatures to harry opposing forces. In the context of mass combat, this Charm adds one to the Might of the Raksha's forces for all purposes against affected units.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power associated with this Charm is a work of glamour that does not affect an opposing Creation-born unit if the (Drill + Might) of that unit exceeds the Raksha's War.</description>

            <description>A shaping stance is the heart of a cascade of related shaping Charms developed by the raksha to facilitate their narrative magic. From the perspective of the Fair Folk, each stance germinates a story that the raksha tells through his life and actions. As long as the raksha maintains the characteristics and tropes of the persona he adopts, he gains preternatural skill at manipulating the Wyld in accordance with the persona's idiom. Sidereal savants who have studied the shaping stances theorize that they, in many ways, give rise to the shaping combat equivalent of martial arts styles. Each such style serves to conceptualize a particular approach to shaping combat, and each also resembles martial arts styles from a conceptual framework.
   The Charms associated with a stance start out small before the adherent is sufficiently enlightened in the ways of the Wyld to master a persistent stance after which the entire style is named (in the same way that each martial arts style is named after its Form-type Charm). Even the wisest savants among the Sidereals and Lunars have no idea how many stances exist or whether any are more powerful and frightening than those commonly known. Some of the more paranoid Sidereals wonder if the Fair Folk have a stance-based equivalent to Sidereal Martial Arts.
   The styles that follow are those most commonly known and understood.</description>

            <name>World-Devouring Warlord Style</name>
            <description>The World-Devouring Warlord is an irresistible conquering force whose destiny is to rule all that she surveys. Associated with Sword-shaping combat, the World-Devouring Warlord teaches Warriors to comport themselves as generals and rulers instead of mere combatants. It is the duty of the Warlord's army or champion to fight on her behalf, and it is unfitting for a true Warlord to bloody herself in a meaningless frontline skirmish when there is a conquest to direct. Accordingly, a Raksha who plays the part of the World-Devouring Warlord must never channel her Valor during a shaping combat, or else she will be unable to use any of the Charms of this style for the duration of that combat, and all persistent Charms already activated will end immediately. Additionally, a Raksha who plays the part of the World-Devouring Warlord must adopt the posture of one who is destined to rule over all, a posture that snide inferiors might call megalomania, though never to the Warlord's face if they are wise. The Warlord must never show deference to any other being, no matter how great his power. If she ever does so, any costs associated with the Charms of this style double for the duration of her current tale.</description>

        <description>The Warlord has mastered the very idea of War. The battlefield knows its mistress and lends aid and comfort to her forces while thwarting the moves of enemy forces, whether through bad weather, hostile terrain or worse effects. Each use of this Charm in conjunction with a Sword-shaping roll reduces the target's Sword DV by one for the duration of the battle, regardless of whether the Sword-shaping attack actually succeeds. The Raksha can invoke this Charm multiple times, but the maximum DV penalty she can inflict is equal to her Essence. Also, while in Creation, a Raksha who knows this Charm gains the following innate power:
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha casts illusions to alter the terrain of the battlefield, turning it against Creation-born units. In the context of mass combat, this Charm casts an illusion over a battlefield causing Creation-born units to perceive open terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as extreme terrain, with all the movement penalties such terrain inflicts (see Exalted, p. 163). At a Cost of 10 motes, the Raksha can cause Creation-born units to perceive open terrain as extreme terrain. The Raksha's own units never suffer the effects of this power.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power associated with this Charm is a work of glamour that does not affect an opposing Creation-born unit if the (Drill + Might) of that unit exceeds the Raksha's War.</description>

   Waking: The raksha englamours the terrain of the battlefield, turning it against Creation-born armies. Used when the raksha leads or is a special character in a complementary mass combat unit, this Charm causes all hostile units within (Sword) miles to treat open terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as extreme terrain, with all the movement penalties such terrain inflicts (see Exalted, p. 163). With Essence 4+ the Charm transforms open terrain into extreme terrain. The raksha's unit and those of his allies never suffer any penalties from this Charm.</errText>

        <description>For the true Warlord, victory is assured before the first blow is even struck. When the Raksha deploys this Charm in conjunction with a successful Sword-shaping attack, the Charm automatically converts all Sword damage dice into successes. In addition, a Raksha who knows this Charm and spends one additional point of gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption Charm gains the following innate power.
   Innate Power (Cost: 5m): The Raksha performs the Dance of the World-Devouring Warlord, a sinuous kata that can be performed bare-handed or with any type of weapon. This dance tells the tale of his inevitable victory, and his story reaches out across a battlefield to instill in the hearts of his enemies the certainty of their defeat. The player of a Raksha engaged in mass combat rolls (Dexterity + highest Sword Ability) against a difficulty equal to the Might of the opposing unit. Each threshold success reduces the Magnitude of the unit by 1, as affected mortals lay down their arms in hopeless surrender. If the Dance of the World-Devouring Warlord is used against a solo unit, the player makes the same roll against the target's Dodge MDV. If the roll succeeds, the target suffers a -5 internal penalty on all combat-related rolls for the remainder of the scene.
   Glamour Resistance: The innate power associated with this Charm is a work of glamour that does not affect opposing Creation-born units if the (Drill + Might) of that unit exceed Sword Ability used by the Raksha's player in the activation roll, nor can it affect any individual whose (Valor + Essence) exceeds that Sword Ability.</description>

This Charm maybe used to supplement an attack directed at a complementary mass combat unit when the raksha leads a complementary mass combat unit of his own.

        <description>Similar to Father's Commanding Voice, this Charm allows an Emanation to send a behemoth into other waypoints or even Creation, to see through its eyes and to command its movements and actions. At a cost of five motes and one Willpower, the Emanation can send a behemoth into any nearby waypoint either to act as a scout or to permit a Sword-shaping weapon against a raksha to be found there. In the latter case, the Emanation can use the behemoth to make a ranged Swordshaping attack. Each Sword-shaping attack made in this way costs two motes and one gossamer per attack.
   Additionally, if the Emanation adds two gossamer to the activation cost, the Emanation can send the behemoth into Creation. The Emanation can perceive through the behemoth's senses, and it will obey his commands. Each scene in which the behemoth attacks Creation-born or damages physical objects of Creation costs two motes and one gossamer. A behemoth sent into Creation through this Charm is treated as a permanent work of glamour (assuming it wasn't already) and does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>With Nirupadhika acting as her guide, no raksha need ever fear being lost again. By spending four motes, the raksha can instantly plot a perfect course to any location in the Wyld she has ever visited. Even if she knows nothing about the desired location except for its name, she can navigate to it with a successful Way-shaping action. The player rolls (Wits + Survival) for the raksha to find a location within a waypoint or (Wits + Sail) for her to locate a location one or more waypoints away. The raksha must know an actual name for the location. It is not enough to ask, "Where is Neshi of the Double Whips?" Instead, the raksha must be able to ask, "Where is the Tower of Singing Crystal?" If the location to be sought is shielded by Charms or other magic designed to obscure its location, the raksha's player must succeed at an appropriate roll with a difficulty equal to the Essence of the being who concealed the location or the number of successes obtained on any roll for concealment, whichever is higher.
   Any raksha who knows this Charm also gains the following innate power in Creation.
   Innate Power (Cost: 4m): This innate power duplicates the preceding effects in Creation. The raksha can reflexively plot a course for any location she has ever visited or plot a course with a dice roll to any location for which she knows the name. If the location is in the West, the raksha must roll (Wits + Sail). In any other direction, the roll is (Wits + Survival). This power affects only the raksha and does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>For Nirupadhika, location is merely a subset of identity, and "where one is" is a factor that helps define "who one is". By spending eight motes and one Willpower, the raksha can trail someone through the trackless wastes of the Wyld. The raksha must have met the quarry at least once or else hold one of her possessions, and he must begin tracking from some place he knows she has been. Then the raksha's player must roll (Wits + Survival) as a Way-shaping action. If the quarry to be sought is shielded by Charms or other magic designed to obscure her location, the raksha's player must make an appropriate roll with a difficulty equal to the Essence of the being who concealed the location or the number of successes obtained on any roll for concealment, whichever is higher.
   Any raksha who knows this Charm and spends one gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption also gains the following innate power in Creation.
   Innate Power (Cost: 8m, 1wp): When active, this power duplicates the effects of the Unshakeable Bloodhound Technique Charm (see Exalted, p. 211). This power affects only the raksha and does not provoke Glamour Resistance.</description>

        <description>Having learned to determine where he is, the raksha can now conceal that information from others. By spending five motes and one Willpower, the raksha can conceal his current location and movements from the use of either Perfect Reckoning Technique or Hound of Land and Seas, as well as other comparable magics. In the Wyld, a raksha who activates this Charm is invisible to all attempts to scry his current location or to track him from waypoint to waypoint. Against Charms or stunts, this power instead increases the difficulty of all rolls to scry or track the raksha by an amount equal to his (Way + Stealth).
   Also, any raksha who knows this Charm and spends one additional gossamer in conjunction with an Assumption also gains the following innate power in Creation.
   Innate Power (Cost: 8m, 1wp): When active, this power duplicates the effects of the Trackless Passage Charm (see Exalted, p. 211).
   Glamour Resistance: The benefits of this power automatically fail against Creation-born whose (Perception + Essence) exceeds the raksha's Stealth.</description>

        <description>Dreaming: As per Rejection of Desire, except that the raksha can perfectly parry a Way-shaping attack.
   Waking: The Fair Folk do not allow themselves to be encumbered by the world as they pass through it. The character may spend one gossamer to erase all of her memories of a specific journey or route. If she holds an Intimacy toward that journey or route, it is instantly erased. A token of the forgotten journey or route appears at the raksha's feet in a form related to travel - perhaps a map leading to nowhere, a sextant, or an old road-worn boot. Any character who falls asleep while touching the token dreams of the journey or route the raksha has chosen to forget. Should the raksha ever touch the token, it immediately vanishes, the lost memory is restored, and the raksha may never use Rejection of Direction to forget it again.</description>
