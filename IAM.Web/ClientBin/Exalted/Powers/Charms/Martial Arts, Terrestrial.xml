            <description>There is only one Terrestrial-level martial art of cially endorsed and taught by the Immaculate Order: Five-Dragon Style. Created by the same Immaculate masters who developed the Five Glorious Dragon Styles, Five-Dragon Style represents all the elemental aspects. It carries with it some of the power of each of the Elemental Dragons, though it dilutes the strength and religious import of each.
   One of the most favored styles among non-Immaculate Dynasts and on the Blessed Isle in general, monks and other Dragon-Blooded who walk the Fivefold Dragon Paths consider Five-Dragon Style something of a lesser cousin.
       Practitioners of Five-Dragon Style consider the straight sword and the spear, and their artifact equivalents (the daiklave and the dire lance), to be form weapons for their style. They can use these weapons to supplement their Martial Arts attacks in lieu of more traditional martial arts weapons. Five-Dragon Style Charms treat attacks and defenses with these weapons as unarmed, and the style is compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>With a brief invocation to the might of the Five Dragons, the Dragon-Blooded martial artist lays out his foe with a single attack.
   This attack doubles the normal base damage from an attack (which does not include extra successes) before subtracting soak. Also, if the attack generates more raw damage than the target's (Stamina + Resistance), the roll to avoid knockdown is made at a difficulty equal to the attacker's Strength.</description>

If she's wielding one of the form's weapons, she treats it as though it has +1 Accuracy. Also, she adds her Essence to her Dexterity or Strength for determining running speed, jumping distance and feats of strength.</description>

        <description>Calling upon the endless energies of the Elemental Dragons, the Exalt explodes into a furious assault. This rain of blows is the apex of the Five-Dragon Style and is immediately recognizable to any who have seen it in action before.
   For every mote spent, the Exalt makes one attack at his full attack dice pool. All attacks must be against the same target. He may not spend more motes on this Charm than his Essence, and the defender does not suffer any onslaught penalty. Using this Charm inflicts one level of unsoakable bashing damage on the Dragon-Blood.</description>

            <description>The techniques of the Terrestrial Hero Style are some of the easiest for Dragon-Blooded to learn. Sharing an aspect with the element of Water, there is no style that meshes more perfectly with the Water Aspects' blend of natural and relentless violence. For Dragon-Blooded, Terrestrial Hero Style is a natural style—they treat its Charms like normal Charms for the Martial Arts Ability, and they can learn or create additional Charms in its cascade. Blade-Deflecting Palm and Become the Hammer are examples of Martial Arts Charms that Dragon-Blooded can add to this style. Charms outside the structure of the normal Terrestrial Hero Style can be learned only by Dragon-Blooded, Eclipse Caste Solars and Moonshadow Caste Abyssals.
   This style is one of the most common among Dragon-Blooded throughout Creation, simply for the sheer utility of being able to create custom Charms for unarmed combat. It sees particular use among the Dragon-Blooded of the West, of course, but it is also taught in some schools on the Blessed Isle, in Lookshy and, surprisingly, in the hot South. Dragon-Blooded there sometimes prefer to emulate the element they find most rare and valuable.
   Terrestrial Hero Style is an unarmed style, but it may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>Even the most tranquil shores have hidden currents, flows beneath the surface that are just waiting to snatch an unsuspecting victim and send her down to the Water Dragon. Students of Terrestrial Hero Style learn early on how to emulate this highly effective technique with low, sweeping attacks.
   On a successful attack, the target takes no damage but automatically makes a check against knockdown, and she suffers an internal penalty equal to the attacker's Martial Arts rating. If the target is knocked down and the Exalt follows up with a clinch attack on his next action, the Exalt's player adds that many dice to his roll.</description>

            <description>The techniques of the Terrestrial Hero Style are some of the easiest for Dragon-Blooded to learn. Sharing an aspect with the element of Water, there is no style that meshes more perfectly with the Water Aspects' blend of natural and relentless violence. For Dragon-Blooded, Terrestrial Hero Style is a natural style—they treat its Charms like normal Charms for the Martial Arts Ability, and they can learn or create additional Charms in its cascade. Blade-Deflecting Palm and Become the Hammer are examples of Martial Arts Charms that Dragon-Blooded can add to this style. Charms outside the structure of the normal Terrestrial Hero Style can be learned only by Dragon-Blooded, Eclipse Caste Solars and Moonshadow Caste Abyssals.
   This style is one of the most common among Dragon-Blooded throughout Creation, simply for the sheer utility of being able to create custom Charms for unarmed combat. It sees particular use among the Dragon-Blooded of the West, of course, but it is also taught in some schools on the Blessed Isle, in Lookshy and, surprisingly, in the hot South. Dragon-Blooded there sometimes prefer to emulate the element they find most rare and valuable.
   Terrestrial Hero Style is an unarmed style, but it may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>Not even the Blessed Isle is immune to being slowly shaped by the lapping waves of the Inland Sea. It is the inexorable nature of water that no defense or armor can keep it out forever - and water is patient.
   An attack or clinch that is supplemented by this Charm and hits ignores one point of soak from a target's armor. If the attack misses, the Exalt gains no benefit. Using this Charm against a single target multiple times within the same scene stacks the effect - the first attack ignores one point of armor, the second ignores two, and so on. The attacks do not physically harm the armor, just find wiggle-room through joints and between straps. Only the Exalt using the Charm gains this benefit. This Charm occurs before taking into account the effect of piercing attacks.
   At Essence 3 or higher, the martial artist may spend one Willpower as a part of this Charm to also ignore an equal amount of Hardness for a single attack.
   Example: Ragara Minh is working hard to keep the local tributaries in line, but they hired an outcaste mercenary to defend their interests. Her foe is wearing a jade reinforced breastplate, with a Hardness of 8. Minh has already landed four successful attacks using Pounding Surf Style, but she is having trouble getting through the armor's Hardness. In her next opening, Minh uses the Charm again and spends a temporary Willpower. She ignores five points of the armor's soak and treats her target as Hardness 3. The next time she uses this Charm (without spending Willpower), she ignores six points of armor but is again facing Hardness 8.</description>

        <description>At low tide, the waters of the Inland Sea pull away from the beach to reveal hundreds of shellfish living on shore. In this moment of vulnerability, the seagulls smash them against the rocks. It is in the same vein that the Exalt using this technique rolls a target's defenses away so that her friends can strike.
   This Charm supplements a clinch attack or an opposed grapple check. On a successful attack, the martial artist gets her victim into a hold (she may not break the grapple or crush for damage). Extra successes on the roll reduce the victim's soak from armor by one bashing and one lethal for each, effective until the martial artist's next action. If she uses this Charm as her next action in the same grapple, it continues to reduce the armor's effectiveness, and the effects stack. Losing control of the clinch or not using the Charm for one action ends the effect.</description>

        <description>Calm seas are safer to sail, but hitting the ocean does not hurt it. Raging oceans kill many sailors, but a sound ship and good crew can break them. Terrestrial Hero Form lets the martial artist mimic aspects of both.
   When he assumes this form, the Exalt divvies up his Martial Arts score between aiding his grapples and adding to his soak. Each point spent on soak adds two bashing and one lethal to his soaks for the scene. A point spent on grapples gives him one extra die to all such rolls for the scene. His choice determines the form's appearance: more points to grappling gives him a rolling, violent aspect, while more points to soak lend a calm, roll-with-it attitude to his movements.
   He can take a miscellaneous action (-1 DV) to refocus and reassign his dots, also changing the appearance of his style. Some who observe students of this martial art become convinced that the martial artist is practicing two different styles rather than one.</description>

        <description>An ocean is a hungry beast, and it feeds itself with riptides, the strong currents that drag unsuspecting swimmers and sailors under the sea. Exalted practicing this style learn to treat their enemies the same way, dragging as many as possible under their waves.
   The martial artist becomes capable of wrestling several foes to the ground at once. For each mote she spends, she makes a grapple attack against a single target within range. She may hold, crush or throw anyone she successfully clinches, as normal.
   On subsequent actions, the Exalt may continue to grapple all her victims (making multiple opposed grapple checks), but doing so requires her to use Riptide Method again and spend one mote per person. If she is grappling fewer than her limit, she may use the Charm and spend up to her maximum to grapple people who are currently free. Otherwise, she must release all of her victims but one.
       Martial artists using this Charm may not spend more motes than they have functional limbs. For most, this is four.</description>

        <description>The salty embrace of the sea is loving but deadly. Every minute spent in mother ocean's arms makes it increasingly hard to ever leave. Practitioners of this style learn how to make their clinches increasingly deadly as they seep inside their foes' defenses.
   Initiating a clinch attack, the martial artist pulls his victim into an awkward position and puts pressure on her throat and diaphragm, forcing the air from her lungs and keeping it out. The victim begins to suffocate almost immediately, and her only recourse is to escape the clinch as quickly as possible. Clinch damage from this attack is normal as the Charm's target uses the last of her air, but each successive action in which the Terrestrial Hero Style practitioner continues to control the grapple, the victim takes one additional level of unsoakable bashing damage from suffocation.
   Drowning Embrace ends when the martial artist loses control of the clinch or chooses to end it. It has no effect on creatures that do not need to breathe, such as constructs or zombies.</description>

        <description>Lifting a grappled victim high into the air, the martial artist brings her victim down hard on her knee, head or another hard, unyielding object. With a sickening crunch, the target's bones break much as a ship's hull shatters against the rocks during a storm.
   If the clinch attack or opposed grapple check goes in the Exalt's favor, she inflicts lethal damage instead of bashing. For each previous action in which the martial artist controlled the clinch, add one die to the damage roll, to a maximum equal to the Exalt's Martial Arts. If it causes the loss of even a single health level, her attack causes great damage, often irreparable, to the victim's spine, completely paralyzing him from the waist down. Victims of this Charm suffer the effects of having both legs amputated (see Exalted, p. 152) and usually cannot use their Dodge DV without stunts or special training, and then likely at severe internal penalties.
   As usual, Exalted who suffer this Charm regain use of their legs as soon as the damage inflicted at the same time as the injury heals. Mortals never heal this injury without signi cant (and dangerous) surgery.</description>

            <description>The techniques of the Terrestrial Hero Style are some of the easiest for Dragon-Blooded to learn. Sharing an aspect with the element of Water, there is no style that meshes more perfectly with the Water Aspects' blend of natural and relentless violence. For Dragon-Blooded, Terrestrial Hero Style is a natural style—they treat its Charms like normal Charms for the Martial Arts Ability, and they can learn or create additional Charms in its cascade. Blade-Deflecting Palm and Become the Hammer are examples of Martial Arts Charms that Dragon-Blooded can add to this style. Charms outside the structure of the normal Terrestrial Hero Style can be learned only by Dragon-Blooded, Eclipse Caste Solars and Moonshadow Caste Abyssals.
   This style is one of the most common among Dragon-Blooded throughout Creation, simply for the sheer utility of being able to create custom Charms for unarmed combat. It sees particular use among the Dragon-Blooded of the West, of course, but it is also taught in some schools on the Blessed Isle, in Lookshy and, surprisingly, in the hot South. Dragon-Blooded there sometimes prefer to emulate the element they find most rare and valuable.
   Terrestrial Hero Style is an unarmed style, but it may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>This Charm focuses the Exalt's Essence into her hands and feet, transforming them into deadly weapons. A punch or kick delivered in conjunction with this Charm inflicts lethal damage instead of bashing damage and is considered an attack with a lethal weapon for the purposes of determining whether the target can parry. One mote must be spent per attack even if the attacks are part of a flurry.</description>

        <description>Even given the existence of Charms such as Blade-deflecting Palm, an unarmed martial artist facing an armed opponent is usually in great danger. This Charm lets him equal the odds by disarming his opponent more easily by negating the normal -2 penalty for disarming an opponent (see Exalted, p. 158). The Charm does not allow the character to break or take the weapon, but he can choose in which direction the weapon will land, which will be (5 + 1 per additional success) yards away from its wielder.</description>

            <description>This Charm adds two automatic successes to any attempt to disarm an opponent in hand-to-hand combat (effectively negating the normal -2 external penalty). It also imposes a -2 internal penalty on the victim's roll to maintain her grip on the weapon. This Charm does not allow the martial artist to take or break the weapon. If the weapon is knocked loose, it flies one yard away per success by which the victim's player failed to succeed on her roll. The martial artist chooses in which direction the weapon goes. With a stunt, he can even choose how the weapon lands (such as sticking horizontally out of a wooden wall) or aim for a specific point (such as an open window). Even with a stunt, though, the disarming character cannot cause the loose weapon to do more than startle or distract another character (i.e., he cannot use it to inflict damage).</description>

        <description>The Dragon-Blood's intimate connection with the Elemental Dragons permits her to inflict an elemental effect in conjunction with her hand-to-hand attacks. On a successful barehanded attack, the Dragon-Blood may also inflict an elemental effect appropriate to her aspect on the target. Air directs a mighty burst of wind at the target, forcing his player to roll (Dexterity + Athletics), difficulty 4, to keep the character from falling. Earth roots the target to the spot, preventing him from moving and inflicting a -2 penalty on his DDV and any actions he takes until the Dragon-Blood's next action. Fire sets the target ablaze for a single action, inflicting four levels of lethal damage in addition to the Dragon-Blood's normal damage dice pool. Water  lls the target's lungs with seawater, adding three ticks before his next action due to violent coughing. Wood poisons the target's blood, causing him to suffer a -1 penalty on all actions for the scene if he fails a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll.
   This Charm is actually a cluster of Charms, one for each of the five elements. A Dragon-Blood can learn multiple versions of this Charm (and even combine two or more into a Combo), but he must learn the one associated with his aspect element first. Regardless of which version is used, the Charm is always considered a Water Aspect Charm for purposes of determining whether the one-mote surcharge for out-of-aspect Charms applies. Therefore, a Fire Aspect who puts the Fire, Water and Wood versions of the Charm into a single Combo must pay a total Essence cost of six motes (one mote per individual Charm plus one surcharge mote per Charm), while a Water Aspect with the same Combo need pay only three motes.</description>

   If the Terrestrial has Essence 3+, the target's player makes a ([Stamina + Resistance] or Willpower) roll after resolving all attacks in the flurry at a difficulty equal to the number of attacks that hit. On a failure, the target fills all her remaining undamaged health levels with unsoakable levels of bashing damage.</description>

        <description>The character uses frigid bonds of Essence to maintain a grappling hold on her opponent. The character attempts a hold attack on her opponent in a clinch normally and uses this Charm. If the attack succeeds, the character can then let go and act normally at the beginning of her next action. Her opponent, however, remains held and inactive as if by the attacker for an additional number of actions equal to the attacker's Essence score. The attacker cannot crush or throw her victim using this Charm.
   The victim can attempt to break free normally, as if the attacker were maintaining the hold. The victim's player reflexively rolls ([Strength or Dexterity] + Martial Arts) on each action and compares his successes to the attacker's initial grapple roll. If the victim's player scores more successes on a single roll (not cumulatively), the victim breaks free but does not assert control of the grapple, obviously. Even if the opponent cannot break free, the Charm's grip automatically expires and releases him in a few actions.
   The Terrestrial hero can use this Charm to immobilize multiple opponents one after the other, and she can enhance the clinch by placing this Charm in a Combo.</description>

        <description>The character can now maintain a crushing clinch after he ceases to touch his opponent. The character attempts a normal clinch attack and uses this Charm. If the clinch attack succeeds, the attacker can let go and act normally again on his next action after inflicting his damage. The victim continues to be crushed by icy waves of Essence for an additional number of actions equal to the attacker's Essence score. This damage is equal to the damage the attacker inflicted on the action when he activated this Charm. The victim can attempt to break free normally, as if the attacker were maintaining the clinch. To do so, the victim's player reflexively rolls ([Strength or Dexterity] + Martial Arts) on each action and compares her successes to the attacker's initial grapple roll. If the victim's player scores more successes on a single roll (not cumulatively), the victim breaks free but does not assert control of the grapple. Even if the opponent cannot break free, she is automatically freed once the duration of this Charm expires.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the character can hold a number of targets equal to her permanent Essence without her player splitting her dice pool. In addition, this attack can be made at a range of (Essence x 5) yards. The opponents can be standing together or separately. As long as they are in range, the attacker's player rolls normally for her character to attempt to place each of them in a hold, rendering them inactive. The player rolls each hold attempt separately with her full dice pool, but doing so is still only one action altogether - not one action per victim.
   Any victim of this Charm can attempt to break free normally, though doing so does not give the victim control of the grapple. Unless any of them break free, all opponents are held for a number of actions equal to the character's Martial Arts score. Once the duration of this Charm ends, all opponents are automatically freed. The attacker must maintain the holds as if she were maintaining normal holds. Taking any other non-reflexive action automatically frees everyone affected by this Charm.</description>

            <description>The techniques of the Terrestrial Hero Style are some of the easiest for Dragon-Blooded to learn. Sharing an aspect with the element of Water, there is no style that meshes more perfectly with the Water Aspects' blend of natural and relentless violence. For Dragon-Blooded, Terrestrial Hero Style is a natural style—they treat its Charms like normal Charms for the Martial Arts Ability, and they can learn or create additional Charms in its cascade. Blade-Deflecting Palm and Become the Hammer are examples of Martial Arts Charms that Dragon-Blooded can add to this style. Charms outside the structure of the normal Terrestrial Hero Style can be learned only by Dragon-Blooded, Eclipse Caste Solars and Moonshadow Caste Abyssals.
   This style is one of the most common among Dragon-Blooded throughout Creation, simply for the sheer utility of being able to create custom Charms for unarmed combat. It sees particular use among the Dragon-Blooded of the West, of course, but it is also taught in some schools on the Blessed Isle, in Lookshy and, surprisingly, in the hot South. Dragon-Blooded there sometimes prefer to emulate the element they find most rare and valuable.
   Terrestrial Hero Style is an unarmed style, but it may be practiced while in armor.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the character can escape from being grappled by literally flowing through the arms of his opponent. For each mote of Essence he spends on this Charm, the player adds two dice to the reflexive ([Strength or Dexterity] + Martial Arts) roll for his character to escape from clinches and holds. In addition, the player can also add this same bonus to any Larceny roll made to escape from bonds or for any Athletics roll made to squeeze through tight spaces. The character cannot spend more motes on this Charm than he has dots of permanent Essence.</description>

        <description>A Dragon-Blood can use this Charm whenever her player makes a reflexive roll for the character to escape from a clinch or hold. She can also use it for a reflexive roll intended to help her escape any sort of bonds. Having done so, the character can act normally in her action with no penalty to dice pools, regardless of whether the roll succeeds or not. That is, she is not considered inactive despite being bound or grappled as her body flows and twists in ways no mere mortal can imitate.</description>

            <description>This curious Terrestrial martial arts style first emerged among the slave pens of the distant East. According to the tale passed down by the style's practitioners, it originated on a particular Guild plantation, where slaves worked to harvest drugs that assisted in achieving Essence sight. These slaves were forbidden tools or possessions of any sort beyond the most minimal clothing, and any fighting within the pens was punished severely; but it seemed normal to their keepers when the hallucinogen-addled slaves took to spending their evenings in wild, ecstatic dance. This dance, created by a rebellious young slave named Silver Leaf, was actually a developing form of unarmed combat, intended to be used to rise up and overthrow the plantation. Silver Leaf's unexpected Exaltation at the behest of the Wood Dragon acted as the catalyst for this uprising; extending her nascent style's precepts into a supernatural martial arts form, she tore the plantation apart and led the slaves into the forest.
       Most scattered, but a few freedmen stayed on with Silver Leaf, pledging themselves as her loyal students and followers. Now the Swaying Grass Dance Style has spread to all five Poles of Creation, in both its limited form as a surreptitious slave style, and its true form as an Exalted combat art. Rumor has it that Silver Leaf still walks the Threshold, selling herself into plantation slavery for the purpose of causing uprisings among the pens. This Terrestrial martial arts style is aspected toward the element of Wood.
   Weapons and Armor: Swaying Grass Dance style exclusively employs kicks; its Charms will not function with unarmed punches. As such, kicks, iron boots and god-kicking boots are considered in-style weapons, and are treated as unarmed attacks for the purpose of its Charms. This style is not compatible with armor.

She takes no penalties for fighting prone, and may rise from prone reflexively. These benefits may not lower the character's Speed below 3. She is also considered to be dancing while this Form is active, and any attempts to recognize this Charm's activation as a form of combat-readiness suffer a -2 external penalty.</description>

So convincing is her feint that the opponent is absolutely convinced the next strike will come in from above. The character makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack. If the character's successes on the attack roll exceed the target's Dodge MDV, the attack is unexpected. If the character is standing in tall grass or shallow water, or the terrain otherwise obscures her legs and feet from view, add two bonus successes to the attack. This Charm's unnatural mental influence costs one point of Willpower to resist. Targets become immune to this Charm for the rest of the scene after spending three points of Willpower.</description>

        <description>The harsh upbringing of this style's practitioners makes them fast to react to danger. Those who land one blow upon a Grass Dancer rarely manage a second. When the character is struck and this Charm is activated, the martial artist goes cartwheeling (attacker's Strength x 5) yards away, exactly as though she suffered from knockback, save that the character controls which direction he tumbles in and whether or not she strikes any objects.</description>

        <description>Those who would oppose a practitioner of the Swaying Grass Dance Style reap the whirlwind. Shuffling along with a dizzying series of quick-steps and cartwheels, the character pursues an adversary. This Charm must be targeted against another character when activated; this target must be within unarmed striking range, and must have already attacked the martial artist within the current scene. For the duration of the Charm, the martial artist gains whatever mobility is necessary to follow her target. Her Move speed matches that of her target, even if Charms such as Leaping Dodge Method or Rolling With the Wind Method are employed. This pursuit explicitly includes whatever acrobatic prowess is necessary to pursue a flying opponent, so long as there are trees or other structures to climb through in order to reach them. Inescapable Tumbleweed Prana will not allow the character to follow a target who moves away by teleporting.</description>

            <description>This curious Terrestrial martial arts style first emerged among the slave pens of the distant East. According to the tale passed down by the style's practitioners, it originated on a particular Guild plantation, where slaves worked to harvest drugs that assisted in achieving Essence sight. These slaves were forbidden tools or possessions of any sort beyond the most minimal clothing, and any fighting within the pens was punished severely; but it seemed normal to their keepers when the hallucinogen-addled slaves took to spending their evenings in wild, ecstatic dance. This dance, created by a rebellious young slave named Silver Leaf, was actually a developing form of unarmed combat, intended to be used to rise up and overthrow the plantation. Silver Leaf's unexpected Exaltation at the behest of the Wood Dragon acted as the catalyst for this uprising; extending her nascent style's precepts into a supernatural martial arts form, she tore the plantation apart and led the slaves into the forest.
       Most scattered, but a few freedmen stayed on with Silver Leaf, pledging themselves as her loyal students and followers. Now the Swaying Grass Dance Style has spread to all five Poles of Creation, in both its limited form as a surreptitious slave style, and its true form as an Exalted combat art. Rumor has it that Silver Leaf still walks the Threshold, selling herself into plantation slavery for the purpose of causing uprisings among the pens. This Terrestrial martial arts style is aspected toward the element of Wood.

        <description>The character listens to the music pounding in her heart, and then whirls to the attack. She launches an unarmed martial arts attack, and, if it inflicts any damage, immediately launches another. These attacks utilize the character's full dice pool, ignore Rate, and levy a DV penalty equal to the highest penalty incurred by any one attack. The character may launch a total number of attacks equal to her Performance, or until she fails to inflict damage, whichever comes first.</description>

        <description>The character imposes her rhythm upon another, taking control of the battle. This Charm begins with a low, sudden leg sweep. The character makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack. Resolve this attack normally; if the attack strikes the target, they suffer automatic knockdown. Thereafter the martial artist shuffles about her downed foe, confusing him and buffeting him to the ground with her legs should he try to escape. So long as the martial artist remains within unarmed attacking range of her prone target, all the target's attempts to rise from prone provoke a reflexive contested Dexterity + Martial Arts roll. If the target wins, he rises from prone successfully. If the Grass Dancer wins or ties, the target remains prone. Grass Reaping Posture lasts until the martial artist moves out of range or until the target successfully rises from prone.</description>

            <description>As most Dragon-Blooded prefer to arm themselves with variations on the traditional daiklave, some inhabitants of the South have turned that region's idiosyncratic signature weapon into the center of an odd combat style. The form weapon for Golden Exhalation Style is the firewand, which may be capped by a bayonet for close-up use. Practitioners of this martial art dance about a battlefield elegantly, swinging their bronze weapons back and forth to send snakes of flame into their enemies' faces.
   Schools of this style are extremely rare outside the South, given the price of keeping one's weapon armed. Golden Exhalation Style shares an affinity with Fire Aspects, so they need not pay any elemental surcharge when using Charms of this style. This style is incompatible with armor.

        <description>Careful aim begets a better shot. Following a target with her eyes and her weapon, the Exalt uses Essence to help steady her arm and focus her sight. Invoking this Charm after three ticks of the Aim action increases the maximum bonus from aiming by three. The Exalt may then take another Aim action and gain a greater bonus to her shot. Other than increasing the maximum bonus, this Charm does not change the way the Aim action works.</description>

        <description>When opponents are insolent, they deserve to be punished. Dragon-Blooded who know this Charm take great delight in surprising their opponents who caper and mock, thinking themselves too far away to be chastised.
   A firewand attack supplemented by this Charm burns hotter and brighter than usual, doubling its range (and range increment). At Essence 4 or higher, an Exalt may spend an extra mote on this Charm to triple the attack's range instead. Targets who are familiar with firewands but not with this Charm may be taken by surprise by such a long-ranged attack.</description>

        <description>In some stories, the Great Garda's wing once swept across the entirety of the South and burned it into the harsh wasteland it is now. This technique emulates that devastation.
   This Charm allows a single attack to be split among multiple targets as the Exalt sweeps his firewand in an arc, catching them all in the flames. He can choose to target a number of victims equal to his Essence, but they must all be within range of the firewand blast and within a single 90-degree arc. The Exalt's player rolls a single attack and divides successes up among his targets as he wishes. Resolve each target individually.</description>

        <description>Calling on her experience with the flame and firewand to protect her, the Exalt uses both as defensive tools. Her lethal soak increases by two, and she gains an additional two points of lethal soak against all types of flame. She can catch attacks of all kinds on her firewand and deflect them - she can parry with her firewand, which gains a Defense of +2 for the rest of the scene. And finally, she can use her own Essence to fuel her bursts of flame. Until the Charm ends, she can reflexively spend one mote to load her firewand rather than taking an action and using a charge of firedust to do so.</description>

        <description>The Exalt angles his firewand so that another firewand's burst flies right down its barrel, and he uses his Essence to solidify it into the ammunition for his next shot. In order to perform this prodigious feat, his player must make a (Wits + Martial Arts) roll and get as many or more successes than the attacker's player did on her attack. If Golden Exhalation Form is active, that +2 applies to this roll. This replaces his normal defense attempt.
   If his firewand is already loaded with a charge, the martial artist may fire twice on his next action, but waiting longer than that gives the Essence-charge time to dissipate. If his weapon was empty, the Essence coalesces into real firedust.
    For an additional mote, the Exalt may use any fire-based attack or effect in this manner.</description>

   Weapons and Armor: The Charms of this style can be used only with firewands or other flame-discharge weapons. Armor does not hinder the practice of this style.</description>

        <description>Carefully positioning herself, the Exalt ensures that her firewand's burst of flame will hit somebody, even if the original target manages to dodge her deadly attack. She lines up two victims before attacking, then looses her flames. If the first target successfully dodges the attack, all the attack's successes are then applied to the second target, who was behind the first.
   This Charm increases the range of a firewand's attack by five yards, but only if that extra range is necessary to reach the second target.</description>

            <description>As most Dragon-Blooded prefer to arm themselves with variations on the traditional daiklave, some inhabitants of the South have turned that region's idiosyncratic signature weapon into the center of an odd combat style. The form weapon for Golden Exhalation Style is the firewand, which may be capped by a bayonet for close-up use. Practitioners of this martial art dance about a battlefield elegantly, swinging their bronze weapons back and forth to send snakes of flame into their enemies' faces.

        <description>Invoking this Charm as a last-ditch effort, the Exalt fuels his firewand with his own Essence, causing the weapon to instantly erupt with a great gout of flame. The character's player makes a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll. Successes on this roll act as a defense and attack.
   First, the fire burst startles and distracts a melee attacker, so successes on the Martial Arts roll replace the Exalt's DV against this attack. Even if the attack would still hit, wooden weapons are destroyed by the flame (before inflicting damage).
   Second, the same successes that became the DV apply as a counterattack against the attacker. Neither of these methods applies against anyone outside the firewand's range, so archers and thrown-weapon specialists can make things difficult. Even in those cases, Flaming River Burns the Boat can destroy wooden arrows and weapons before they harm the Exalt.</description>

            <description>Few practice this style outside the Marukan Alliance. Dragon-Blooded who are not born to the Mayhiros or another influential clan often become circuit riders, powerful individuals in their own rights, or warrior-priests of the horse-god Hiparkes. A small sect of warriors called the Lightning Hooves of Hiparkes does not guide the region's breeding programs or worship. Instead, these warriors use the gifts of their god to fight in his name, standing against those who would cast him down or deny others his worship. The Dragon-Blooded members of the Lightning Hooves created a special style of equestrian martial arts. After many years of service and demonstrated prowess at riding and combat, mortal members may receive the gift of Essence mastery in a secret rite, so they can use the style as well.
       Lightning Hoof Style is elementally neutral. No Dragon-Blooded aspect needs to spend extra Essence to use its Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Warriors who fight with this style can use spears, long spears (lances), lassoes and self or composite bows as form weapons for this style, but they may not use any other martial arts weapons with its Charms until they learn or study another style. Lightning Hoof martial artists may not wear any armor with a mobility penalty with this style, as it hinders the sort of riding these warriors practice.
   Complementary Abilities: Most Charms in this style are meant to be used on horseback. Though they can be activated on foot, they could suffer decreased effectiveness or not work at all. Because a student of this style must clearly be a consummate rider as well as a dedicated martial artist, a practitioner must have a Ride rating equal to the Martial Arts prerequisite listed for each Charm.</description>

        <description>The horse guides the rider as much as the other way around. A character can activate this Charm anytime he is about to fall from his horse, whether because he failed to control his mount or because he charged and struck a foe with his spear. Instead of falling, he remains balanced and calm on horseback.
   On his action, a rider can also use this Charm to perform any single acrobatic feat on horseback without risk of falling. For instance, he could perform a handstand on the saddle or stand on one stirrup to kick a foe in passing. The player still needs to make appropriate rolls for the character to perform difficult actions or attacks, but there's no need for a Ride roll to stay mounted or danger that he will fall off his horse. This also eliminates any penalties to the Dodge DV for riding.
   If something forces the character from his horse, he can return to the saddle as a reflexive action on any tick in which he and his horse are within movement range of each other. Doing so typically involves flipping over the horse's lowered head as it runs toward the character or vaulting up onto its broad torso as it runs past.</description>

        <description>Marukan hunters give chase to the prey of the plains. On the back of a superior Marukan steed, they run alongside their prey, matching speeds before they wound it with an arrow. By carefully targeting the prey's weakest locations, the hunter can be sure both that the creature will bleed out quickly and that the wound will remain clean. Attacking with this Charm decreases the duration between damage due to blood loss by one minute, such that a creature with Stamina 4 suffers one level of lethal damage from bleeding after three minutes instead of four. Creatures with Stamina 1 lose one level every six actions or 30 seconds. (See p. 151 of Exalted.) The difficulty to close the wound and stop the bleeding (for Exalted closing their own wounds or for healers closing others') increases by an amount equal to the attacker's Essence. Wounds made by this attack never become infected.</description>

        <description>Rider and mount are one. When the regal horse breaks into a gallop, the rider feels its muscles move and moves naturally close to the steed's back. Should the horse rear, the rider is already leaning forward so they both can balance. When the warrior needs to evade an arrow or turn a blade, her companion helps, and when she needs to strike an enemy down, it lends its weight. Rather than adding one to DV when on horseback, the horse and rider add two. Likewise, those suffering close combat attacks from the horse or rider reduce their DVs by two instead of just one. When firing her bow, the character adds two dice to all attacks and 50 yards to the weapon's Range.</description>

        <description>The character and his horse work together seamlessly as natural partners. When the character attacks a target, the horse follows his lead and attacks the same target at the same time. Activating this Charm as part of an attack, the character's horse attacks the same target immediately after, benefiting from any onslaught penalty the character might have inflicted. This Charm can be used only when attacking a target that is also a valid target for the horse, and it does not count as the horse's action. The Charm provides an extra action for the horse.</description>

        <description>Anyone who cannot stay in the saddle does not deserve respect and is bereft of honor. Although this technique is rarely deadly, it is of great use when a warrior wishes to disgrace his enemies. Running her horse alongside her enemy's, she leaps across a distance of up to (Martial Arts) yards onto the target's horse. She then immediately grabs her foe, disentangles him from the reins and throws him to the ground before leaping back to her horse.
       Leaping behind her target makes it hard for the target to wrestle with her, and sitting in the saddle makes it difficult to dodge. The target suffers a -2 penalty to either DV, unless he is using Two Cannot Fall or other Charms to make dodging easier. When the character beats her target's DV, she throws him to the ground. Regardless of whether she succeeds, she leaps back to her mount at the end of her action. At the Storyteller's discretion, falling from a horse traveling at great speed can inflict damage.</description>

            <name>Lightning Hoof Style</name>
            <description>Few practice this style outside the Marukan Alliance. Dragon-Blooded who are not born to the Mayhiros or another influential clan often become circuit riders, powerful individuals in their own rights, or warrior-priests of the horse-god Hiparkes. A small sect of warriors called the Lightning Hooves of Hiparkes does not guide the region's breeding programs or worship. Instead, these warriors use the gifts of their god to fight in his name, standing against those who would cast him down or deny others his worship. The Dragon-Blooded members of the Lightning Hooves created a special style of equestrian martial arts. After many years of service and demonstrated prowess at riding and combat, mortal members may receive the gift of Essence mastery in a secret rite, so they can use the style as well.
       Lightning Hoof Style is elementally neutral. No Dragon-Blooded aspect needs to spend extra Essence to use its Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Warriors who fight with this style can use spears, long spears (lances), lassoes and self or composite bows as form weapons for this style, but they may not use any other martial arts weapons with its Charms until they learn or study another style. Lightning Hoof martial artists may not wear any armor with a mobility penalty with this style, as it hinders the sort of riding these warriors practice.
   Complementary Abilities: Most Charms in this style are meant to be used on horseback. Though they can be activated on foot, they could suffer decreased effectiveness or not work at all. Because a student of this style must clearly be a consummate rider as well as a dedicated martial artist, a practitioner must have a Ride rating equal to the Martial Arts prerequisite listed for each Charm.</description>

        <description>Some Marukan families are known for their hospitality. They take visitors in and treat them as blood, keeping them fed and happy and close. Some say they coddle enemies even more. The warrior-priests of Hiparkes try to epitomize that aspect of Marukan culture. This Charm enhances a clinch attack made from the saddle by eliminating any environmental penalties the character would normally suffer on the attempt, especially when galloping by. Additionally, the martial artist gains one automatic success on the attempt. Lightning Hooves use this Charm as much to extract friends from danger as they do to capture their enemies.</description>

        <description>A true horseman of the plains is loath to leave his mount and companion behind, especially in battle, but there is power in this technique. Riding faster than the wind, the horse stops at the command of its master who, leaning forward, launches off his partner's back at his enemies. He gifts a target with a single strike of his spear or arrow from his bow. Should the character choose the spear, the attack has so much force that it cannot be parried without using a Charm. If he attacks with an arrow, it moves so quickly that the target cannot dodge without using a Charm. Finally, add a number of dice equal to the martial artist's Essence to the attack's raw damage.</description>

            <description>There is a bureau in the Thousand Scales, the Splendid and Just Arbiters of Purpose, that was created to find and recruit Dragon-Blooded children who Exalt in the Threshold. Once, there was a bureau member named Harim. He himself had been just such a peasant-born child, and he had grown up to fight for - and to recruit others like himself to fight for - the righteous cause of the Realm. The intense and direct Harim, however, found himself doubting the ability of the Dynasty to rule, and soon became so disgusted that he could see no moral option but to abandon his adopted land.
   With him, Harim brought a moldering manual that he'd unearthed during a mission in his youth. He and his company had been sent to eliminate a group of rebels whose passion and surprising martial prowess threatened the Realm's hold on one of its richer satrapies. After the mission was concluded, he ought properly to have turned it in to his superiors, but Harim had been impressed by the zeal of those he had been ordered to eliminate and decided to read the tome - if only to understand their ideals. It turned out to be a history book: with fervent, persuasive words, it detailed an ancient society of Old Realm Terrestrials who had sought nothing but to destroy great evils, expose great lies, and correct great injustices. He realized quickly it was also a guide to their signature philosophical style.
   Harim, looking for a way to improve his fallen and corrupt Age, found the idea of such a society appealing, but did little to pursue it while he lived in the Realm beyond surreptitiously mastering the style. When he left, he finally decided to do something about it. He spent some time meditating upon the current needs of Creation, then he began his own group. Harim first gathered those he knew to be of a similar mindset, then used his considerable ability at recruitment to bring others into the fold. In an ironic, self-conscious tip of the hat to his origins, he named them the Just and Truthful Arbiters of Light, and referred to their unique martial art as The Path Of The Arbiter Style. Urging his Arbiters to consider themselves outside national affiliations and power struggles, Harim encourages those in his fledgling organization to first perfect their virtue and ideals, then to judge - and act on - each situation based solely on its morality.
   Those who practice The Path Of The Arbiter Style only rarely study elaborate moves or intricate katas. Indeed, although she won't ignore her sheer martial skills, an Arbiter's physical training always takes a decided back seat to extended meditation and tests of faith. Anyone can be passionate, but characters with this style have been taught how to concentrate and use their passion. Each must go through a long, lone ordeal to refine her own ardor and emotional endurance, and when she returns, she must be utterly unshakable in her beliefs. Every single Arbiter must return clear-eyed from her own wilderness - knowing her own strength, completely certain of her capabilities, and sure enough of herself that she will not hesitate when the timecomes, at last, to destroy the unrighteous.
   Weapons and Armor: Not all Arbiters use the same weapon, although they all use hand-to-hand weapons. The Path Of The Arbiter Style emphasizes the idea that there is no one way to serve the cause of righteousness, and each method - so long as it is honorable - should be as respected as any other. A beginning student must choose which weapon she wishes to use when she learns Meditation on the Enemy, and thenceforth, that weapon is - for her, at least - the style's signature weapon.
   The Path of the Arbiter also shows that fortitude comes from within and virtue comes from devotion to an ideal, not from wealth. A practitioner of this style cannot bulwark herself behind armor that has a Resources value greater than her Martial Arts (this value includes cost increases for magical bonuses, excellent quality, and so on; shields add 1 to this number, for this purpose only). Furthermore, all armor must display either the character's personal crest or the crest of something that she has sworn to defend or serve.</description>

        <description>Old is the tradition of, "Know thy enemy," and important for those who would pass judgment. This Charm grants a Martial Arts specialty of one die against something the Arbiter has set herself to judge. The motes must be committed in the presence of that thing - be it a person, a group, or an idea - and so long as they're committed, the specialty remains. It acts in all ways like a normal specialty dot.
   While Meditation on the Enemy is active, the martial artist may spend experience to learn the specialty dot, with training times reduced as if she had a tutor. Buying a dot in this fashion ends the Charm. If she ever succeeds in utterly eliminating her enemy, though, the character will gain the experience back.</description>

        <description>The character's inner radiance bulwarks her aura, and her passion shows itself in every line in her face, filling her gaze with fire. This Charm notifies Fate of the Arbiter's current status and intentions, and thereby entirely negates the possibility of collateral damage through any accident of the character's actions or anima (should it become relevant, this should be treated as a perfect defense against anything that could make the character cause unintended harm). It also adds her Martial Arts to the relevant pool for the purposes of calculating her Mental Defense Value.
   Self-sacrifice is a integral part of true dedication. A character using the Path of the Arbiter Form may, at any time, reflexively sacrifice as many aggravated health levels as she wishes in order to instantly gain an equal number of Willpower points. This effect cannot raise her temporary Willpower pool above her permanent Willpower.
   Finally, as the martial artist completes her initial posture, this Charm gathers the spiritual equipment gained through the Charms Forging the Soul-Born Sword and Forging the Armor of Integrity (see below). Once she finishes activating the Path of the Arbiter Form, she may choose to summon either or both of these items immediately and reflexively, for 5 additional motes each and 1 Willpower point.This Form can be activated from horseback.</description>

Every single Arbiter must return clear-eyed from her own wilderness - knowing her own strength, completely certain of her capabilities, and sure enough of herself that she will not hesitate when the timecomes, at last, to destroy the unrighteous.
   Weapons and Armor: Not all Arbiters use the same weapon, although they all use hand-to-hand weapons. The Path Of The Arbiter Style emphasizes the idea that there is no one way to serve the cause of righteousness, and each method - so long as it is honorable - should be as respected as any other. A beginning student must choose which weapon she wishes to use when she learns Meditation on the Enemy, and thenceforth, that weapon is - for her, at least - the style's signature weapon.
   The Path of the Arbiter also shows that fortitude comes from within and virtue comes from devotion to an ideal, not from wealth. A practitioner of this style cannot bulwark herself behind armor that has a Resources value greater than her Martial Arts (this value includes cost increases for magical bonuses, excellent quality, and so on; shields add 1 to this number, for this purpose only). Furthermore, all armor must display either the character's personal crest or the crest of something that she has sworn to defend or serve.</description>

            <description>There is a bureau in the Thousand Scales, the Splendid and Just Arbiters of Purpose, that was created to find and recruit Dragon-Blooded children who Exalt in the Threshold. Once, there was a bureau member named Harim. He himself had been just such a peasant-born child, and he had grown up to fight for - and to recruit others like himself to fight for - the righteous cause of the Realm. The intense and direct Harim, however, found himself doubting the ability of the Dynasty to rule, and soon became so disgusted that he could see no moral option but to abandon his adopted land.
   With him, Harim brought a moldering manual that he'd unearthed during a mission in his youth. He and his company had been sent to eliminate a group of rebels whose passion and surprising martial prowess threatened the Realm's hold on one of its richer satrapies. After the mission was concluded, he ought properly to have turned it in to his superiors, but Harim had been impressed by the zeal of those he had been ordered to eliminate and decided to read the tome - if only to understand their ideals. It turned out to be a history book: with fervent, persuasive words, it detailed an ancient society of Old Realm Terrestrials who had sought nothing but to destroy great evils, expose great lies, and correct great injustices. He realized quickly it was also a guide to their signature philosophical style.
   Harim, looking for a way to improve his fallen and corrupt Age, found the idea of such a society appealing, but did little to pursue it while he lived in the Realm beyond surreptitiously mastering the style. When he left, he finally decided to do something about it. He spent some time meditating upon the current needs of Creation, then he began his own group. Harim first gathered those he knew to be of a similar mindset, then used his considerable ability at recruitment to bring others into the fold. In an ironic, self-conscious tip of the hat to his origins, he named them the Just and Truthful Arbiters of Light, and referred to their unique martial art as The Path Of The Arbiter Style. Urging his Arbiters to consider themselves outside national affiliations and power struggles, Harim encourages those in his fledgling organization to first perfect their virtue and ideals, then to judge - and act on - each situation based solely on its morality.
   Those who practice The Path Of The Arbiter Style only rarely study elaborate moves or intricate katas. Indeed, although she won't ignore her sheer martial skills, an Arbiter's physical training always takes a decided back seat to extended meditation and tests of faith. Anyone can be passionate, but characters with this style have been taught how to concentrate and use their passion. Each must go through a long, lone ordeal to refine her own ardor and emotional endurance, and when she returns, she must be utterly unshakable in her beliefs.

        <description>When it is truly necessary, the character has learned that she can put forth absolutely everything she has to give - and more. This Charm can be used to supplement any action, including reflexive actions such as resisting mental influence. When she spends the motes, the Arbiter may also spend up to three Willpower points at once (five if the relevant action is intended to further her Motivation). Only one of these may be used to channel through a Virtue - the rest must be spent on automatic successes or in some other normally allowable way, so long as they are all spent on a single action.
   The Willpower spent through this Charm must be recovered normally. Secret of Bright-Burning Passion cannot be used to let characters spend Willpower on rolls that don't allow for its expenditure, such as damage.</description>

        <description>Bravery is one of the Arbiter's great advantages, and with this Charm, she can call forth a weapon of righteous fury directly from her own strength. With a cry, she executes a kata as though she were wielding it, and as she comes around, the weapon is in her hands. Arbiters call this the Soul-Born Sword, but in practice, it takes the form of a custom artifact version of the character's Path of the Arbiter Style signature weapon - save that it appears to be made entirely of eye-searing light.
   The player should design whatever artifact weapon she feels is best for her Arbiter, as long as its effective level is no higher than half the character's Valor, rounded up. The weapon requires no commitment and its effective magical material bonuses are those of jade. Players and Storytellers are encouraged to keep in mind that the character has no conscious control over the way her Soul-Born Sword manifests - it is a direct expression of her deepest emotions and ideals.
   The martial artist cannot reforge her Soul-Born Sword unless her Valor score changes enough to change its effective rating, at which point the player may - if she wishes - entirely redesign the weapon from the ground up (as long as it remains the same type, of course). After it has been forged, the weapon shimmers and disappears Elsewhere, ready to be drawn through the use of the Path of the Arbiter Form.</description>

        <description>The undaunted Arbiter can defend herself solely with honor, just as she can strike with only her courage to aid her. Similarly to Forging the Soul-Born Sword, she creates a suit of armor that vanishes Elsewhere, to be recalled by the Path of the Arbiter Form. The player should design artifact armor for her character, with a maximum effective rating equal to half her Temperance, rounded up. The armor requires no commitment, and its effective magical material bonuses are those of jade.
   The Armor of Integrity seems made of blazing light of the same hue as the Arbiter's Soul-Born Sword. It always bears the Arbiter's personal emblem, and it may also display the crest of a person or cause she has sworn to follow. As with Forging the Soul-Born Sword, the armor is a manifestation of deep-rooted personality traits. Its powers cannot be consciously controlled by the character, and it will keep the same form unless her Temperance score shifts enough to change its effective Artifact rating, at which point, the player can redesign it.</description>

        <description>Her heart yearning for a true companion to share her dangers and triumphs, the Arbiter sends out a mental and emotional call. Unlike her Soul-Born Sword and Armor of Integrity, the mount summoned by this Charm is a living creature; it does not go Elsewhere when the character doesn't need it, and its substance isn't spiritual. The mount is, in all ways, a normal Familiar with a dot rating equal to half the character's Compassion, rounded up.
   If the Arbiter already has a mount, she may choose to either make it into a Familiar or, if it's already a Familiar, to improve its rating up to the new one. She may also decide to bring forth another one - in this way, the character can end up with more than one Familiar.
   Although she does not have to, if the martial artist's mount dies, she may use this Charm again to call a new one. If the character's Compassion score shifts enough to change the Familiar's rating, then the Familiar may gain (or lose) whichever capabilities the character's player thinks appropriate.</description>

            <name>The Path Of The Arbiter Style</name>
            <description>There is a bureau in the Thousand Scales, the Splendid and Just Arbiters of Purpose, that was created to find and recruit Dragon-Blooded children who Exalt in the Threshold. Once, there was a bureau member named Harim. He himself had been just such a peasant-born child, and he had grown up to fight for - and to recruit others like himself to fight for - the righteous cause of the Realm. The intense and direct Harim, however, found himself doubting the ability of the Dynasty to rule, and soon became so disgusted that he could see no moral option but to abandon his adopted land.
   With him, Harim brought a moldering manual that he'd unearthed during a mission in his youth. He and his company had been sent to eliminate a group of rebels whose passion and surprising martial prowess threatened the Realm's hold on one of its richer satrapies. After the mission was concluded, he ought properly to have turned it in to his superiors, but Harim had been impressed by the zeal of those he had been ordered to eliminate and decided to read the tome - if only to understand their ideals. It turned out to be a history book: with fervent, persuasive words, it detailed an ancient society of Old Realm Terrestrials who had sought nothing but to destroy great evils, expose great lies, and correct great injustices. He realized quickly it was also a guide to their signature philosophical style.
   Harim, looking for a way to improve his fallen and corrupt Age, found the idea of such a society appealing, but did little to pursue it while he lived in the Realm beyond surreptitiously mastering the style. When he left, he finally decided to do something about it. He spent some time meditating upon the current needs of Creation, then he began his own group. Harim first gathered those he knew to be of a similar mindset, then used his considerable ability at recruitment to bring others into the fold. In an ironic, self-conscious tip of the hat to his origins, he named them the Just and Truthful Arbiters of Light, and referred to their unique martial art as The Path Of The Arbiter Style. Urging his Arbiters to consider themselves outside national affiliations and power struggles, Harim encourages those in his fledgling organization to first perfect their virtue and ideals, then to judge - and act on - each situation based solely on its morality.
   Those who practice The Path Of The Arbiter Style only rarely study elaborate moves or intricate katas. Indeed, although she won't ignore her sheer martial skills, an Arbiter's physical training always takes a decided back seat to extended meditation and tests of faith. Anyone can be passionate, but characters with this style have been taught how to concentrate and use their passion. Each must go through a long, lone ordeal to refine her own ardor and emotional endurance, and when she returns, she must be utterly unshakable in her beliefs. Every single Arbiter must return clear-eyed from her own wilderness - knowing her own strength, completely certain of her capabilities, and sure enough of herself that she will not hesitate when the timecomes, at last, to destroy the unrighteous.
   Weapons and Armor: Not all Arbiters use the same weapon, although they all use hand-to-hand weapons. The Path Of The Arbiter Style emphasizes the idea that there is no one way to serve the cause of righteousness, and each method - so long as it is honorable - should be as respected as any other. A beginning student must choose which weapon she wishes to use when she learns Meditation on the Enemy, and thenceforth, that weapon is - for her, at least - the style's signature weapon.
   The Path of the Arbiter also shows that fortitude comes from within and virtue comes from devotion to an ideal, not from wealth. A practitioner of this style cannot bulwark herself behind armor that has a Resources value greater than her Martial Arts (this value includes cost increases for magical bonuses, excellent quality, and so on; shields add 1 to this number, for this purpose only). Furthermore, all armor must display either the character's personal crest or the crest of something that she has sworn to defend or serve.</description>

        <description>The Arbiter names her enemy's crimes and proclaims judgment. In her mercy, she gives the target one last chance to surrender, repent and do penance. This proclamation is a social attack with a speed of 5 ticks; it must be heard and understood, and may only exert Natural Mental Influence on the target. The character's foe is aware that the Arbiter's burning will is empowering her words, and that his fate now depends on his choice. He has until the martial artist's next action to decide, and if he tarries longer, then he will have chosen not to surrender.
   If the Arbiter's enemy verbally surrenders to her and takes no offensive actions against her, then the martial artist is considered bound not to intentionally harm him as if an Eclipse Caste with an Essence score of 1 had used the Eclipse anima power to ensure it. Moreover, if the enemy's Essence is equal to or lower than the Arbiter's Essence, then he, too, is bound: He is similarly sealed into a bargain not to attack the martial artist and to mend his ways and cease the crimes with which the Arbiter has charged him. If he breaks his oath, then the effect keeping the Arbiter from harming him dissolves.
       Regardless of what happens, so long as the Arbiter is not bound against assaulting the target, her next Martial Arts attack against him is empowered by her judgment.Whether the Arbiter next attacks the target of this Charm on the following action or in the following century, so long as she has kept the motes committed to this Charm, then the total external penalty on her attack roll (including any applicable DVs) will be reduced by her (Essence + Destiny). Furthermore, the strike cuts through every shred of positive fate surrounding him, doing aggravated damage.
   No matter how long it has been since the Meditation on Judgment was first invoked, the magical nature of this terrible blow will be Obvious. A character who decommits the Essence to this Charm will not be disempowering the bindings on either herself or her opponent; she will merely be letting go of the power that would otherwise have enhanced her next attack.</description>

            <description>Perhaps, an aged master of the style posits, there exists a great and terrible creature in the Far East. Many dangerous animals live in the vast jungle: crushing behemoths and mighty predators that can take this creature's life in moments, despite its own size and strength. Of necessity, then, the creature learned to ascend trees in spite of the difficulty presented by its bulk and its shape. In such locations, it could escape its predators, and from such heights, it could descend with precipitous speed upon its prey. Should this creature exist, it would represent vast agility and strength in a single beast. Inspiring is the only word for it.
   Training for this style varies widely between teachers, because how does one emulate a creature one has never seen? Students spend time attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the forest, and schools construct great artificial trees for practice. Teachers hang bronze weights on their students' arms while leaving their legs free, forcing them to grow strong and understand the feeling of great mass in tune with the flexibility of unbound feet. Some go on quests into the jungles to find the beast that instructs them. Some never return.
   This style is aspected to the element of Wood, and neither Water Aspects nor Children of Sextes Jylis pay any elemental surcharge.

        <description>Of all the things that make up the body, the bones are the hardest and the heaviest. Just as the massive beast need not strain against the wind, the Exalt can lock her joints and use the strength of her bones to remain upright despite attack, saving the energy of her muscles for other tasks.
   Each mote spent purchases a single die toward resisting knockdown or knockback. Successfully remaining upright allows the martial artist to regain a number of motes spent on this Charm equal to her Martial Arts.</description>

        <description>Enormous constrictor snakes, all too common in the humid Southeastern Threshold, have such flexible skeletons that they can crush their prey with every ounce of their strength. The giant creature of the jungle can use a different method: It simply falls on its victims.
       Martial artists using this technique can purchase additional dice of crushing damage in a clinch. Each die costs one mote, up to a maximum of the Exalt's Strength plus extra successes on the clinch attack or opposed grapple check. For every two levels of damage inflicted by the attack past the target's soak, the Exalt regains one mote spent on the Charm, to a maximum amount equal to her Martial Arts.</description>

        <description>Once a student advances far enough in her training to learn this Charm, she is prepared to spend her life emulating the royalty of creatures, the beast of legend. After assuming this form, the martial artist walks tall, as if there is no creature larger than himself, yet he moves with a tightrope-walker's easy grace.
   With this Charm active, the Exalt's Essence lends him both mass and delicacy. He adds one die of damage to all unarmed attacks, two dice to grapple attempts and two dots to his Athletics for all purposes. When he opts to make a fierce blow (see Exalted, p. 158), he adds yet another die to damage. Also, his enhanced mass makes him more difficult to injure permanently, and for the rest of the scene, he adds one to his bashing and lethal soaks.</description>

        <description>It might sound like an avalanche, but in the mountainless jungle, that sound can be nothing but the great and terrible creature. It barrels through the forest's old and new growth to overrun and crush its prey.
   Exalts mastering this Charm learn to strengthen their legs with Essence to hurtle toward their foes with great speed. Unfortunately, the technique sacrifices accuracy for the elements of surprise and great impact. Invoking the Rush Attack allows the martial artist to move up to his unimpeded Dash speed (ignoring any penalties to movement) before attacking the enemy in the same action. The first mighty attack at the end of the charge suffers a -1 external penalty but adds (Martial Arts + Essence) to its raw damage.</description>

        <description>One of the most fantastic and terrible aspects of the creature is its ability to escape suddenly into the heights of its jungle home. No one who bears a merely human form can expect to climb with such facility, but a martial artist can learn to mimic it.
       Leaping upward to avoid an attack, the Exalt adds two to his Dodge DV. Should he successfully dodge, he effects an immediate escape. He moves upward, kicking off from any available structures (tree trunks and limbs in the forest, cliffs in the mountains, walls and lampposts in Realm cities, and so on) to propel himself into the sky. He can reach as high as ([Strength + Athletics] x 5) yards in a single action, as long as structures exist that high to support him. He comes to a rest at that height at the end of the escape, assuming he has a place to stand or something to grasp. (If he doesn't, he'd better know the following Charm).
   In areas where there is nothing around to leap from or onto (open fields, the middle of training rooms and such), the martial artist gains only the benefit to his defense from this Charm.</description>

        <description>Over countless centuries, the creature turned its position of safety in the trees into an advantage over its predators and prey. Launching itself from the heights, it could crush its victims into the earth. Students of this style likewise enjoy flattening their enemies by surprising them from above.
   By dropping from above, accelerating and orienting herself with Essence and skill, the martial artist plummets through the air toward her target. The Exalt takes no damage from the fall, even from prodigious heights. She adds her Essence to the attack's raw damage and to the attack's minimum damage.
   The character must fall at least five yards in order to invoke this Charm. Users of the Falling-Without-Fear Assault may also activate it reflexively for only two motes. This latter usage is not an attack; it just allows the warrior to land safely after falling from a height as high as ([Strength + Athletics] x 5) yards.</description>

            <description>Perhaps, an aged master of the style posits, there exists a great and terrible creature in the Far East. Many dangerous animals live in the vast jungle: crushing behemoths and mighty predators that can take this creature's life in moments, despite its own size and strength. Of necessity, then, the creature learned to ascend trees in spite of the difficulty presented by its bulk and its shape. In such locations, it could escape its predators, and from such heights, it could descend with precipitous speed upon its prey. Should this creature exist, it would represent vast agility and strength in a single beast. Inspiring is the only word for it.
   Training for this style varies widely between teachers, because how does one emulate a creature one has never seen? Students spend time attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the forest, and schools construct great artificial trees for practice. Teachers hang bronze weights on their students' arms while leaving their legs free, forcing them to grow strong and understand the feeling of great mass in tune with the flexibility of unbound feet. Some go on quests into the jungles to find the beast that instructs them. Some never return.
   This style is aspected to the element of Wood, and neither Water Aspects nor Children of Sextes Jylis pay any elemental surcharge.

        <description>Despite its great bulk, the beast is deft enough to maneuver itself and avoid the depredations of those that would harm it. Some students of the style even suggest that it uses its massive and flexible limbs to capture its meals and carry them along with it as it flees.
       Learning this Charm enhances its three prerequisites, allowing an Exalt to invoke each of them while controlling a clinch. In the case of Walking-on-the-Dragon Life Defense, invoking it while in either side of a grapple allows the martial artist to use his Dodge DV while grappling, but without the +2 DV bonus.
   When using the other two Charms, the Exalt still needs to flurry if he wants to take a second action while controlling the grapple. Additionally, he may spend an additional two motes on either Charm in order to use his captive as a weapon, inflicting the damage from the attack upon both captive and target.
   No martial artist can learn both this charm and Beyond-The-Idol Perfection</description>

        <description>A few breakaway sifus designed their own cap to the Terrible Ascent-Driven Beast Style. They declared that the martial art succeeded too well in its goal of emulation. Deciding that such strictures limited the style's potential, these masters sought that pinnacle. Even though they respected the terrible beast's relative dexterity, they found it insufficient for a human martial artist to wield.
       Learning this Charm enhances its three prerequisites and the Terrible Ascent-Driven Beast Form Charm. Each of the three prerequisite Charms has a specific movement associated with it: dashing along the ground, leaping upward or diving downward. When a master of this Charm invokes any one of those Charms, she may use any one of those three movements instead of the Charm's normal form of movement. The Essence cost, DV bonus, attack bonus and other effects remain the same, but the direction and distance of the related movement change accordingly. The Exalt may activate Walking-on-the-Dragon Life Defense to dodge upward, to dodge downward (if it is available) or to dash along the ground. Invoking Boulder-of-Intentions Rush Attack, she may gain its effects while leaping up a tree or down a cliff. When the Form Charm is active, the character adds +1 DV to its other benefits.
   No martial artist can learn both this Charm and Held-Without-Hands Perfection.
   Example: Great Oak Father is a master of Terrible Ascent-Driven Beast Style with Beyond-the-Idol Perfection. Encountering a warrior who challenges him, Great Oak activates Boulder-of-Intentions Rush Attack (as written) to rapidly close the distance and land the first strike. Moments later, when the challenger strikes back, Great Oak activates Walking-on-the-Dragon Life Defense. Instead of leaping into the sky when he dodges, the martial artist chooses to dash backward instead, using the method of movement described in Boulder-of-Intentions Rush Attack. He can now benefit from the escape it offers even when he has nothing to support an ascent into the sky.
   Noting that his opponent's armor is delaying his victory, Great Oak Father wants to use Falling-Without-Fear Assault to increase his minimum damage. Without gaining a significant height advantage on his opponent, Great Oak cannot use the Charm as written. Fortunately, Beyond-the-Idol Perfection allows Great Oak to activate the Charm and gain its benefits while using the straight dash movement from Rush Attack. Likewise, if the martial artist were below his opponent but wanted to use the benefits of Rush Attack, he could activate that Charm and then leap upward to attack using the movement from Walking-on-the-Dragon Life Defense.</description>

        <description>The primary technique Falling Blossom martial artists master is that of defending the body of their charge. A practitioner can take arrows and sword blows that were meant for the other person or knock him away from such attacks.
   The martial artist spends one mote to reflexively interpose herself between another person and his attackers as long as the character is within leaping distance. Per the normal rules, leaping distance is equal to (Strength + Athletics) yards straight up or double that horizontally, incurring a -1 DV penalty in combat. When the martial artist interposes himself thus, the attack that was intended for the other person must now contend with the martial artist's Parry or Dodge DV. The use of Parry DV is self-explanatory, but using Dodge DV represents physically maneuvering the other person out of harm's way. Attacks that overcome the martial artist's DV hit the martial artist instead of her charge.
   This Charm serves to defend only a single person, and the martial artist must declare who she intends to protect at the beginning of combat. Once she does so, the character can defend only that person for the remainder of the scene.</description>

        <description>When a warrior fears to die, her fear undermines her concentration. If she hesitates, death will surely find her. When a warrior does not fear death, her recklessness leaves her overexposed and makes her sloppy. A warrior ensures victory only by refusing even to consider whether she could live or die. A Falling Blossom martial artist's devotion to her charge leads her to this assurance.
   When a martial artist activates this Charm, the result of her player's Join Battle roll increases by a number of automatic successes equal to the character's Martial Arts score, since fear does not make her hesitate. In addition, all attacks made during her first action gain one automatic success, as she retains her focus in defense of her charge. The martial artist may not make an active defense with any part of her action, however, so her DVs drop to 0 for the remainder of the action. The martial artist may still benefit from defenses purchased from Charms or persistent effects such as Five-Dragon Blocking Technique or Fivefold Bulwark Stance. Without them, however, the martial artist is vulnerable. This Charm must be activated before the character takes her Join Battle action.</description>

        <description>This technique exemplifies the principle of the Falling Blossom Style: The martial artist is ready to give his life to defend his charge. When he activates this Charm, the martial artist pays one mote and suffers one lethal health level of damage for every die of raw damage he wishes to convert into an automatic health level of damage inflicted upon his target. This damage is an effect of the Charm and cannot be bypassed or neutralized by Charms or other effects that reduce damage without negating the effect. This Charm must be activated after the martial artist's player has rolled for his attack but before he has rolled damage.
   This Charm also presumes combat against an opponent who actively fights back: It's useless for surprise attacks or other attacks on unarmed or unresisting targets. In effect, the martial artist grants his opponent a counterattack that automatically succeeds. Dual Scarlet Blossom Technique cannot be used in circumstances where such a counterat-tack is not possible.</description>

        <description>The character focuses the whole of her being on her charge, surrendering herself to the ideal of that person's victory. For the rest of the scene, the character inflicts lethal damage with her unarmed attacks. Any successful attacks made with a knife convert one die of the attack's final damage to an automatic success. This damage conversion does not apply to attacks made with swords or fists. The character may also substitute her Conviction for her Valor for any rolls made to resist effects based on fear or intimidation for the remainder of the scene, as her devotion to her charge burns away mundane fear and distraction. In fact, the Falling Blossom's devotion is such that she can continue to act after she has been incapacitated. If bashing damage caused the incapacitation, the martial artist simply ignores her incapacitated state. If lethal damage caused the incapacitation, the character will die in number of actions equal to her Stamina as her Dying "health levels" fill up. Nonetheless, she continues to act until she actually drops dead. The character suffers from the normal wound penalties the damage has caused, however (-4 for Incapacitated).
   Any character who is killed while using this Form-type Charm in righteous defense of her charge leaves behind no ghost, and no hungry ghost inhabits her corpse. Her purpose in this incarnation fulfilled, she progresses to the next. Should a necromantic effect attempt to kill the martial artist and make her into a ghost, however, the martial artist's player makes an Essence roll against a difficulty equal to the necromancer's Essence. If the roll succeeds, the martial artist's soul is reborn immediately. Otherwise, she becomes a ghost as dictated by the necromantic effect.</description>

        <description>Learning this Charm shows that the martial artist has learned to dedicate his very soul to battle and service to another. With it, the Falling Blossom makes an unarmed attack (or an attack with a sword or a knife). His player rolls the attack as normal. As long as the attack roll yields even a single success, his attack strikes its target. Should the difficulty of the attack be more than 1 or should the target's DV reduce the successes to 0, the attack still inflicts its base damage. Only a perfect defense can stop this attack.
   The Storyteller should note every experience point spent on the activation of this Charm. Every three points spent purchases a point of the special Destiny Background for the martial artist (see p. 151), though the nature of that destiny is up to the Storyteller. As a general guide, the destiny should provide an opportunity for the martial artist to die in a manner that proves his faithful dedication and leaves him well remembered as an example of virtuous devotion to his charge.</description>

            <description>Martial artists who practice the Falling Blossom Style 036 nd their ultimate worth in service to others. Some practitioners guard the children of Dynastic masters. Others protect religious leaders or heads of state. Some Falling Blossoms wander the world seeking the one person their intuition tells them must live at all costs. The Cult of the Illuminated trains heroic mortal zealots or the occasional Dragon-Blooded convert to protect newly Exalted Lawgivers. No matter who the martial artist protects, he directs his every action in combat to ensuring that person's safety, regardless of the cost to the Falling Blossom himself. Falling Blossom Style has an air aspect, so Dragon-Bloods aspected to Water or Air do not pay elemental surcharges for its Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Swords and knives count as un-armed attacks for the purpose of Falling Blossom Style, but this fighting art is incompatible with the use of armor.
   Complementary Abilities: The same techniques of footwork and mobility that enable a martial artist to avoid damage also enable her to interpose herself between an attack and its intended target. To learn the Falling Blossom Style, a character must already possess at least two dots in Dodge.</description>

        <description>By channeling the power of her faith through meditation and quick exercises, the character rises above discomforts and pains that would otherwise slow her down. Each mote a Falling Blossom spends on this Charm negates one point of penalty caused by pain or disability of her body, such as wound penalties or Crippling effects, for the scene. This Charm does not negate penalties brought on by outside factors, such as environmental penalties to mobility or visibility.</description>

        <description>The ultimate expression of this martial style's ethic is the death of the practitioner in service to his charge. It is, of course, better to survive to serve another day, but that ideal is not always attainable. If a Falling Blossom must die so his charge can live, this Charm helps the martial artist guide the hand of fate just enough to do so under his chosen circumstances.
   This Charm requires preparation. The martial artist meditates and writes a heartbreaking haiku that tells of his readiness to die for his cause. The Loom of Fate itself accepts the doomed martial artist's proposition and realigns events so that his death is honorable - but also gives him a chance to defeat the enemies of his charge. If his enemies hide, he will find them. If they set a trap, he will evade it. Heaven itself will bring them together for a final confrontation.
   Further, any time during the rest of that day that the character channels a Virtue for any roll that helps him toward his destiny, his player gains a number of automatic successes to his roll equal to the channeled Virtue, rather than simply adding dice.
   Although it is considered no downside to the Falling Blossom, using this Charm means that the martial artist's death is assured before the rise of the sun on the next day - often in a manner suggested by his haiku. Should the character somehow cheat death, however - regardless of whether that was his intent - his destiny snarls in the Loom of Fate. The weavers in the Loom must painstakingly pick the snarl apart and reweave all the threads around it, and they are never pleased to have this inconvenience thrust upon them. Holding the trouble against the martial artist, they weave for him a long and ugly future in which he is destined to fail at any important task he undertakes... especially any attempt at suicide. In fact, from that point forward, he gains five dots of the Destiny Background to ensure that very thing. As a final insult, the failed master can never use the Charms of the Falling Blossom Style again.</description>

            <description>Not every martial artist is a calm, temperate master who considers his art exercise and philosophy. Not all of them discover combat secrets from the animal world or while meditating on a mountain. Some of them live in the urban wilderness. They just get into fight after fight and figure out a useful trick or two after someone gives them a hand out of the garbage and a beefsteak for their black eye. If the street fighter is Exalted, these "tricks" can be Charms, which eventually distill into a martial art.
   According to legend, First Pulse Style began with the infamous Nexus pit fighter known by the stage name Blood Tiger. Rumors attributed his skill in the arena to Immaculate training that he received before fleeing one of the temples; Blood Tiger attributed his skill to growing up on the streets and killing his first man years before he Exalted. After his controversial retirement in RY 701, Blood Tiger disappeared. Over the next several years, some Dragon-Blooded prone to street fighting and brawling began to display battle techniques strangely reminiscent of the missing champion. Some suggest that Seven and Sixty Techniques of Deadly Breath, a manual of formalized informal combat that circulated during that time, was authored by him.
   Today, warriors can learn First Pulse Style at any time and place. Masters of the style naturally frequent the streets and alleys of the Threshold's cities. When they see a promising, self-trained brawler, they induct him into the mysteries of the style. Training comes in fits and bursts. After the first few days of lessons, the teacher disappears and returns to her normal habits. The student must impress her, or another master of the style, with her fighting techniques again to learn more.First Pulse techniques are all about fast reaction and spur-of-the-moment beatings. If you wait more than one heartbeat before attacking, they say, you've already lost. Air-aspected Dragon-Bloods have the sudden impulses and quick wits beneficial to practicing this style. They pay no elemental surcharge when using the Charms of this style.
   Weapons and Armor: A student learns to treat anything and everything within reach as a well-made weapon. Therefore, all improvised weapons are this style's form weapons. Consider a weapon "improvised" if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2 and, more importantly, if the character picks it up on the spur of the moment. The style may also be used with the cestus or the iron boot (or their artifact equivalents).
   Some First Pulse Stylists enjoy especially dirty infighting and arm themselves with axe-bladed shoes or thumb-mounted blades for eye-gouging. Axe-bladed shoes make kicks in037 ict lethal damage. Using eye-gougers requires the wearer to take control of a clinch. Getting into position to use the thumb-blades applies a -2 external penalty to the clinch attack or the opposed grappling check. When successful, the attacker may choose to inflict one level of lethal damage in lieu of any other harm, blinding the target in one eye (usually permanently), in a natural effect with the Crippling keyword. Many street fighters believe that Blood Tiger invented these weapons himself, however unlikely that might be. Warriors who fight in this style don't wear armor - it takes too much forethought to put on - though they could use these Charms in light armor should they be wearing it.</description>

        <description>When living on the streets, it's wise to stay in a combative mindset. This Charm allows a character to react with blinding speed to a surprise attack or ambush - a tactic most street brawlers know only too well. Apply half of the character's normal DVs to unexpected attacks, and add four dice to the subsequent Join Battle action.</description>

        <description>Canny street fighters often choose to get the drop on their enemies, especially in situations where they know they are going to come to blows. The character shifts from an apparently comfortable stance into the memory-blurring speed of combat in a startling instant. Using this Charm triggers a Join Battle action from everyone nearby, except for those who distinctly choose not to get involved, but the character's great speed means he attacks on tick 0. The player doesn't have to roll. The other players roll to see how fast their characters react to the sudden outbreak of violence. If some other character starts the fight, the player merely adds a number of dice equal to his Essence to his character's Join Battle roll.</description>

        <description>Once in combat, any urchin knows that it's better to give than to receive. Characters who master this Charm learn how to use an opponent's preparation to strike against him. When the martial artist is in range of a valid target, she may invoke this Charm and attack that target one tick earlier than her previous action's Speed should allow. (Doing so effectively reduces the Speed of her previous action by one). Such speed must come from somewhere, though, so the Charm adds one to the Speed of the attack or flurry she takes using this Charm.
   Example: The Dragon-Blooded martial artist Alley Thunder is participating in an all-out street brawl with a gang of thugs. The nearest thug to him is some distance away down the street, however, so the player decides Alley Thunder should perform a Dash action before he can throw his first punch. The Speed of a Dash action is 3, and the Speed of throwing a punch is 5. Thunder takes his Dash action (which puts his first victim in range as a valid target) then activates the Charm. As a result, he can throw his first punch on this third tick, rather than waiting for the fourth tick. Throwing the punch under these conditions takes six ticks instead of the standard five, however.
   Additionally, the character's DV does not refresh after the action she takes using this Charm, creating a weakness that others might exploit. (In the example, Alley Thunder's DVs refresh after his Dash action, but they do not refresh after the subsequent attack. They refresh after the action he takes after the attack). Even though the player technically has the character activate Hunter Bags the Deer before the action that the Charm affects, the use of the Charm counts as her Charm use for the action so affected. (Naturally, this restriction does not apply to Dragon-Blooded characters, since the Charm is reflexive). A character cannot use this Charm more than once between consecutive actions.</description>

        <description>One of the best things a back-alley warrior can do when attacked from surprise is to whip the attacker out of hiding, especially when she can toss him into a circle of her friends. When someone successfully hits a First Pulse practitioner with an unexpected attack, she may activate this Charm as the attacker inflicts damage. She gets an automatic clinch counterattack with her full ([Strength or Dexterity] + Martial Arts) dice pool. If successful, the martial artist automatically breaks the hold by throwing him either to the ground (prone) or across a distance equal to her Strength in yards in any direction. (See "Grappling" on p. 157 of Exalted). Her aggressor also suffers a -2 internal penalty to any attempts to return to hiding for the martial artist's next two actions.
   By spending two additional motes, the First Pulse Stylist may instead strike back with a deadly blow as soon as she feels a violent touch, contusing organs or cracking bones. She might be a little high-strung, but she'll have the reputation she wants. Rather than a clinch and throw, the martial artist applies a counterattack at her full dice pool against her aggressor. If the character would inflict bashing damage with this counterattack, she instead inflicts lethal. If her weaponry (or another Charm) allows her to strike with lethal force, she adds +3L to the blow's raw damage. She does not gain the counter-stealth benefits when using this version of the Charm, which is known as Kicking the Black Wolfhound.
   As usual for counterattacks, either form of this Charm reduces the character's DVs by one for the rest of her action.</description>

   According to legend, First Pulse Style began with the infamous Nexus pit fighter known by the stage name Blood Tiger. Rumors attributed his skill in the arena to Immaculate training that he received before fleeing one of the temples; Blood Tiger attributed his skill to growing up on the streets and killing his first man years before he Exalted. After his controversial retirement in RY 701, Blood Tiger disappeared. Over the next several years, some Dragon-Blooded prone to street fighting and brawling began to display battle techniques strangely reminiscent of the missing champion. Some suggest that Seven and Sixty Techniques of Deadly Breath, a manual of formalized informal combat that circulated during that time, was authored by him.
   Today, warriors can learn First Pulse Style at any time and place. Masters of the style naturally frequent the streets and alleys of the Threshold's cities. When they see a promising, self-trained brawler, they induct him into the mysteries of the style. Training comes in fits and bursts. After the first few days of lessons, the teacher disappears and returns to her normal habits. The student must impress her, or another master of the style, with her fighting techniques again to learn more.First Pulse techniques are all about fast reaction and spur-of-the-moment beatings. If you wait more than one heartbeat before attacking, they say, you've already lost. Air-aspected Dragon-Bloods have the sudden impulses and quick wits beneficial to practicing this style. They pay no elemental surcharge when using the Charms of this style.
   Weapons and Armor: A student learns to treat anything and everything within reach as a well-made weapon. Therefore, all improvised weapons are this style's form weapons. Consider a weapon "improvised" if it has a maximum Accuracy of -3 and a maximum Rate of 2 and, more importantly, if the character picks it up on the spur of the moment. The style may also be used with the cestus or the iron boot (or their artifact equivalents).
   Some First Pulse Stylists enjoy especially dirty infighting and arm themselves with axe-bladed shoes or thumb-mounted blades for eye-gouging. Axe-bladed shoes make kicks in037 ict lethal damage. Using eye-gougers requires the wearer to take control of a clinch. Getting into position to use the thumb-blades applies a -2 external penalty to the clinch attack or the opposed grappling check. When successful, the attacker may choose to inflict one level of lethal damage in lieu of any other harm, blinding the target in one eye (usually permanently), in a natural effect with the Crippling keyword. Many street fighters believe that Blood Tiger invented these weapons himself, however unlikely that might be. Warriors who fight in this style don't wear armor - it takes too much forethought to put on - though they could use these Charms in light armor should they be wearing it.</description>

        <description>It is always an advantage to throw your opponent off guard. Slow reactions in a deadly conflict show a lack of focus, but making someone else react slowly - that's skill. When the character hits a person with a Martial Arts attack while using this Charm, his target's player rolls (Wits + Awareness) against a difficulty equal to the character's Martial Arts rating. If the roll fails, the martial artist's attack delays his target's next action by a single tick, effectively increasing the Speed of her present action by one. Used cleverly, this technique can provide valuable gaps in opponents' defenses.</description>

        <description>First Pulse Style prizes action and despises hesitation. If the character manages to activate this Form-type Charm and still be the first to attack in a fight, his first attack's roll gains two automatic successes to hit and inflicts piercing damage. Whether or not he gets this edge, the character reduces the Speed of his attacks and any flurries that consist entirely of attacks by one, to a minimum of 4, for the rest of the scene. He also gains a two-die bonus to all attacks, but the Guard action becomes a -1 DV action for him.</description>

        <description>Brawlers don't spar in dojos, and they don't meet on fields of honor. They track down their enemies in the streets and give them lasting gifts of pain, or they are tracked down themselves. It might seem like a despicable and undesirable life, but for some, nothing else is living. Street fighters don't always want to give their opponents more than a couple of weeks' discomfort, but some unpleasant souls out there take things more personally and require lifelong lessons.
   This Charm can supplement a normal Martial Arts strike, a crush attack in a clinch or an opposed grappling check. If the attack successfully knocks the character's target prone (either through knockdown or by throwing the opponent to the ground), the character immediately brings a stone-hard foot down on a brittle piece of her target's anatomy. She inflicts (Strength + Essence) dice of lethal damage, and if her target suffers at least one level of damage, she has crippled him.
   What part of the body the character cripples depends on her whim and how much damage she inflicts. With one level of damage, she may crush and maim a hand or foot. Two levels of damage allow her to irreparably shatter an arm or leg. Three or more let her mangle the target's spine. She may always opt to inflict a lesser punishment. Those who use this Charm as a punishment (for wayward gang members, for instance) often match an injury to an indiscretion. Fighters who are just watching out for their own backs go for maximum damage. This sort of damage causes an appropriate penalty to actions with the injured limb, generally a -2 penalty to relevant physical actions. (See Exalted p. 152 for more ideas and rules on disabling injuries).</description>

Count only half of the target's Dodge DV against this attack (it cannot be parried).

        <description>A master of First Pulse Style knows the streets. She has lived on them and slept on them, eaten off them, breathed them. The streets are her domain, and she is equally at home on the back streets of the Imperial City, in the oldest and worst districts of Nexus or surrounded by the celestial slums of Yu-Shan. All such places are alike, in spirit if not appearance, and the master has taken the thousand hard lessons she learned there and internalized them.
   Activating this Charm, the character adds one to her Strength, Dexterity and Stamina for the duration of the scene. Her Wits score increases by three. She appears at least a foot taller, menacing, rough, deadly. Her hands drip blood - her blood and that of every tough she has made bleed during her period as a student of this style - and it flicks everywhere with her blows and parries. When people suffer knockback from her attacks, they travel twice as far, and it is the same when she throws them. She adds two yards to her Move and Dash actions and moves with the speed of death on the streets. While this Charm is active, First Pulse Form can reduce attack Speeds to a minimum of 3.</description>

            <name>Golden Janissary Style</name>
            <description>Warriors across Creation use Golden Janissary Style to combat creatures of darkness. When shades grow unruly and when the dead march, students of this art array themselves against the Underworld. Should the Yozi Cecelyne taste the sandy shores of the South and spew forth her demon children, the Golden Janissaries are ready. Several schools in each direction dedicate themselves to the ancient style, and each school has a master who demands equal devotion to the martial lifestyle.
   As shadowlands bloom in all lands without discrimination, the master instructors of Golden Janissary Style now recruit aggressively. They reduce their students' access to the outside world, the better to focus their minds and accelerate their training. Walks through the shadowlands and dream-stones of trips to Malfeas sensitize warriors to the presence and the methods of their many enemies. They study the construction and weaknesses of many undead monstrosities and similarly learn the natures and bans of myriad demon-spawn. The Golden Janissary schools combine such study with an unrelenting practice of martial forms, maneuvers and tactics that make them formidable obstacles for the enemies of Creation. But so few Dragon-Bloods out in the Threshold choose the Golden Janissary training...
   This style has even fewer adherents in regions where the Immaculate Order has a powerful grip. Monastic warriors of the Order often resent the intrusion of a secular school in the war against fell creatures. Where the Order has little influence, martial artists of this style work with the Immaculates or, more likely, conflict with them. Such conflicts rarely end well for the secular warriors, since their style concentrates on fighting the unnatural instead of Creation's proper denizens. Some Golden Janissary attacks also manifest a golden fire the Immaculates find... suspicious.
   Fire-aspected Dragon-Blooded, as well as Water Aspects, can wield the Charms of this style without paying a mote surcharge.
   Weapons and Armor: Golden Janissary Style treats spears and dire lances as form weapons. The style can be used while wearing light armor or no armor.</description>

            <name>Golden Janissary Style</name>
            <description>Warriors across Creation use Golden Janissary Style to combat creatures of darkness. When shades grow unruly and when the dead march, students of this art array themselves against the Underworld. Should the Yozi Cecelyne taste the sandy shores of the South and spew forth her demon children, the Golden Janissaries are ready. Several schools in each direction dedicate themselves to the ancient style, and each school has a master who demands equal devotion to the martial lifestyle.
   As shadowlands bloom in all lands without discrimination, the master instructors of Golden Janissary Style now recruit aggressively. They reduce their students' access to the outside world, the better to focus their minds and accelerate their training. Walks through the shadowlands and dream-stones of trips to Malfeas sensitize warriors to the presence and the methods of their many enemies. They study the construction and weaknesses of many undead monstrosities and similarly learn the natures and bans of myriad demon-spawn. The Golden Janissary schools combine such study with an unrelenting practice of martial forms, maneuvers and tactics that make them formidable obstacles for the enemies of Creation. But so few Dragon-Bloods out in the Threshold choose the Golden Janissary training...
   This style has even fewer adherents in regions where the Immaculate Order has a powerful grip. Monastic warriors of the Order often resent the intrusion of a secular school in the war against fell creatures. Where the Order has little influence, martial artists of this style work with the Immaculates or, more likely, conflict with them. Such conflicts rarely end well for the secular warriors, since their style concentrates on fighting the unnatural instead of Creation's proper denizens. Some Golden Janissary attacks also manifest a golden fire the Immaculates find... suspicious.
   Fire-aspected Dragon-Blooded, as well as Water Aspects, can wield the Charms of this style without paying a mote surcharge.
   Weapons and Armor: Golden Janissary Style treats spears and dire lances as form weapons. The style can be used while wearing light armor or no armor.</description>

        <description>No foe foreign to Creation can stand before the might of a Golden Janissary. Blows supplemented by this Charm clearly have the martial artist's full strength behind them. The player of any creature of darkness struck with this attack must roll to prevent that creature's knockdown. If the attack inflicts enough raw damage to cause knockdown normally, the roll's difficulty increases by two.
   Against any target, the attack need only inflict a number of levels of damage equal to the target's (Stamina - 1) to make the creature risk becoming stunned. The difficulty to resist being stunned is equal to either the attacker's Essence or (the damage inflicted - the target's Stamina) - whichever is higher.</description>

        <description>Defenders of Creation must have some method for discerning who is and who is not a foe. After all, the techniques of a Golden Janissary have little effect against creatures born in the light. Their training gives them the knowledge necessary to sense the flow of Essence through a body and know whether that creature belongs in Creation.
   Once activated, this Charm allows the martial artist to detect at a touch whether or not her special combat skills will affect a given target (i.e., whether a target is a creature of darkness). Merely touching a creature is enough to make a judgment, though an attack of some kind is necessary when the target tries not to be touched (almost always during battle). Against creatures using appropriate supernatural deception, the character adds her Essence in dice to the (Perception + Investigation) roll to oppose that effect. The martial artist must touch the target with an unarmed strike (not a weapon - even a form weapon) in order to use this Charm.</description>

        <description>A martial artist who practices the Golden Janissary Style moves with billowing, sweeping cuts and blows like a spreading blaze, always toward the fuel of his enemy. Although his attacks look somewhat wild, his actions are actually executed with enviable precision and skill, making him no easier to evade.
   For the Charm's duration, the janissary's player treats rolls of 10 on a damage die as two damage successes against creatures of darkness. Additionally, the warrior can spend one mote reflexively in Step 7 of attack resolution to reduce the damage from any attack against him by two dice, to a minimum of one. Using this technique against creatures of darkness reduces the damage by five dice instead, to a minimum damage of zero.</description>

        <description>Shadow grows weak when it enters the light. Warriors using this Charm summon their inner light and use it to protect themselves from their strange enemies. Once activated, Light-on-Dark Shield adds the martial artist's Essence to his Parry DV and his bashing and lethal soaks against attacks from creatures of darkness. Against other foes, his Parry DV and soak values increase by only one.
   At his option, the martial artist can spend a point of Willpower to share this protection with his allies. A halo of shimmering, fiery light forms around the warrior and leaps to his companions, making the Charm Obvious. He can aid no more than (Essence + 1) friends, and each one the warrior wishes to shield costs an additional two motes.</description>

        <description>Fire and light banish many creatures of darkness. How much greater their suffering if the fire comes from within them? By supplementing a Martial Arts attack with a powerful surge of Essence, a Golden Janissary sets the chakras in her enemy burning with spiritual fire.
   The attack does not need to inflict any damage past the target's soak, but it is more effective when it does. Bursts of fiery, golden light erupt from various points on the body of a creature struck by this attack, one flare each tick, with a sound like the ringing of golden bells. Characters trying to locate a victim of this Charm add two dice to all relevant attempts. Creatures of darkness under this effect also suffer a -1 internal penalty to all actions, plus an additional point of penalty for each health level of damage the attack inflicts. No Golden Janissary can impose a greater penalty than her Essence rating. Additional uses of this Charm against an affected target (by either the same martial artist or separate ones) do not increase the dice pool bonuses to locate that target or the frequency of the bursts of golden light that emanate from the target. The penalties inflicted on creatures of darkness are not cumulative either. Penalties are based on the supplemented attack that inflicted the most damage. They last until the end of the scene or until the associated wounds all heal, whichever comes first.
   Example: Jade-and-Silver Austrech uses this Charm to supplement an attack that inflicts one level of damage and causes a -2 penalty. A later use of the Charm on the same target that inflicts no damage has no additional effect. If that use had inflicted two levels of damage, the victim would then suffer a -3 penalty for the duration.
   Creatures of darkness who suffer a penalty from this Charm that is greater than their Essence suffer an equal penalty to the Speed of their Move and Dash actions.</description>

        <description>Surrounded by evil and darkness, masters of the Golden Janissary Style use this pinnacle technique to blast fields clean of their enemies and let light once again shine on the ground. With a massive blow of his hand or spear, the warrior's weapon flares for a brief moment with brilliant, golden-white flame. In all eyes, including that of Heaven, the afterimage floats on the victim for a long moment before the target creature - and creatures near it - bursts into purifying flame.
   The white-flaming fist or spearhead strike sears any opponent, adding +3L to the attack's raw damage. When used against a creature of darkness, it inflicts +6L instead of +3L. On the next tick, the creature of darkness bursts into flame and suffers a number of dice of aggravated damage equal to the martial artist's Essence, which ignores armor. At the same moment, all creatures of darkness with the same affiliation (i.e., the Underworld, Malfeas, Fair Folk or whatever) within (Essence x 3) yards find themselves at the center of similar pyres. These flames are ghostly and transparent and inflict no damage unless the Exalt chooses, at that moment, to spend one mote for each bonfire he wishes to endow with his holy power. On that action, immolated creatures suffer the same damage as the original creature.
   True fires inflict damage once more on the martial artist's next action and then dim into false flames. The ghostly bonfires disappear one action after that.</description>

            <name>Ill Lily Style</name>
            <description>Like the poison made from the rare Scarlet Caldera Lily, this martial-arts style rarely kills its foes directly. It serves instead to weaken them, striking from many different angles to keep its victims on their feet while wearing them down from within and without. Its toxic associations give the style a bad reputation, though. People tend to assume that students of this fighting art are as shifty and dishonorable as any poisoner. Actually, teachers of the Ill Lily Style advocate facing foes directly... while hitting them from the side.
   Although known in the East, the influential Dragon-Blooded of Lookshy frown upon the Ill Lily Style, and they sometimes show their disapproval with gunzosha. The schools that teach the style in the Scavenger Lands operate mostly in secret or are actually criminal. Ill Lily Style is more common in the South, where some sand-buried tubers can be pressed to release an effective paralytic, and where the Scarlet Caldera Lily itself grows.
   Wood Aspects share an elemental association with this style, so neither they nor Water Aspects pay an elemental surcharge when using Charms from this style.
   Weapons and Armor: Exalts studying this style learn how to use any sort of small wooden weapon as a part of the style. Some use lengths of rough, unplaned wood, while others prefer to use wooden practice swords for their tools. For the purpose of traits, treat wooden weapons as clubs. As long as they are made completely from wood, all of these weapons serve as form weapons for Ill Lily Style. Artifact batons may be used with this style if they contain no magical material other than green jade. Students of this style may also throw these batons with the Martial Arts Ability. This style is compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>Some plants produce a lotion that can soothe and soften the skin. Wood-aspected martial artists imitate that in this Charm, using their Essence to smooth the path their blows take through their opponents' armor.
   Each mote spent on this Charm reduces the effectiveness of a foe's armor by one bashing soak; two motes remove one point of lethal soak. The Exalt can spend no more motes on this Charm than he has dots in Martial Arts. In order for this Charm to take effect, the martial artist must first land a successful attack to lubricate a path for his future blows to follow. This initial attack inflicts no damage. Otherwise, for each success by which he surpassed his target's DV, he gains the benefits of this Charm against that opponent for one action.
   Only the Exalt who uses this Charm benefits from its effects. The softening Essence-trail is available only to the martial artist who creates it.</description>

            <name>Ill Lily Style</name>
            <description>Like the poison made from the rare Scarlet Caldera Lily, this martial-arts style rarely kills its foes directly. It serves instead to weaken them, striking from many different angles to keep its victims on their feet while wearing them down from within and without. Its toxic associations give the style a bad reputation, though. People tend to assume that students of this fighting art are as shifty and dishonorable as any poisoner. Actually, teachers of the Ill Lily Style advocate facing foes directly... while hitting them from the side.
   Although known in the East, the influential Dragon-Blooded of Lookshy frown upon the Ill Lily Style, and they sometimes show their disapproval with gunzosha. The schools that teach the style in the Scavenger Lands operate mostly in secret or are actually criminal. Ill Lily Style is more common in the South, where some sand-buried tubers can be pressed to release an effective paralytic, and where the Scarlet Caldera Lily itself grows.
   Wood Aspects share an elemental association with this style, so neither they nor Water Aspects pay an elemental surcharge when using Charms from this style.
   Weapons and Armor: Exalts studying this style learn how to use any sort of small wooden weapon as a part of the style. Some use lengths of rough, unplaned wood, while others prefer to use wooden practice swords for their tools. For the purpose of traits, treat wooden weapons as clubs. As long as they are made completely from wood, all of these weapons serve as form weapons for Ill Lily Style. Artifact batons may be used with this style if they contain no magical material other than green jade. Students of this style may also throw these batons with the Martial Arts Ability. This style is compatible with armor.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, poison can be made to flow through wood as easily as through blood. By touching a single dose of a plant-based toxin to her wooden weapon, the Exalt enables herself to transfer that poison to another through a blow from the stick. The poison becomes transferable by contact, even if that is not normally possible.
   If the martial artist successfully strikes a living creature with the tainted weapon, the target suffers the effects of the poison. The attack must either inflict damage or be a called shot (see Exalted, p. 158) to dramatically scrape the target's skin without inflicting damage. Doing so effectively discharges the poison. To use the stick or club as a conduit for this toxin (or another) again, she must expend another dose on the stick. Since the poison need only touch the weapon, doing so requires nothing more than a -1 DV miscellaneous action when in combat.
   This Charm works using only plant-based toxins that normally take effect through ingestion, contact or direct injection to the bloodstream. Toxins must be fully prepared before application to the cudgel. The Charm cannot employ a poison that must be used in a special way (such as marijuana, which must be burned and smoked).
   A Wood-aspected Dragon-Blooded has an advantage in this respect. By activating her anima and holding her weapon in bare hands, she can keep her natural toxin constantly flowing into the weapon. If she so chooses, however, she can subdue her anima long enough to place another appropriate poison of her choice on the weapon.Should the martial artist lose hold of her weapon and not regain it on her next action, this Charm expires.</description>

        <description>By appearing vulnerable, the Exalt lures his opponent into overextending herself. When attacked, the martial artist activates this Charm and tries to dodge or parry the blow. If the attack fails, then the martial artist has maneu-vered himself into a position to drive a strike home on his next action. His opponent suffers a cumulative -1 penalty from her DV for each mote the Exalt spent (up to half the character's Martial Arts, rounded up), but only against the character who used the Charm and only if the martial artist uses his next action to attack her.</description>

        <description>The martial artist can hurl twigs with concussive force and nimbly swing logs to crush her enemies. When an Exalt supplements an attack with this Charm, she can use any wooden object that she can lift as an effective weapon. It must be light enough that she can lift it, and there is no guarantee the weapon will survive the attack -flimsy sticks tend to pierce the skin and break, while overlarge weapons rarely have the structural integrity to withstand a solid blow. Any raw damage the weapon inflicts also affects the weapon itself, and in equal measure.
   Unorthodox weapons used with this Charm - as most are - take on the effective statistics of a wooden club and can be used in melee or ranged combat as normal. At Essence 3 or higher, the Exalt can spend one extra mote to add +2 to the weapon's Accuracy.
   "Weapons" bound to other objects - a heavy plank in a large gate or a tree growing from the ground - are not automatically ripped from their moorings by this Charm. Even if the martial artist can perform such a feat of strength, she must spend an action to do so.</description>

        <description>Placing one foot behind him and one palm above his head, open to the sky, the Exalt assumes the Ill Lily Form. His actions are deliberate but fluid, like grass or leaves in a soft breeze.
   For the rest of the scene, the martial artist adds his Essence to his bashing soak and half his Essence to any Martial Arts attacks performed unarmed or with the style's form weapons. Additionally, he may spend a mote and a miscellaneous action (-1 DV) to touch one dose of a plant-based toxin and empower it, increasing its Toxicity by an amount equal to his Essence.
   If the poison is already absorbed into the Exalt's wooden weapon through use of Veins of Wood, increasing its potency is a reflexive action instead. Similarly, a Wood Aspect's enhancing his natural toxin is reflexive and lasts until either he discharges it once or the scene ends.</description>

        <description>The martial artist's body shines with a halo of energy as his anima flares around him, tinged with a vibrant, lively green. A Wood Aspect's anima banner flares at the 16+ mote level, inflicting one die of lethal damage to anyone in contact with him, and he gains the benefit of his anima power until his next action ends.
   Sending his awareness to mingle with the Wood Essence of his surroundings, the Exalt takes control of a nearby (otherwise inanimate) plant and directs it to attack on his behalf. The target of this attack must be within (Essence x 5) yards and must be no more than five yards from a plant capable of executing this attack. Since the attack does not come from the martial artist, but from a plant of his choosing, the victim of the assault has no opportunity to dodge or parry - it is an unexpected attack. Even those who have fought a master of Ill Lily Style before cannot necessarily discern whence the attack will come. Only Charms (or other magical effects) that defeat surprise or that can be used against unexpected attacks offer any protection (unless there really is only one possible source, such as a lone potted palm inside a building, and it isn't the first attack made with this Charm against a target).
   At the Storyteller's discretion, some kinds of vegetation can receive bonuses to certain attacks. Vines are excellent grapplers, for instance, while most trees perform excellent hard strikes. Otherwise, the attacks are exactly as though the martial artist grappled barehanded or struck with a wooden baton. Grappled victims must use an action to free themselves from the still-animate plant after the normal five ticks of helplessness.
   For a moment, the Exalt also gains a glimpse into all living Essence within his range. He instantly knows where every living thing is, whether hiding or not (unless concealed by Essence), and their general state of health and temperament. Knowing where a person is hiding nearby does not necessarily let the martial artist see her, however, and if the other person moves to hide somewhere else, the martial artist loses his advantage.
       Most Exalts who master this style use World-Focus Attunement as a superior meditative technique. They typically become remarkable gardeners as well as martial artists.</description>

            <description>The Imperial Mountain is the center of the Realm, the elemental pole that signifies stability and holds Creation together. Jade Mountain Style captures that stability and inner strength to create a martial art with which one can stand strong against any assault.
   Although the "feel" of Jade Mountain Style somewhat resembles Earth Dragon Style (see The Manual of Exalted Power: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 201-205), this secular style is less powerful than the Immaculate art. Some monks interpret the Immaculate Texts to suggest that Jade Mountain Style is a false path to emulating Pasiap, so few schools on the Blessed Isle teach it. Jade Mountain practitioners are more commonly found among the Dragon-Blooded of Lookshy and other outcastes.
   Earth-aspected Dragon-Bloods may practice this style's Charms without paying an elemental surcharge of Essence. Additionally, the Charms of Jade Mountain Style function only while the practitioner is in a stable position. Practitioners prefer to stand on solid ground, but any tenable position will do. If the martial artist is easily upset - swimming, standing on a small raft, flying, jumping, balancing on bamboo or the like - he may not activate or use these Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Jade Mountain Style considers clubs, hammers, maces, sledges and goremauls form weapons, and it may be practiced in armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Characters require no other Abilities to learn Jade Mountain Style, but practitioners often develop their Resistance to a remarkable degree.</description>

When this Charm supplements a successful clinch attack or opposed clinch roll, all crushing damage inflicted by the martial artist becomes lethal. The damage she inflicts continues to be lethal until the clinch is broken.
   Out of combat, a Jade Mountain Style practitioner can use this Charm to afflict his social foes with bone-grinding handshakes, adding one success to a relevant roll, if appropriate.</description>

Additionally, the Charms of Jade Mountain Style function only while the practitioner is in a stable position. Practitioners prefer to stand on solid ground, but any tenable position will do. If the martial artist is easily upset - swimming, standing on a small raft, flying, jumping, balancing on bamboo or the like - he may not activate or use these Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Jade Mountain Style considers clubs, hammers, maces, sledges and goremauls form weapons, and it may be practiced in armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Characters require no other Abilities to learn Jade Mountain Style, but practitioners often develop their Resistance to a remarkable degree.</description>

        <description>The Exalt shifts his position and changes his grasp with his opponent, making sure that she cannot escape their deadly embrace. When the martial artist's player loses an opposed clinch roll (i.e., the two characters are already in a clinch), his opponent still cannot break the hold. Held by his unavoidable grip, the opponent must either crush him for damage or hold him peacefully.</description>

        <description>By letting her Essence flow into the ground, the Exalt anchors herself. So strong is her connection to the earth beneath her, she cannot be moved. For one mote, she may ignore any single, non-magical effect that would incur knockdown, knockback or otherwise move her.
   If a Charm or other magic inflicts such an effect, the martial artist must spend motes equal to the attacker's Essence, and this Charm does not function if that attacker has a greater permanent Essence than the character.</description>

        <description>After stomping both feet firmly into the ground beneath him, the martial artist's actions slow as his skin visibly hardens and takes on the aspect of stone. For every three motes spent, the Exalt adds one to both his bashing and lethal soak and ignores fatigue penalties for the rest of the scene. There is no limit on how many motes he may spend on a single activation of this Charm.
       Martial artists practicing this technique, which is deliberately slow, suffer a -2 Dodge DV penalty without appropriate magic. This Charm ends immediately if the Exalt completely breaks contact with the earth or moves more than a yard from his original position. For this reason, Jade Mountain Style practitioners use Pillar of Marble Stance to resist knockback and other such effects.</description>

        <description>The earth around the master of Jade Mountain Style shivers, as she briefly falls to one knee and touches her head to the ground. Rising from the meditative position, she reveals the great strength and might of the mountain within her - this Charm adds almost a foot to her height and 100 pounds to her weight.
       More stunning are the plates of stone that rip themselves from the earth around her. They lock into place around the martial artist's body, giving her an external musculature to use in battle. The transformation from Exalt to stone juggernaut adds an amount equal to her Essence to her Strength and Stamina. It also allows her to soak lethal with her full (and improved) Stamina and parry lethal attacks unarmed without a stunt.
   Although it is powerful, the mountain is neither agile nor quick. Jade Mountain Form reduces an Exalt's Dexterity (and corresponding movement rate) by one dot.Should the martial artist lose contact with the earth for more than one whole action, the Charm ends. That is, a Jade Mountain practitioner can leap from the ground on her action, but as long as she lands before or on her next action, she maintains the Charm. If someone grapples her and lifts her from the ground for five ticks, she must take control of the grapple in the next action and escape to the ground, or Jade Mountain Form ends.</description>

        <description>When struck by a weapon, the master of Jade Mountain Style can transfer the wound directly through his body into the ground beneath his feet. By tensing the muscles leading from the point of harm to his legs, and from his legs to his feet, supplemented by Essence, he channels the impact or cut from the blow into the earth. A white flash of Essence traces out the wound's path to the ground.
   For every mote spent, the Exalt can redirect two dice of bashing damage or one of lethal, before the dice are rolled. He can reduce damage to zero dice if he spends enough Essence. If not, any damage left over affects him normally. Damage shunted to the ground inflicts one level of bashing or lethal (as appropriate) on the ground for each die affected by the Charm. In fields or on stone floors, this has little effect beyond superficial damage as the stone cracks and soft earth tears and craters. The damage can become significantly more inconvenient for the martial artist if the floor breaks in locations such as a ledge, an iced-over lake or a wooden second story.</description>

        <description>Most Jade Mountain martial artists have considerable weight, but even the slight ones learn how to apply their mass with tremendous leverage. Just like the avalanche, the Exalt can trap her opponent beneath her weight and weary him until he succumbs.
   This Charm supplements a clinch attack or an opposed clinch roll and doubles the Exalt's raw damage before soak. If the crushing inflicts more damage than the victim's (current) Stamina, the victim temporarily loses one point of Stamina. Victims reduced to zero Stamina by this Charm fall unconscious. Lost Stamina returns at a rate of one dot per scene.</description>

            <description>The Night Breeze Style is a lesser brother of the Air Dragon Style practiced by Immaculate monks (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Dragon-Blooded, pp. 197-201). It might also have drawn inspiration from the long-forgotten Ebon Shadow Style (see pp. 91-94). Practitioners of the Night Breeze Style focus on secrecy, subtlety and silence more than their Immaculate cousins do. Where the Immaculates channel the fury of the storm, Night Breeze Style practitioners emphasize air's invisibility and the silent manner in which it infiltrates the most secure room.
   Exalted Dynasts value this style for its benefit in their politically minded (and occasionally assassination-minded) society. Night Breeze practitioners tend to keep their skills secret, as knowing that one's companion has the skills of an accomplished assassin can color one's perceptions of that individual. In some locations, such as Lookshy, this style is explicitly forbidden.
   Air-aspected Dragon-Bloods do not pay a one-mote elemental surcharge when practicing this style.
   Weapons and Armor: Night Breeze Charms treat all lightweight, thrown weapons such as chakrams, shuriken, knives, slings, kamas and sickles as form weapons, but throwing needles are most popular because they are so easy to hide. In addition, style Charms that are not, themselves, attacks (such as Leaf on the Breeze Rhythm) can be used while making any sort of attack. This style cannot be used while wearing armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Anyone who wants to learn Night Breeze Style must already possess at least two dots in Thrown.</description>

   Each mote spent on this Charm eliminates one point of external penalty caused by cover or shields. The Exalt cannot spend more motes on this Charm than there are points of external penalties from those sources.</description>

        <description>Students of the Night Breeze school have some measure of mastery over the art of concealment. This Charm allows the Exalt to spin and weave in combat like a wind-tossed leaf, moving so unpredictably as to escape his opponents' views.
   For the Charm's duration, the Exalt can attempt to reestablish surprise (as described in Exalted, p. 156) even if there are no places to hide or aids to concealment. If the martial artist could normally reestablish surprise, he adds one die to all attempts.</description>

            <description>The Night Breeze Style is a lesser brother of the Air Dragon Style practiced by Immaculate monks (see The Manual of Exalted Power - The Dragon-Blooded, pp. 197-201). It might also have drawn inspiration from the long-forgotten Ebon Shadow Style (see pp. 91-94). Practitioners of the Night Breeze Style focus on secrecy, subtlety and silence more than their Immaculate cousins do. Where the Immaculates channel the fury of the storm, Night Breeze Style practitioners emphasize air's invisibility and the silent manner in which it infiltrates the most secure room.
   Exalted Dynasts value this style for its benefit in their politically minded (and occasionally assassination-minded) society. Night Breeze practitioners tend to keep their skills secret, as knowing that one's companion has the skills of an accomplished assassin can color one's perceptions of that individual. In some locations, such as Lookshy, this style is explicitly forbidden.
   Air-aspected Dragon-Bloods do not pay a one-mote elemental surcharge when practicing this style.
   Weapons and Armor: Night Breeze Charms treat all lightweight, thrown weapons such as chakrams, shuriken, knives, slings, kamas and sickles as form weapons, but throwing needles are most popular because they are so easy to hide. In addition, style Charms that are not, themselves, attacks (such as Leaf on the Breeze Rhythm) can be used while making any sort of attack. This style cannot be used while wearing armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Anyone who wants to learn Night Breeze Style must already possess at least two dots in Thrown.</description>

        <description>Night Breeze Form is a light-footed method that helps a martial artist flow from here to there, seeming barely to touch the ground. More than that, a darkness settles around the martial artist, making it harder for her enemies to see her and easier for her to move securely.
   From a distance on a bright day, the magical shadows around the Exalt - which extend outward for (Essence x 3) yards - make her easy to notice, if not to see directly. Up close or at night, it is only an advantage. The darkness combines with the form's quiet steps to add the Exalt's Martial Arts to all Stealth rolls. The zone of shadow counts as poor visibility, equal to a moonless night in clear terrain (see Exalted, p. 135).</description>

        <description>Just as the cold wind sweeps out from above the warmer, rising air, the master of Night Breeze Style flows beneath and away from oncoming ranged attacks. As part of a dodge, the Exalt leaps backward a distance of up to (Martial Arts) yards. By spending additional Essence, she can leap farther. Each additional mote adds a number of yards equal to her Martial Arts to her leap. She cannot leap farther than (her Essence x Martial Arts) yards. If this movement takes the martial artist out of her attacker's current range increment (not necessarily completely out of range), the attack auto-matically misses.
   This Charm does not affect perfect attacks or ranged attacks that suffer no penalties for range.</description>

        <description>Taking up as many weapons as he can hold, the Exalt hurls all of them with a single motion. The storm of objects hurtles toward a single victim, who has an all-or-nothing chance to evade the attack. These objects may be anything, but most Night Breeze Stylists prefer to use their signature throwing needles, which are more accurate than random objects and easier to conceal in great numbers. (Yet, for this Charm only, the character can throw any small object, even if it isn't a proper weapon, as long is it weighs no more than a knife).
   The character can throw a number of objects equal to his Martial Arts, and his player applies a single attack roll to the entire collection. The victim may dodge them all as a single attack, but the hail of attacks is harder to parry. Apply onslaught penalties if the target elects to parry, subtracting one from her Parry DV for the second object, two for the third, and so on. Each weapon that hits inflicts its base damage only.</description>

        <description>The Exalt lightly flicks his hand, and his weapon hurtles toward his foe. Just before it strikes, the weapon dissolves into a swirling vortex of air that insinuates itself into the joints and cracks of the target's armor. As it works its way toward the victim's tender flesh, it recoalesces.
   This Charm makes any thrown-weapon attack piercing. Thrown attacks made with weapons that already inflict piercing damage instead evade armor altogether. Night Breeze practitioners use this Charm almost exclusively to let their throwing needles evade Hardness.</description>

        <description>Despite the tangle that rice wine and hashish can inflict upon his mind, the martial artist manages to correctly interpret the situation and react in an appropriate fashion. Whether his drunken fist needs to find a nose or his dilated pupils tell him when to duck, the character is not as hindered as his pleasantly induced state would normally make him. For one action, he may ignore all internal penalties deriving from drugs or sexual exhaustion. The penalties still count for any Charm that utilizes them (such as Saturnalia Memoriam Kick), but they do not detract from the character's dice pools.</description>

        <description>Having attended a pleasant party, there is joy in that memory, and there is strength in joy. Anyone who has tried to take a doll from a child or a bottle from an alley wino can attest to that. In the right mindset, a stiff drink or a good drug can bring those memories vividly to mind.
   As long as the dissolute character takes a shot of hard liquor or hit of the various other drugs as the first action in a flurry (diceless, -1 DV), she may supplement any attacks in the flurry with this Charm. Doing so lends joy to her blows, adding to her raw damage her Martial Arts score plus the penalty associated with the drug she just took. (Marijuana inflicts a -2 penalty on a character who uses it, for instance. Therefore, using the first action in a flurry to suck down a lungful of marijuana smoke, adds a two-die bonus - plus dice equal to her Martial Arts - to the raw damage of the attacks in the flurry). Students of this style haven't yet figured out how to perform this same technique using the joys of sex (maybe a coordinated attack of some sort..)., but that hasn't stopped them from trying.</description>

        <description>Dedicated revelers know how to pace themselves. They begin overindulging when they rise one morning and, careful to balance out the alcohol with the marijuana and qat and both of those with aerobic and/or marathon sex, can some-times prevent the party from ending for at least a fortnight. Moderation is the key to successful overindulgence.
       Reflexively, but no more than once per action, the character can use his overly drugged state to fuel his martial prowess, at the same time aiding in his effort to moderate his indulgences with other activities. For a scene after activating the Orgiastic Fugitive Form, he can reduce his total internal penalties from overindulgence by one and add one automatic success to any action or defense. The player chooses which of the character's many internal penalties he reduces by one.
   Additionally, as long as the character suffers internal penalties from at least three separate indulgences, he can selectively reduce the penalty from any one of them to a minimum of -1 internal penalty. The penalties are still there (and can still be used by Charms that rely on those penal-ties), but they don't apply negatively to his actions.
   Strictly speaking, the Orgiastic Fugitive Form applies only to combat actions. At the Storyteller's option, however, players can use this Charm as justification for a stunt involving any action: giving a speech in the Deliberative, deciphering code, figuring out a First Age artifact... The character's fizzing brain makes intuitive leaps denied to the sober, or trailing euphoria from a fantastic party gives him the nerve and verve to take greater chances for better results.</description>

        <description>Personal boundaries shiver and fall after dedicated carousing, and it is not uncommon for a party's escapees to forget that others aren't quite as relaxed. Uninhibited touching is the order of the day until the recipients point out that it is unwelcome. And sometimes even then. Activating this Charm, the character may make two clinches simultaneously, rather than having to seize two victims on consecutive actions. Each suffers a -5 multiple-action penalty, but the character may reduce the penalty of each separately, to a minimum of -2, for each point of penalty she suffers due to indulgence.</description>

            <description>Some supernatural martial arts demand ascetic discipline and meditative calm to refine and direct one's Essence. This is not one of them. Instead of being for staunch opponents of lust, gluttony, wrath and other important pastimes, this style is for those who indulge. Masters of this style use it to explore the depths of those most happy habits, wielding vices as weapons. The fugitive in the style's name is not running from a celebration that tempts him; he has just left one that successfully did.
   Those who learn this style do so under the influence of a multitude of mind-altering substances and meditative sex. Because of the understanding a warrior must have for fermentations of the grape and grains, the refinements of various plants and how two or more human bodies can intertwine, and the way these things can affect the body, Wood-aspected Dragon-Blooded take naturally to this style. They do not pay a mote surcharge when using these Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Practitioners of this style fight equally well with hookahs, opium pipes, ale bottles, heavy glasses and their harmonious fists. Treat any weapon they use as clubs or sticks for the purposes of statistics, depending on their heft, as form weapons. Martial artists cannot wear armor with the Charms of this style.</description>

        <description>Some partygoers are so very enthusiastic. Each and every vice seems attractive and pleasing, and it is all they can do to focus on enjoying one at a time. Others train themselves to surpass that necessity, chewing hashish while sipping a single malt and inhaling the ambient smoke that leaks from the hookahs. The reveling community values the skill to savor each delight separately when taken together.
   Activating this Charm gives the martial artist the ability to enjoy his combat the same way he enjoys his other vices - all at once. He may attempt a flurry of as many actions as he has points of internal penalty. The first suffers only a -1 penalty, the next -2, and so on. He does not suffer any penalties from overindulgence on these actions, which must either be attacks or attempts to indulge further in available vices.</description>

        <description>Despite the many influences slowing her thought, dulling her senses and scrambling the many, often urgent, messages her arms and legs send to her brain, the reveler knows exactly where she is and what she's doing. Or so she insists.
   The character's assailants, clear-headed and willing to let her walk into their blows, somehow miss her. Once they do, the weight and expectation they put behind the attack carries them forward and beyond her. On a successful dodge, the character may invoke this Charm to cause her attacker to take his full Move action past her (even if he has already moved this action). The character's simple explanation for this error in judgment is that she simply wasn't where her attacker thought she was. Clearly.</description>

        <description>Fate smiles on children and fools, and the fortunate reveler has aspects of both. The way he stumbles and bumbles around, evaluating walls as privies and pondering the hidden natures of everyday things, he should be a simple target. Unfortunately for his opponents, this uncoordinated nature protects him as he stops without warning or bends over to look at an interesting bug. Activating this Charm adds half the character's total penalties from indulgence to his Dodge DV against a single attack.</description>

        <description>After years and years of marathon orgies, the character might find that she can make her friends dizzy, sick or even high just by standing near them. Whether that's an accomplishment or a disgrace, the skillful martial artist finds a way to use anything to her advantage. Using her intimate understanding of the substances involved, she guides her Essence in capturing, refining and expelling the drugs and fatigue poisons in her body into a cloud of strongly drugged and bluish air that hovers about her for several long, dizzying seconds. Assuming the Unhealthy Miasma Stance, the character purges her body of up to (Martial Arts) indulgence penalties, from indulgences of her player's choice. For the Charm's duration, anyone within two yards of her suffers these penalties instead. Each action a character takes within that influence, his player must make a (Stamina + Resistance) roll at a difficulty equal to the character's Essence, or he suffers them for the rest of the scene. Actions that require close, extended contact with the Exalt (such as clinches) increase this difficulty by one.</description>

            <description>A few martial schools of the West teach this style. Students learn their enlightenment onboard ship. They seek the ability to roll with the ocean and react as fluidly as the water that buoys their ships. Seafaring Hero Style features rolling dodges, long flying kicks and entangling techniques. Since its genesis, the style has spread to Essence-channeling sailors throughout the seas of Creation. It is not difficult to find a practitioner among the Realm's navy, especially in the Water Fleet and in the V'neef-dominated merchant marine. Large non-imperial fleets, merchant or military, pay well for masters of this art. This style is a Water-aspected one.
   Weapons and Armor: Seafaring Hero Style treats chain and rope weapons as form weapons. Practitioners may also use slashing swords or short swords or their artifact versions. Hitting someone with a rope would normally do nothing more than abrade and annoy him, but Seafaring Heroes can easily improvise weighted ropes or rope darts using marlinespikes, ballast stones and other shipboard paraphernalia. Fighters practicing this style may not wear anything heavier than light armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Few martial artists learn this style who don't spend a lot of time on the ocean. As a result, many of them have at least a few dots in Sail, although this is not required. Those rare students of the art who learn this style on dry land practice it on an unbalanced two-wheeled cart that emulates the swaying of a ship at sea. The style's Charms may be used in any place, but they suffer a -1 internal penalty when practiced anywhere but aboard a ship at sea.</description>

        <description>All sailors know the danger of getting caught in the doldrums. Experienced sailors fear pirates less than sitting on the sea with no wind, or brief puffs from random directions, because it mixes boredom with bad company and dwindling supplies. Eventually, men go mad from entrapment on the becalmed sea. The martial artist using this Charm has meditated upon that experience, and she knows how to use its madness as a weapon. Her steps are unexpected, and her blows come from surprising quarters, making it more difficult to defend against the character's attack. Her target suffers a -2 penalty to his DV against this attack (-1 if he has three or more dots in Sail). Should the attack connect, it throws the target off balance and degrades his ability to move in his own defense. He then suffers the same penalty against all attacks in that tick. The attacker may not take a Move action in the same tick she uses this Charm.</description>

        <description>Skipping above the black depths, nothing can drown the sea spiders of the Coral Archipelago. They dance on the waves and pierce that blue veil only to kill their prey. After a shipwreck, clever islanders watch the spiders, waiting for their strong mandibles to catch and drag up the dead. Having learned the first mysteries of the style, a student can drag foes from the ship that carries him with the same mastery. Activating this Charm, the character "dips" into a battle on decks from above. As a single action, the character sweeps downward on a rope and makes a clinch attack against one target. He completes the motion by swinging back up into the rigging, generally with his victim. This action has a -2 DV penalty and allows the character to exceed the normal movement limits of the Move action.</description>

        <description>The rudder is half a ship's will, and it must be kept in good repair. Should it become warped or damaged, the crew loses control over how the ship moves. With some practice, students of this style learn how to inflict this same problem on others. The character supplements a clinch attack or an opposed grappling check with this Charm. If the attack succeeds, he must immediately release his opponent. For the duration of the Charm, the target can move in one only direction dictated by the martial artist. This direction must be absolute to the environment ("toward the aft, toward that door, that way"), not relative to the character ("away from me"). Targets may choose instead not to move at all.</description>

        <description>True Seafaring Heroes are greater than any mere storm or rolling deck. While on a ship, the martial artist ignores up to (Martial Arts) dice worth of penalty due to environmental factors. She also knows how to roll with attacks, much as a well-tended ship rolls over the waves of lesser storms. By voluntarily reducing her DV by one against a single attack, she can reduce the raw damage she suffers by three dice. She may not reduce her DV by an amount greater than her Essence.</description>

            <description>A few martial schools of the West teach this style. Students learn their enlightenment onboard ship. They seek the ability to roll with the ocean and react as fluidly as the water that buoys their ships. Seafaring Hero Style features rolling dodges, long flying kicks and entangling techniques. Since its genesis, the style has spread to Essence-channeling sailors throughout the seas of Creation. It is not difficult to find a practitioner among the Realm's navy, especially in the Water Fleet and in the V'neef-dominated merchant marine. Large non-imperial fleets, merchant or military, pay well for masters of this art. This style is a Water-aspected one.
   Weapons and Armor: Seafaring Hero Style treats chain and rope weapons as form weapons. Practitioners may also use slashing swords or short swords or their artifact versions. Hitting someone with a rope would normally do nothing more than abrade and annoy him, but Seafaring Heroes can easily improvise weighted ropes or rope darts using marlinespikes, ballast stones and other shipboard paraphernalia. Fighters practicing this style may not wear anything heavier than light armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Few martial artists learn this style who don't spend a lot of time on the ocean. As a result, many of them have at least a few dots in Sail, although this is not required. Those rare students of the art who learn this style on dry land practice it on an unbalanced two-wheeled cart that emulates the swaying of a ship at sea. The style's Charms may be used in any place, but they suffer a -1 internal penalty when practiced anywhere but aboard a ship at sea.</description>

        <description>Just as the ship that uses the most slaves for its ram-ming scuttles the most enemy ships, the warrior who strikes with the greatest speed lays his enemies low. The character moves up to (Dexterity + 6) yards before this attack, at least half of which he spends flying through the air with his foot extended. When he connects, he adds a number of dice equal to his Martial Arts to his raw damage and one die to his minimum damage. If his opponent successfully dodges, the hero must spend his next tick moving the same distance past his target. Attacking in this manner by swinging from the rigging adds another die to damage and increases the difficulty to resist knockdown to 4.</description>

        <description>Waves grow strong over time as the winds build them up. Over hundreds of leagues, they change from mere ripples to behemoths ready to tear ships to shreds. The most brilliant captains learn how to ride such waves, traveling incredibly quickly and getting the drop on their waterborne foes. The character emulates both the wave and the ship by building up her strength to unleash a massive blow on her target.
   When the character invokes this Charm, her player rolls (Strength + Martial Arts). Each success adds one to the raw damage of the attack the martial artist makes on her next action. Perceptive opponents might notice her marshaling her inner strength and collecting herself for a blow. Instead of attacking, a martial artist may use this Charm again and accumulate even more raw damage. Each subsequent use of this Charm subtracts two dice from the (Strength + Martial Arts) pool, and the character may not use this Charm when it provides zero dice. If her next action is not an attack or invoking this Charm, the Seafaring Hero loses its benefit.</description>

        <description>In ship-to-ship combat, one of the most effective tactics is to target an opponent's sails, rendering her ship dead in the water until her crew can repair the damage. While inflicting damage on an enemy with a Martial Arts attack, the Exalt makes sure that he retains the maneuver-ability advantage. Each health level of damage inflicted with this Charm reduces a target's Move and Dash actions by two yards, to a minimum of zero. Characters with a Move action of zero yards suffer a -2 internal penalty to their Dodge DVs.</description>

        <description>Sailors know no fury worse than the wind of a storm, which can topple a ship or tear its mast straight off. The best proof against such danger is to drop all sails, reducing the wind's grip as much as possible. Martial artists apply the same technique to their defenses. Dropping her arms to her sides and presenting as small a target as possible, blue-black winds of Essence howl past and around the character, causing attacks against her to miss. This Charm supplies a perfect defense against dodgeable ranged attacks that are not enhanced by stunts or Charms, and it adds three to the character's Dodge DV in any case. The Charm also grants this Dodge DV bonus against Melee and Martial Arts attacks.</description>

            <description>There is no White Veil Society. It is not cunningly concealed among the apparently carefree Dragon-Blooded socialites of the Realm, its satrapies and Lookshy. No one would suggest that its members have a political agenda within and beyond the Scarlet Empire. Nor would anyone believe, should it be whispered, that the White Veil Society collects vast sums of money and favors in order to further the goals that it doesn't have. Moreover, an organization that does not exist certainly cannot have the influence or talent pool to develop its own subtle, social martial arts style.
   White Veil Style does not combine common, everyday movements with potent manipulations of chakras and Essence lines in a devastating and nearly invisible manner. It isn't one of the White Veil Society's many sources of secret power. It never sees use at the recitals, dinners and orgies of the Dynasts. People do not die from it, occasionally silently and occasionally screaming, days or weeks after not encountering it.Students who are not learning this elementally neutral style do not believe in secrecy and the universal application of stealth. They do not train by walking on the unbroken eggshell of the dove, by holding complete conversational debates while making high-precision strikes or by meditating on the meaning of the poisons and diseases that they wield.
   Weapons and Armor: If martial artists did practice White Veil Style, they would treat the hand-needle and the garrote (both described in the Appendix) as form weapons. If anyone practiced this style, he would wear no armor while doing so.
   Complementary Abilities: A practitioner of the White Veil Style requires at least two dots in Socialize and another two dots in Larceny, Presence or Stealth. Most members of the White Veil Society find this a remarkably easy requirement.</description>

        <description>Even the most lovely singing bird cannot be heard over the sound of practice blades and training armor ringing off each other in the practice yard. In part, this is because the bird is small and its song quiet. In part, it is because the warriors-to-be are just not listening. Attacks made while this Charm is active can directly pierce or touch the Essence in the target's chakras, enabling the attack to have adverse effects even while they inflict no damage. For the duration of Birdsong Over Blades, the character may choose to inflict no actual health levels of damage with any of his individual Martial Arts attacks - but the target can still suffer wound penalties and supernatural effects, including poisons, contamination and the powers available through certain Charms. Some effects use the number of health levels lost to determine their extent, and for such purposes, the damage done is zero. Targets of attacks made to cause no damage do not know that they have been affected by other effects.</description>

        <description>When the silent-winged owl dives into the field and rises from the attack with claws empty, it becomes invisible in the darkness of night as if it had never appeared. Similarly, a character with this Charm may retract his claws as if he never bared them. Owl Clutches at the Night replaces reroll Charms and cannot be used in concert with one. The martial artist may invoke it after seeing the quality of his attack in Step 3 of attack resolution but before comparing it to his target's DVs. His player rolls (Wits + Martial Arts) at a difficulty of (target's Perception + 1). If successful, attack resolution ends immediately. It is as if he never attacked, though observers with a Perception greater than the number of successes rolled know he tried something... odd.</description>

        <description>Assuming this form is a matter of looking completely at ease. When using this form, there is nothing wrong, nothing hidden, and the character can hold up her end of a conversation even in battle. Such an unconcerned mien disconcerts foes in battle, taking one die from their dice pools when they try to attack her. The martial artist may also add a number of dice equal to her Essence to her Stealth attempts to reestablish surprise by sacrificing an equal number of dice from any attacks that benefit from that surprise. Bystanders hesitate when they see or hear the disparity between the victim, fighting for his life, and the character, whose speech and posture indicate a friendly altercation or test bout. Any attempts to Join Battle in response to seeing the fight suffer a -1 external penalty unless the individual witness has also mastered White Veil Form.</description>

            <description>There is no White Veil Society. It is not cunningly concealed among the apparently carefree Dragon-Blooded socialites of the Realm, its satrapies and Lookshy. No one would suggest that its members have a political agenda within and beyond the Scarlet Empire.

Moreover, an organization that does not exist certainly cannot have the influence or talent pool to develop its own subtle, social martial arts style.
   White Veil Style does not combine common, everyday movements with potent manipulations of chakras and Essence lines in a devastating and nearly invisible manner. It isn't one of the White Veil Society's many sources of secret power. It never sees use at the recitals, dinners and orgies of the Dynasts. People do not die from it, occasionally silently and occasionally screaming, days or weeks after not encountering it.Students who are not learning this elementally neutral style do not believe in secrecy and the universal application of stealth. They do not train by walking on the unbroken eggshell of the dove, by holding complete conversational debates while making high-precision strikes or by meditating on the meaning of the poisons and diseases that they wield.
   Weapons and Armor: If martial artists did practice White Veil Style, they would treat the hand-needle and the garrote (both described in the Appendix) as form weapons. If anyone practiced this style, he would wear no armor while doing so.
   Complementary Abilities: A practitioner of the White Veil Style requires at least two dots in Socialize and another two dots in Larceny, Presence or Stealth. Most members of the White Veil Society find this a remarkably easy requirement.</description>

        <description>In the best situations, a master of this Charm can eliminate the danger of retaliation - or even awareness. This Charm supplements an unexpected attack. As long as the character's relevant Stealth attempts for an unexpected attack (see Exalted, p. 155) successfully prevent anyone from making Join Battle rolls and his attack inflicts no damage (or otherwise does not capture the target's attention), no one is aware of it, even after the fact.</description>

        <description>For some, a quiet, unassuming death is a kindness. For others, it's a shame. Either way, this Charm gives them the chance to experience it. The character focuses Essence on the tip of her finger or in her concealed needle. She twists the Essence into a supernatural taint and lets it guide her subtle touch to the perfect place for unnoticed injection. This taint affects whomever the character successfully attacks next, as long as she does so before the Charm ends.
   The Dragon Dies in Bed creates a poison with the following traits: Damage (Essence x 4)B/minute, Toxicity (Essence)L, Tolerance -/-, Penalty -0. As a supernatural poison, it has a few additional qualities. It does not take effect immediately, and the player of someone subjected to it makes no immediate Resistance roll. Instead, it settles into the target's body and waits an unknown period of time (at least one week, no more than three) before it begins to tear the victim apart from the inside. Until then, it is undetectable without supernatural means. It also never begins to kill until the victim is asleep in bed. Most never feel it, and never wake up.
   Characters using this Charm can influence the poison's timing and deadliness. A (Wits + Medicine) roll, difficulty 2, allows the character to choose exactly when (from one to three weeks) the poison activates. Alternatively, a similar roll makes sure that it will not kill. Instead, the poison becomes dormant once the victim suffers his first wound in the Incapacitated level. It then kicks back in any time that health level heals, trying to keep the victim unconscious. The White Veil Stylist can inflict both these effects with a difficulty 3 roll.</description>

        <description>This Charm resembles The Dragon Dies in Bed, except it imbues the victim with a Sickness effect rather than poisoning him. If the martial artist can strike his target within the time limit, he infects her with a Second Circle spiritual disease (see p. 154 in the Appendix) with these traits:
    Virulence: (attacker's Essence)
    Incubation Period: (target's Essence) days
   Diagnosis: 3; Difficulty to Treat (Mundane/Magical): 3/1
    Morbidity: 5, Treated Morbidity: 3
   During the incubation period, the victim feels just a little bit off, maybe the result of a poor night's rest or a bit of bad food (or the epic equivalent for an Exalt). She suffers a -1 penalty to all actions. Once that period ends, the victim's condition worsens rapidly, so the victim's player must roll (Stamina + Resistance) for every hour the disease is active. On a failure, the victim suffers one level of unsoakable bashing damage and a penalty of -3 on all actions. (The morbidity roll is not an action). The target of this sickness must succeed at three consecutive checks before she defeats it entirely. Exalted always use the Treated Morbidity difficulty. Dying of this illness is extraordinarily painful.
   Characters who use this Charm or The Dragon Dies in Bed often taint their needle with mundane delayed-action poisons to soften the target before the final blow.</description>

        <description>This Charm functions somewhat like the two previous Charms: The martial artist sets the deadly Essence on her finger or needle, then must use it within the next few actions for it to take effect. When she hits someone with this attack, the Essence she injects into her target's body and the chakras she triggers force his body to ignore any poisons and diseases that are currently in his system. The body ceases to consider them threats, so it cannot react to them strongly, instead letting them run their course almost unhindered.
   To be sure that this Charm works, the character's player makes a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll at a difficulty of her target's Stamina. If she succeeds, the target's player subtracts an amount equal to the attacker's Essence from any rolls to withstand any poisons or diseases currently residing in the target's body. Obviously, a practitioner of this style will use this Charm after introducing other poisons and contaminants into the victim's body.</description>

            <description>The Crimson Pentacle Blade Style relies on the efficiency, power and versatility of formation fighting. The style remains effective in single combat, but it focuses on the choreography of multiple combatants (preferably sworn brotherhoods) to achieve ultimate victory. The diva-practitioners of this style are called "speardancers", and for all their vanity and narcissism, their art is as exotic and alluring as it is deadly.
   No one knows anymore who invented the Crimson Pentacle Blade Style. It certainly dates back at least to the Shogunate period. The style is particularly well known in the southern Realm, though schools can be found anywhere in the Threshold. The details of a speardancer's costume (or lack of it) reliably show what dojo taught her the art. Speardancers of every school dress and accouter themselves to show off their lithe, powerful bodies.
   Crimson Pentacle Blade Style lacks an elemental aspect. Any Terrestrial Exalt can practice it, with no elemental surcharge. On the other hand, most of the style's Charms require weapons or shields to use.
   Weapons and Armor: This flashy, flamboyant martial art combines the speed and reach of polearms with the defensive capabilities of shields. The variety of form weapons ranges from simple staves to artifact polearms such as dire lances or daikalbars (see p. 159). Speardancers wear no armor. They rely on their grace, their weapons, their shields and their Charms to defend them from harm.
   Complementary Abilities: Because of this style's strong emphasis on weapons and shields, practitioners must possess at least two dots in Melee. Crimson Pentacle Blade fighters often learn Melee Charms.</description>

        <description>Rather than armor or even thick clothing, spear-dancers rely on their shields to deflect arrows or turn aside weapon strikes. Using this Charm, the speardancer incorporates his shield effortlessly into his deadly blade dance - even a shield that would otherwise be too large or cumbersome to use. After activating the Charm, the martial artist does not suffer any mobility penalty for using his shield for one scene. He may use a long spear or poleaxe one-handed as long as he uses a buckler or target shield on his other arm.</description>

Upon activating this Charm, the martial artist adds a number of extra successes equal to her Essence to the result of her Join Battle roll.

        <description>To master this Form-type Charm, the martial artist has trained his muscles to supple perfection, and he can easily perform graceful leaps and impressive acrobatic feats on any sort of terrain - from a muddy battlefield to a rocking ship's deck to the desert's scorching sand. The martial artist can also deliver great, sweeping attacks with unerring precision while doing so. When this Charm is activated, the martial artist's player may add the Exalt's Essence score to all Martial Arts rolls for the rest of the scene. Also, add the martial artist's Essence score to her Athletics Ability for purposes of determining how easily she keeps her balance in a situation of unstable footing. That is, add (Athletics + Essence) and compare that value to the situation's instability rating. Should the instability rating of the situation exceed that value, the player must still make a (Dexterity + Athletics) roll for the character to maintain her balance. (See "Unstable Footing" on p. 155 of Exalted). The player does not add the character's Essence to that pool as extra dice: She adds the character's Essence to the result of the roll as extra successes.
   Finally, when a character using this Charm acts as a group's commander in order to coordinate the group's attack against an opponent, the character gains a number of extra successes equal to her Essence on the required (Charisma + War) roll. (See "Coordinating Attacks" on p. 144 of Exalted).</description>

        <description>The first thing one learns in the Eastern posture is how to move together in a group and use a shield effectively to protect the whole formation. With this Charm, a troupe or sworn brotherhood of speardancers bands together to protect one another with each other's shields, moving them in an intertwining pattern choreographed to cover one another and keep the shields out of each other's way. At least two martial artists must be in the formation to gain the benefit of this Charm. Each participant gains a flat +1 bonus to her DV against ranged and close-combat attacks, no matter how many participants use the Charm.
   The movements of this formation are such that the moving shields can protect one person without a shield for every shield-bearing individual in the formation (meaning only half the formation need carry shields in order to protect the entire formation). No one who does not know the Eastern Root Protocol may benefit from this formation, however, and all members of the formation must stay within the space permitted by the Five Directions Formation Protocol. Should even one move too far away, the effect of the Charm ends.</description>

        <description>The five fundamental beams that make up the Crimson Pentacle work together to complete the whole. If one beam is out of place or absent, the pentacle cannot exist. Such is the underlying theme of the protocols that speardancers practice as they study the Crimson Pentacle Blade Style. A single speardancer is fearsome, but when a troupe of like-trained dancers works together, it can accomplish what no dancer alone could do. Working together, usually under the leadership of a martial artist who has adopted the Eastern True Spear Posture, speardancers create specialized offensive and defensive routines known as protocols. The Five Directions Formation Protocol is the catchall "Charm" that allows speardancers to create and participate in these routines.
       Protocols are not proper Charms themselves, but rather Combos assembled by a troupe of speardancers and shared equally among its members. That is, a protocol takes individual Charms from separate characters and forges those Charms into a single Combo that each member of the troupe who contributed a Charm can use when the entire troupe works together. Like regular Combos, protocols must be named and have a signature appearance that distinguishes them to those who have seen them before. Protocols for a troupe are assembled just as normal Combos are for a single character. (The rules for doing so appear on pp. 244-245 of Exalted). Since the component Charms come from separate characters, though, certain costs must be divided when the protocol is both designed and used.
   The total experience point cost for developing a protocol is the same as it would be for a single character developing a Combo, namely the sum of the minimum Ability values of the component Charms. The time and the arduous training it takes to develop the protocol is the same for the team as it would be for a single Exalt developing the Charms into a Combo. When the team develops the protocol, each member pays a number of experience points equal to the minimum Ability value of the Charm(s) she contributed to the protocol. (If the players design a protocol that they want their characters to share at character creation, each player need spend only one bonus point per Charm her character contributed to the protocol). These development costs cannot be bartered or split up any other way among the characters.
   When the protocol is activated, the costs are divided more evenly among the troupe members. First of all, every member must spend a single point of Willpower in order to use the protocol. This Willpower cost is above and beyond any other cost associated with the protocol's component Charms. As with a regular Combo, the cost to activate a protocol is equal to the total cost of every component Charm, payable in full up front. The total Essence cost for using a protocol is divided as evenly as possible between all members of the troupe, regardless of how much any single component Charm costs to activate. The character with the highest Essence score pays the remainder motes. (If two characters' scores are tied, use the character with the highest [Dexterity + Martial Arts] total). If one or more of the component Charms has a variable Essence cost, calculate the required total using the minimum possible Essence cost of the variable-cost Charm. The character who contributed that Charm to the protocol may then pay extra motes of Essence to increase that Charm's effects. (This increased effect applies to every member of the troupe, though, not just the contributing character). This division of motes is only a guideline, however. If the players want to divide the Essence cost up differently based on their current circumstances, they can do so.
   If one of the component Charms in the protocol requires an activation roll of some variety, the player of the character who contributed the Charm makes the appropriate roll. This roll enjoys a one-die bonus for every person performing the protocol, including the character whose player is making the roll.
   Every Exalt in the formation must know the Five Directions Formation Protocol Charm in order to be able to contribute to or participate in the protocol. Every member in the formation must also add at least one Charm to the protocol. No single character in the formation needs to know all of the component Charms, though. Nor must every character who is part of a speardancer troupe contribute to the development of a new protocol. Only those speardancers who contribute may participate in that protocol, however. The protocol cannot include Form-type Charms, and no more than one Form-type Charm can be used by all the participants for the protocol's duration. (Since participants most likely all use the Crimson Pentacle Blade Form, this restriction seldom becomes onerous).
   Speardancers who wish to activate and participate in a protocol must be within the same 10-yard-radius area when the protocol is activated. Every member of the formation must be present as well, and they must all be conscious, mobile and able to take reflexive actions.For the formation to act together, every member's player rolls Join Battle normally. Even if the protocol isn't used at the start of a fight, this roll is needed to see how quickly the characters can join and activate the Combo. The speardancers must all wait until the last character is ready before they simultaneously take their actions and gain the benefits of the Combo. (This placement on the reaction count can change if a Charm that boosts movement speed is part of the protocol).
   One member, usually the leader, then attempts to activate the protocol as a reflexive action immediately after the Join Battle roll. When this character does so, the rest of the formation's members instantly recognize his intent and must reflexively decide whether to participate. Speardancers who must wait for slower teammates to "catch up" are considered to be taking a Guard action until everyone is ready to begin the Combo. Only if all members of the protocol decide to participate does the protocol actually activate. Otherwise, the protocol does not engage, and the characters are free to act as they wish individually. If all troupe members do agree and they can pay the activation cost, each participating member enjoys for one action the use of the protocol Combo created from their disparate Charms.
   Characters participating in a protocol need not apply their actions to the same target, but they are not prevented from doing so. Should the characters choose to attack the same target and use a custom protocol to do so, their attacks are not inherently considered to be coordinated.
   Only Exalts of the same type may combine their Charms into protocols using Five Directions Formation Protocol. Terrestrials can blend their Charms with other Terrestrials to form protocols, Solars can blend Charms with other Solars, and so on. What's more, Exalts who are not Terrestrials must pay double the experience costs to develop these protocol Combos. Eclipse Castes and Moonshadow Castes can violate these rules, but only if they spent the extra time (and experience points) to learn all the Charms in the Crimson Pentacle Blade Style, and any other Charms they place in a Combo as if they were the same kind of Exalt as their partners in the protocol. For instance, if a Quicksilver Falcon learned this style's Charms as a Terrestrial Exalt, he could participate in protocols with Dragon-Blooded characters. He could not form protocols with Lunars, Sidereals or even other Solar characters - because as far as other speardancers are concerned, he is a Terrestrial Exalt.</description>

        <description>A speardancer who adopts the Northern posture is as beautiful and graceful in moments of stillness as her Southern compatriots are in thrashing revel. With a cold, reptilian economy of energy, the Northern-posture speardancer cuts through the wasteful excess of her enemy's defenses. When the Exalt invokes this Charm, her target suffers a DV penalty equal to the martial artist's Essence against the martial artist's attack. Other attacks that happen to occur on that same tick are unaffected.</description>

        <description>As a stag's leaping grace and power keeps the majestic animal safe from the wolves, the martial artist's acrobatic skills aid in his defense. For every action in which he keeps moving in an acrobatic fashion - bounding over obstacles, tumbling past opponents, using his spear haft to vault, and so on - his player may make a reflexive (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll. Successes on this roll add to the character's DV for that action. Truly impressive acrobatic feats can accrue stunt bonuses as normal, but those bonuses do not apply to the aforementioned reflexive (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll. If the character is using the Crimson Pentacle Blade Form Charm while using this Charm, however, the form's Martial Arts bonus does apply to that aforementioned roll.</description>

        <description>If the martial artist's opponent makes an unsuccessful attack, the martial artist makes a reflexive counterattack with her shield, knocking her foe to the ground. The speardancer's player rolls her character's (Dexterity + Martial Arts) reflexively. The martial artist's target can defend against this action normally, but he cannot use a counterattack of his own against this counterattack. If the martial artist's roll succeeds, her target crashes to the dirt and must fight prone (suffering a -2 internal penalty) until he takes an action to get back to his feet. If the speardancer scores more successes than her target's (Strength + Essence) total, the target is knocked flat and winded and prone. The target suffers a -2 internal penalty for fighting prone and another -2 internal penalty for being stunned. Even worse, the target's player must make a reflexive (Wits + weapon-related Ability) roll and score as many successes as the martial artist has dots of Essence. If this roll fails, the character is disarmed (and winded and prone).
       Make the reflexive roll before applying the penalties. The martial artist may attempt as many Western Shield Crush Counterattacks from one action to the next as she can afford to pay for, one counterattack per attack upon her. As usual, however, a character cannot use this Charm in response to any counterattack Charm.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Exalt centers himself and con-centrates, willing shining Essence to surround his arms, shoulders and upper back. When this Essence settles on the martial artist's body, it materializes and takes on the Charm's eponymous appearance, appropriate to the Exalt's elemental aspect. For example, a Fire-aspected martial artist might adorn himself with rubies and garnets held together in a latticework of shining obsidian, while a Water-aspect speardancer might create a covering of seashells and pearls. Regardless, the Exalt who invokes this Charm adds his Essence to his bashing and lethal soaks for the scene. The effect of this Charm is not armor per se, more like a form of natural soak, so it doesn't conflict with the armor prohibition for this style.</description>

        </prerequest>
        <description>As the martial artist adopts the Southern posture, she uses her vigorous, dramatic sweeps and slashes in a ritualized kata that stokes the fires of bravery in others' hearts. As the Exalt invokes this Charm, a banner of pure Essence erupts from the head of her weapon. The banner's edge glitters with precious gems and tapers away in a six-foot-long pendant. High Realm kanji encouraging fearlessness and honor scintillate along its length, and tassels of fiery Essence line the banner's inner curve. Once invoked, this pendant lasts for the entire scene or until the Exalt who invoked it wishes otherwise.
   The display uses the character's (Charisma + Martial Arts) at difficulty 1, plus one more for every three targets she wishes to affect. Bonuses from the Crimson Pentacle Blade Form Charm and from being a student of the Southern Scythe Posture apply to this roll as normal. If the roll succeeds, the Exalt stirs the crowd into a battle fury, and all those so inspired are gifted with a temporary +1 boost to Valor for the scene. This Charm is also stackable, but only if it is invoked by separate speardancers in the same scene. The vision of an entire troupe of speardancers performing an intertwining kata, each waving their banners in unison, could tempt even the most fearful, beaten-down rabble to take up arms and go to war for a cause they now consider righteous.</description>

            <description>The Crimson Pentacle Blade Style relies on the efficiency, power and versatility of formation fighting. The style remains effective in single combat, but it focuses on the choreography of multiple combatants (preferably sworn brotherhoods) to achieve ultimate victory. The diva-practitioners of this style are called "speardancers", and for all their vanity and narcissism, their art is as exotic and alluring as it is deadly.
   No one knows anymore who invented the Crimson Pentacle Blade Style. It certainly dates back at least to the Shogunate period. The style is particularly well known in the southern Realm, though schools can be found anywhere in the Threshold. The details of a speardancer's costume (or lack of it) reliably show what dojo taught her the art. Speardancers of every school dress and accouter themselves to show off their lithe, powerful bodies.
   Crimson Pentacle Blade Style lacks an elemental aspect. Any Terrestrial Exalt can practice it, with no elemental surcharge. On the other hand, most of the style's Charms require weapons or shields to use.
   Weapons and Armor: This flashy, flamboyant martial art combines the speed and reach of polearms with the defensive capabilities of shields. The variety of form weapons ranges from simple staves to artifact polearms such as dire lances or daikalbars (see p. 159). Speardancers wear no armor. They rely on their grace, their weapons, their shields and their Charms to defend them from harm.
   Complementary Abilities: Because of this style's strong emphasis on weapons and shields, practitioners must possess at least two dots in Melee. Crimson Pentacle Blade fighters often learn Melee Charms.</description>

        <description>When a martial artist has invoked the prerequisite Charm, he may choose to invoke the Furious Battle Scythe as well. The flashing pendant created by the Glorious Southern Harbinger of War and Fury Charm crystallizes into the fearsome blade of a magnificent scythe. Using this Charm while wielding a polearm grants +1 to Accuracy, +5 to Damage and +1 to Rate, and it imposes a Parry DV penalty of -1. Characters cannot activate this Charm unless they have already activated the prerequisite Charm in the same scene.</description>

        <description>When one is committed to a battle, there is no greater dishonor than to retreat before the outcome is decided. Even if all of her soldiers desert her and all of her comrades have been killed, a speardancer must not flee. Fortunately, a speardancer can hold a bridge or gate almost indefinitely with this Charm and also prevent anyone from escaping combat once they've engaged with her. The character spends Essence, and her player makes a reflexive (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll for the Exalt to attack anyone who tries to flank or otherwise get around her. (She can reach anyone making such an attempt within a maximum distance equal to her Essence in yards). She may also make such an attack if her opponent attempts to flee her presence once she has entered into hand-to-hand combat.</description>

        <description>With this Charm, the Exalt fortifies his weapon toward some noble purpose. He spends a short, quiet period alone, ritually cleaning and sharpening his weapon, then he speaks aloud the task to which his weapon shall be used victoriously. (This task must be a specific one, such as, "Today, you and I shall finally destroy the Lunar Anathema whose barbarian horde razed our village").
   For the next day, the martial artist may add his permanent Essence to the Damage of his weapon when he uses it in pursuit of his task. He can even stack as many tasks on a single weapon as he has Essence dots. The maximum Damage bonus awarded by this Charm to a single strike cannot exceed the character's Essence, however.</description>

        <description>With utmost mastery of her art, the speardancer becomes a living storm of death. His fluid, acrobatic style lets him position himself to maximize his weapon's usefulness against multiple foes. When he activates this Charm, the Exalt perceives a graceful, sweeping path that effortlessly connects a number of opponents equal to his permanent Essence. It is but a heartbeat's worth of effort to trace his weapon through this connection, striking every foe in one long stroke. The character's player makes a single (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll - including appropriate bonuses from this style's Form-type Charm - for her to hit all targets at a -1 internal penalty for each target after the first (to a maximum of -3). Targets apply their DVs individually as normal. The martial artist counts the extra successes from his attack twice when adding them to his raw damage total, and he rolls damage separately against each target (based on how well their DVs defended them).
   This Charm provides no special defense against or protection from coordinated attacks performed by multiple opponents. The Essence for this Charm must be spent before making the attack roll.</description>

            <description>The famous and popular Even Blade Style is known not just for its practitioners' subtlety, speed and awareness, but for the story of its founders. The Masters Azure Crane, Zu Rat Te and Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe (self-styled First of Heaven's Chosen) are three of the most sought-af-ter teachers in Creation. Young hopefuls travel hundreds of miles for the chance to study in one of their dojos. All three learned from the same sifu and once formed a sworn brotherhood that performed deeds of legend - but they split up almost 200 years ago and established separate dojos.
       Rumor in the Martial Arts World says the masters now hate each other because they could not reconcile their differences about the style they designed together. (Spiteful former peers say they fell out in a three-way lover's tiff). Each master certainly argued for one particular ending to the Even Blade Style. Their passion, skill and inability to agree resulted in something so rare that most masters thought it impossible: Each of them created their own, specific style, that yet began in the same way as the others'.
   The three teachers' dissension also had wider ramifications than they realized, which was revealed when Resolute Brigada, a student of Azure Crane's, abandoned her teacher to study with Zu Rat Te. Brigada discovered, to her horror, that this gained her not Zu Rat Te's Even Blade variant, but an entirely new, fourth version of the style. Brigada did not set up her own school because she thought she had failed to follow Zu Rat Te's ideal path. To this day, she tells most would-be students that they should follow Zu Rat Te's teaching instead.
   Despite their stylistic differences, all three masters (and their disciples who set up dojos of their own) use similar training methods. Students learn basic kicks, blocks, strikes and thrusts in the classroom as well as 20 elaborate katas using wooden practice blades. All three masters also enjoy assigning tasks that initially seem useless, arbitrary and impossible. Master Azure Crane insists that her best students be able to catch a buzzing fly between two tooth-picks. Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe, First of Heaven's Chosen, sometimes starves his apprentices for days on end. The followers of Master Zu Rat Te commiserate about being asked to pull a specific straw from a bale of hay in one swift strike, without warning or preparation.
   All three teachers also place a particular emphasis on ritualistic, meditative upkeep of one's sword. The blade, they constantly repeat, must be treated with loyalty and faith, respected as a close partner and loved as a friend. Since the style focuses so much on sword usage, some dojos also work hard on Melee Charms and encourage students to use them in Combos with the traditional Even Blade Charms. In those places, an apprentice is lauded more for coming up with an interesting and flexible new Combo than for actually mastering the style itself.
   Even Blade Style is elementally neutral. It focuses on the blade, not any particular element.
   Weapons and Armor: The Even Blade Style favors slashing swords. Indeed, sifus generally demand that their followers use one and will judge an unknown stylist by the quality of her blade. Master Azure Crane, in particular, does not even teach how to use the style with other weapons or barehanded (though her assistants surreptitiously make sure her students know how anyway).
   Characters may use this style while wearing armor, but only up to medium weight.
   Complementary Abilities: Even Blade dojos teach conventional swordsmanship as well as the style's special techniques. To learn this martial art, a character must possess at least two dots in Melee.</description>

        <description>Briefly standing very still, the martial artist tilts her head. Then, with a shout, she strikes suddenly, surprising her enemies. This Charm may be used when a character performs an attack action (but not a flurry) on a tick in which others also take actions: Her attack goes before any other actions on that tick. Her target uses the lower of his DVs from before his action or from after his action to defend against her, and the martial artist herself uses the higher of her DVs from before her action or after her action against all attacks on that tick.
   If other characters use similar Charms to make their actions go first, then everyone involved acts simultaneously, as discussed on page 141 of Exalted.</description>

        <description>Drawing breath carefully, constantly wary, the martial artist is always ready for battle. This Charm supplements a Join Battle action. Instead of his player rolling Join Battle, the character may spend three motes simply to have a number of successes on the roll equal to his Martial Arts. A character who fights barehanded may always use Breath and Essence Control normally, but if he uses a sword, then the martial artist may invoke this Charm only while it is sheathed. When he does the latter, the Charm allows him to ready his weapon as a reflexive action instead of a miscellaneous action.</description>

All three masters also enjoy assigning tasks that initially seem useless, arbitrary and impossible. Master Azure Crane insists that her best students be able to catch a buzzing fly between two tooth-picks.

The followers of Master Zu Rat Te commiserate about being asked to pull a specific straw from a bale of hay in one swift strike, without warning or preparation.
   All three teachers also place a particular emphasis on ritualistic, meditative upkeep of one's sword. The blade, they constantly repeat, must be treated with loyalty and faith, respected as a close partner and loved as a friend. Since the style focuses so much on sword usage, some dojos also work hard on Melee Charms and encourage students to use them in Combos with the traditional Even Blade Charms. In those places, an apprentice is lauded more for coming up with an interesting and flexible new Combo than for actually mastering the style itself.
   Even Blade Style is elementally neutral. It focuses on the blade, not any particular element.
   Weapons and Armor: The Even Blade Style favors slashing swords. Indeed, sifus generally demand that their followers use one and will judge an unknown stylist by the quality of her blade. Master Azure Crane, in particular, does not even teach how to use the style with other weapons or barehanded (though her assistants surreptitiously make sure her students know how anyway).
   Characters may use this style while wearing armor, but only up to medium weight.

        <description>Concentrating hard, the martial artist blinks slowly, then whirls into action. A character can use the Charm as part of a normal attack, or reflexively to abort an already-begun Aim action. The martial artist focuses, spots a weakness and  ARTS attacks. If her target suffers penalties to his DV - whether onslaught, mobility or anything else - then those penalties double when the target defends against the martial artist.
   Additionally, for the briefest moment, the character sees phantom trails of Essence hanging in the air around her foe and may trace their sources. The martial artist's player may ask the Storyteller a single effect-related question about her foe -regarding his Charms, enchanted weaponry, divine blessings, general defensive skill and so on - to which the Storyteller must supply an honest, if vague, response. Questions such as, "Is he using any soak Charms?", "Why are those arrows glowing?" and "Is it even possible for me to hit this guy?" are appropriate. Inappropriate queries involve specific numbers, odds calculation or relative values.Close Your Eyes and Look may be used only once per action.</description>

            <description>The famous and popular Even Blade Style is known not just for its practitioners' subtlety, speed and awareness, but for the story of its founders. The Masters Azure Crane, Zu Rat Te and Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe (self-styled First of Heaven's Chosen) are three of the most sought-af-ter teachers in Creation. Young hopefuls travel hundreds of miles for the chance to study in one of their dojos. All three learned from the same sifu and once formed a sworn brotherhood that performed deeds of legend - but they split up almost 200 years ago and established separate dojos.
       Rumor in the Martial Arts World says the masters now hate each other because they could not reconcile their differences about the style they designed together. (Spiteful former peers say they fell out in a three-way lover's tiff). Each master certainly argued for one particular ending to the Even Blade Style. Their passion, skill and inability to agree resulted in something so rare that most masters thought it impossible: Each of them created their own, specific style, that yet began in the same way as the others'.
   The three teachers' dissension also had wider ramifications than they realized, which was revealed when Resolute Brigada, a student of Azure Crane's, abandoned her teacher to study with Zu Rat Te. Brigada discovered, to her horror, that this gained her not Zu Rat Te's Even Blade variant, but an entirely new, fourth version of the style. Brigada did not set up her own school because she thought she had failed to follow Zu Rat Te's ideal path. To this day, she tells most would-be students that they should follow Zu Rat Te's teaching instead.

        <description>With a narrow glance left, right, then straight ahead, the martial artist extends his blade before him and watches a gleam chase down its edge. His mind calms, and his eyes darken; he is beyond distraction and imprecision.
   For the rest of the scene, the character cannot be perturbed or confused by anything that would distract him at a crucial moment or disrupt his battle focus, even if it is a magical effect specifically designed for that purpose. Furthermore, due to the martial artist's lightning-swift cuts and supernatural exactitude, his DV refreshes one tick earlier than it should based on his action's Speed. (The effect excludes counterattacks). The character cannot act again until the proper interval of ticks has elapsed, but his DV refreshes one tick early. Yet, even if he somehow achieves a Speed of 2 or lower, the Even Blade Form can never remove the associated DV penalty for an action on the tick directly after the martial artist performed it.
   Example: Azure Crane's exquisite, mirror-bright blade has a Speed of 4. She performs a flurry on tick one, her sword moving in a brilliant blur as she slices at her opponent's arm, cuts open his leg and finishes with a casual, insulting flick across his cheek. On ticks two and three, her DV is reduced by three because of the three attacks, but her DV will be back to its original value on tick four, rather than on tick five when she acts again. If she obtained a magic blade of light and air with a Speed of 1, though, she would still take the DV penalty on tick two, even if she attacked again, because that is the tick directly after the tick on which she previously acted.
   Although the Even Blade Form is intended partly to exalt the sword, it can be used perfectly well without one. If a character begins use of the Form-type Charm while wielding a sword, however, being disarmed or losing his blade instantly deactivates the Charm. The martial artist will have to activate it again (taking six ticks and five motes of Essence) to gain its benefits.</description>

        <description>With a sudden red flare around her hands, the martial artist brings all her strength to bear in one tightly focused strike. A successful attack deals piercing damage, but the Fiery Garda Force Attack has another aspect. If the martial artist's foe successfully parries the Charm-supplemented attack, then the character may reflexively spend a Willpower point to break the parrying weapon. The martial artist is not required to attempt this.
   Artifacts cannot be broken in this way, but most normal weapons shatter or are sliced in half. A fine, exceptional or perfect weapon (as detailed on p. 365 of Exalted) may resist destruction. The owner's player may roll one, two or three dice, respectively, with success indicating that the weapon withstood the awful blow. The three great masters of the Even Blade Style teach their students that great quality ought to be admired and that the bearer of a great weapon should be respected. Oftentimes, practitioners will pull back and bow to such a foe respectfully before continuing the fight.
   If a weapon is broken by means of Fiery Garda Force Attack, then the martial artist may continue the attack against its bearer. She loses three successes from her attack roll, but otherwise, it is resolved normally and as if the target had no Parry DV in the first place.</description>

        <description>A terrible light flares across the martial artist's face as he surveys the battle. Then, as he slices - with hands or blade - straight through his enemies, the blood that splashes so liberally upon him seems to seep into his skin, leaving only a greenish shadow to mark its passage. The character inflicts lethal damage even if barehanded, and for every health level the character inflicts until his next action, he regains a mote of Essence.</description>

            <description>The famous and popular Even Blade Style is known not just for its practitioners' subtlety, speed and awareness, but for the story of its founders. The Masters Azure Crane, Zu Rat Te and Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe (self-styled First of Heaven's Chosen) are three of the most sought-af-ter teachers in Creation. Young hopefuls travel hundreds of miles for the chance to study in one of their dojos. All three learned from the same sifu and once formed a sworn brotherhood that performed deeds of legend - but they split up almost 200 years ago and established separate dojos.
       Rumor in the Martial Arts World says the masters now hate each other because they could not reconcile their differences about the style they designed together. (Spiteful former peers say they fell out in a three-way lover's tiff). Each master certainly argued for one particular ending to the Even Blade Style. Their passion, skill and inability to agree resulted in something so rare that most masters thought it impossible: Each of them created their own, specific style, that yet began in the same way as the others'.
   The three teachers' dissension also had wider ramifications than they realized, which was revealed when Resolute Brigada, a student of Azure Crane's, abandoned her teacher to study with Zu Rat Te. Brigada discovered, to her horror, that this gained her not Zu Rat Te's Even Blade variant, but an entirely new, fourth version of the style. Brigada did not set up her own school because she thought she had failed to follow Zu Rat Te's ideal path. To this day, she tells most would-be students that they should follow Zu Rat Te's teaching instead.
   Despite their stylistic differences, all three masters (and their disciples who set up dojos of their own) use similar training methods. Students learn basic kicks, blocks, strikes and thrusts in the classroom as well as 20 elaborate katas using wooden practice blades. All three masters also enjoy assigning tasks that initially seem useless, arbitrary and impossible. Master Azure Crane insists that her best students be able to catch a buzzing fly between two tooth-picks. Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe, First of Heaven's Chosen, sometimes starves his apprentices for days on end. The followers of Master Zu Rat Te commiserate about being asked to pull a specific straw from a bale of hay in one swift strike, without warning or preparation.
   All three teachers also place a particular emphasis on ritualistic, meditative upkeep of one's sword. The blade, they constantly repeat, must be treated with loyalty and faith, respected as a close partner and loved as a friend. Since the style focuses so much on sword usage, some dojos also work hard on Melee Charms and encourage students to use them in Combos with the traditional Even Blade Charms. In those places, an apprentice is lauded more for coming up with an interesting and flexible new Combo than for actually mastering the style itself.
   Even Blade Style is elementally neutral. It focuses on the blade, not any particular element.
   Weapons and Armor: The Even Blade Style favors slashing swords. Indeed, sifus generally demand that their followers use one and will judge an unknown stylist by the quality of her blade. Master Azure Crane, in particular, does not even teach how to use the style with other weapons or barehanded (though her assistants surreptitiously make sure her students know how anyway).
   Characters may use this style while wearing armor, but only up to medium weight.
   Complementary Abilities: Even Blade dojos teach conventional swordsmanship as well as the style's special techniques. To learn this martial art, a character must possess at least two dots in Melee.</description>

        <description>The martial artist raises his gaze steadily, and his eyes glow softly. The blood seeping from his wounds shimmers a luminous white. Until the character takes his next action, he suffers no wound penalties, he adds his Martial Arts to his bashing soak and he adds half his Martial Arts (rounded up) to his lethal soak.
   The martial artist cannot prevent himself from dying by using Stubborn Jokun Defensive Posture, but he may use it to act normally while Incapacitated or Dying, and may reactivate it on each action to continue to do so.</description>

        <description>The martial artist's hands flicker and come up holding both her blade and its sheath, crossed one over the other. For the remainder of the scene, the sheath is considered as hard as the blade it houses and can be used to parry (with the sword's own Defense value added to the pool). Once per enemy action, this gives the character a chance to bat aside her opponent's weapon and strike back: On successful parries, she may counterattack with her full Martial Arts dice pool.
       Master Azure Crane discourages it, but this Charm may be used while unarmed. In this case the character can, again, counterattack once per enemy action as long as she successfully parries. Players should keep in mind that it is impossible to parry lethal damage barehanded without a stunt.</description>

        <description>Pulling her hands apart, one with sword and one with its sheath, the martial artist sizes up her opponent, then flicks blade or sheath into the space directly before her. As long as the character's other hand wields the weapon or sheath, its mate will dance gracefully in midair in exquisite counterpoint.
   Whichever item "dances", the martial artist has a choice each action how to use the sword and sheath. The character can attack with both sword and sheath, gaining an extra action. Alternatively, the character can attack with one item while the other deflects attacks upon her. In this case, the hovering weapon or sheath counters all penalties the martial artist may suffer for coordinated attacks or onslaughts, with a further +1 bonus to her Parry DV. The sheath inflicts damage equal to its blade, but that damage is bashing.
   The martial artist may decide which is dancing - sword or sheath - at the beginning of each action. Targeting the weapon or sheath requires a normal Disarm roll against the martial artist. The sheath is considered to have a DV equal to the character's own, whereas the blade is not considered to be parrying.
   At any time, as long as the martial artist holds one of the pair, she may reflexively call the sword or sheath to her other hand.
       Loyal Dancing Lovers Technique may be used bare-handed (though the suggestion one might do so is enough to put Master Azure Crane in a sarcastic mood for weeks). When activated without a weapon, it simply renders the martial artist ambidextrous.</description>

        <description>Roaring, the martial artist rushes forward, her eyes ablaze with Essence. As long as she inflicts at least one health level of damage, her target is automatically crippled. If the total damage comes to three or more health levels, then the relevant limb is completely removed. Even if Exalted, a target so injured has suffered a disabling wound (as described on p. 152 of Exalted), which will continue to inflict penalties until surgically or magically treated.</description>

        <description>As her strike bites deep, the martial artist shouts in joyous rage and calls upon all her strength to force it still deeper. Then she turns her hand or blade to one side, wrenching it out in a shower of gore. After her attack has been resolved, the character may spend five motes to double her total post-roll damage.</description>

            <description>The famous and popular Even Blade Style is known not just for its practitioners' subtlety, speed and awareness, but for the story of its founders. The Masters Azure Crane, Zu Rat Te and Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe (self-styled First of Heaven's Chosen) are three of the most sought-af-ter teachers in Creation. Young hopefuls travel hundreds of miles for the chance to study in one of their dojos. All three learned from the same sifu and once formed a sworn brotherhood that performed deeds of legend - but they split up almost 200 years ago and established separate dojos.
       Rumor in the Martial Arts World says the masters now hate each other because they could not reconcile their differences about the style they designed together. (Spiteful former peers say they fell out in a three-way lover's tiff). Each master certainly argued for one particular ending to the Even Blade Style. Their passion, skill and inability to agree resulted in something so rare that most masters thought it impossible: Each of them created their own, specific style, that yet began in the same way as the others'.
   The three teachers' dissension also had wider ramifications than they realized, which was revealed when Resolute Brigada, a student of Azure Crane's, abandoned her teacher to study with Zu Rat Te. Brigada discovered, to her horror, that this gained her not Zu Rat Te's Even Blade variant, but an entirely new, fourth version of the style. Brigada did not set up her own school because she thought she had failed to follow Zu Rat Te's ideal path. To this day, she tells most would-be students that they should follow Zu Rat Te's teaching instead.
   Despite their stylistic differences, all three masters (and their disciples who set up dojos of their own) use similar training methods. Students learn basic kicks, blocks, strikes and thrusts in the classroom as well as 20 elaborate katas using wooden practice blades. All three masters also enjoy assigning tasks that initially seem useless, arbitrary and impossible. Master Azure Crane insists that her best students be able to catch a buzzing fly between two tooth-picks. Master Lord Chaowin Registrophe, First of Heaven's Chosen, sometimes starves his apprentices for days on end. The followers of Master Zu Rat Te commiserate about being asked to pull a specific straw from a bale of hay in one swift strike, without warning or preparation.
   All three teachers also place a particular emphasis on ritualistic, meditative upkeep of one's sword. The blade, they constantly repeat, must be treated with loyalty and faith, respected as a close partner and loved as a friend. Since the style focuses so much on sword usage, some dojos also work hard on Melee Charms and encourage students to use them in Combos with the traditional Even Blade Charms. In those places, an apprentice is lauded more for coming up with an interesting and flexible new Combo than for actually mastering the style itself.
   Even Blade Style is elementally neutral. It focuses on the blade, not any particular element.
   Weapons and Armor: The Even Blade Style favors slashing swords. Indeed, sifus generally demand that their followers use one and will judge an unknown stylist by the quality of her blade. Master Azure Crane, in particular, does not even teach how to use the style with other weapons or barehanded (though her assistants surreptitiously make sure her students know how anyway).
   Characters may use this style while wearing armor, but only up to medium weight.
   Complementary Abilities: Even Blade dojos teach conventional swordsmanship as well as the style's special techniques. To learn this martial art, a character must possess at least two dots in Melee.</description>

        <description>Completely imperturbable, the martial artist's expression hardly changes as his hand flashes out to smack his opponent. Supplemented with three motes, the character's attack inflicts bashing damage even if a sword or Charm is used, but if he hits, then he may choose where. His choice of target has the following effects:
• Wrists: Unless his opponent succeeds on a normal roll to avoid being disarmed, she cries out and drops her weapon like a disciplined child.
• Face: For a number of actions equal to the health levels inflicted by the attack, the target suffers an additional -1 wound penalty due to the viciously stinging, swelling welts across both cheeks.
• Stomach: The target doubles over and falls ignominiously prone unless her player succeeds on a (Stamina + Athletics) roll with an external penalty equal to the martial artist's Essence.
   Use of this Charm does not require that a character's blade be drawn, even if he uses it. Players must succeed on a (Perception + Awareness) roll for their characters to see the strike coming, even if the martial artist stands directly in front of them and they watch him carefully. If the target fails this roll, then Stumbling Inconvenience Attack is treated as an unexpected attack (see Exalted, p. 155). If the target succeeds, and a fight has not already begun, she may roll Join Battle against the character as usual. When a character uses this Charm in the middle of a conflict, the martial artist is not considered to be reestablishing surprise, so players rolling (Perception + Awareness) for their characters to spot the enhanced attack don't gain any relevant bonuses.</description>

        <description>The scene is quiet. The martial artist faces his foe with his arms crossed indifferently. She insults him, and the observers turn to look at his reaction. There is none but a cool smile. Yet, when they look back at his opponent, she has collapsed, gurgling, to her knees.
   Impossible Unseen Strike launches a single undetected attack. If the character wishes, he may unsheathe his sword, strike and sheathe it again, and his attack still goes unnoticed. Unless the target has a magical means of detecting unexpected attacks, this attack automatically counts as unexpected. Like Stumbling Inconvenience Attack, this Charm may be used in the midst of a battle that's already in progress, in which case it allows the character one un-detected attack as his action.</description>

        <description>As her foe comes forward, the character seizes his weapon and effortlessly twists it out of his grasp. All penalties to the martial artist's Parry DV are eliminated, and she may block lethal damage barehanded without a stunt. If she successfully parries an attack, then her opponent's player must roll against a disarm attempt as if she obtained successes on the roll equal to her Martial Arts. If her opponent is unarmed, then he finds the character has grabbed his wrist and pulled him into a grapple (see Exalted, p. 157).
   The martial artist must have one hand free in order to use this Charm.</description>

        <description>None can escape the character's grasping, clawlike hands. The martial artist can grapple as many people as she wants, as long as their combined Strength scores do not exceed her (Strength + Martial Arts). She also retains her DV even while she holds the clinch and can parry incoming attacks with one of the people she holds. In this case, the Defense rating of a person is considered to be +3, and if one is successfully used to block, then the damage from the attack should be rolled against him as if he had no DV. Furthermore, the character can parry lethal damage unarmed without a stunt and can drag her new charges about without effort. She does not have to roll to maintain any clinches unless she wishes to take a clinch action, such as breaking a hold or crushing an opponent. (Someone caught in the clinch may force a roll to maintain the clinch on his action by spending a Willpower point, but if he loses the contest, he's in the same position as before). Players should keep in mind that characters who are grappling can only take clinch-related actions. This is still true for those using Many Raptors Stance, although they are also capable of initiating new clinch attacks.</description>

            <name>Fivefold Shadow Hand Style</name>
            <description>The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is mainly practiced by criminal organizations such as its inventor, the Five Shade Association (see pp. 29-30). For centuries, its practitioners have brought eternal peace to "impossible to kill" targets - and eternal frustration to the law-enforcement officials trying to round them up. Through yoga-like meditation and a combination of arcane gestures and endlessly repeated katas, students learn to channel elemental Essences through their hands and chakras. At the root (or, as stylists like to call it, the palm) of these powers lies an understanding of quiet violence and the art of assassination. Unfolding outward from that, each finger of the shadow hand specializes in the tricks and traps of one of Creation's elements. The true power of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style comes from mastering one's natural element, then decoding the secrets of the others to round out the discipline.
   The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is seldom taught by a single sifu. There is usually a group involved, since different practitioners favor different elements and, therefore, different training methods. In the Five Shade Association, each practitioner favors one element, either because of Terrestrial Exaltation or as part of a patron elemental's gift of Essence-manipulation. (Practitioners who wouldn't normally have a native element, such as Solars or the majority of mortal Essence-wielders, always find that they tend more toward one than the others. In such cases, the player should choose whichever element she thinks best fits her character's personality and declare that the character's "aspect". If a character doesn't have an elemental aspect before learning this style, she will once she learns the Apprentice Gesture. That affinity will apply to learning other elementally aspected martial arts styles too).
• Air-associated training usually involves elevation and silence. Although sifus use different methods, all agree on these points: If a trainee's feet touch the ground, she has failed, and when her exercises are done, even the most perceptive listeners should have heard nothing but the wind. Earth-aligned dojos are often built within hidden caves, where masked students strive to understand the subtlety of human postures and the power of anonymous unity. Each student must learn to identify her anonymous fellows' personalities and agendas despite their hidden faces. Just as importantly, they must recognize each other when they aren't garbed as assassins.
• A Shadow Hand martial artist aspected toward Fire trains to move in darkness and make swift, surprise attacks. His training involves fighting blindfolded and trying to slice squares of silk or small sticks into pieces before they fall to the ground.
• Water-aspected training often takes place in swamps and sewers. Students are expected to master their finer sensibilities and perform normally revolting tasks without flinching. A favorite test is for students to hold a handstand with their faces inches from stinking sludge while wearing white socks - the aim being for both socks to remain clean when the sifu returns.
• Wood-followers use trickery and misdirection. Sifus bid their charges to study particularly sly and elusive animals and imitate their postures and forms of movement. They also study the tricks of coloration, motion and stillness by which these creatures confuse their natural predators.
       Practitioners refer to the elements not by their most widely used names, but by specific pseudonyms. Earth is generally called the Mountain; Air, the Breeze; Water, the Mist; Fire, the Smoke; and Wood, the Forgotten.
   Sifus of the style note that certain elements associate with each other. The two katas of Smoke, for example, both include Breeze as a secondary element, whereas neither involves Mist. Breeze, they conjecture, is the natural ally of Smoke - Mist, its natural enemy. The elements seem to go in a cycle of destruction, with Smoke burning the Forgotten, which covers the Mountain, which blocks the Breeze, which dispels the Mist, which, again, drowns the Smoke. On the other hand, the Forgotten refreshes the Breeze, which fans the Smoke, which renews the Mountain, which channels the Mist, which feeds the Forgotten. These cycles reveal the flows and transformations of elemental Essence.
   The advanced Charms for each element involve a degree of usurpation or assimilation of the next element in the creative cycle. Mist usurps the poisoning natural to Wood. The Mountain katas include the fluidity and mutability of Water. Smoke takes on the darkness, secrecy and stasis of Earth. Breeze merges the intangibility of Air with the evanescence of Fire. The Forgotten completes the cycle by usurping the invisibility of Air.
   The style's Charm tree has a peculiar structure. First, practitioners learn the Apprentice and Adept Gestures for their own element. Next, in no particular order, they can learn the style's Form-type Charm and two element katas. Each kata combines the character's personal elemental aspect (using the appropriate [Element] Adept Gesture as a prerequisite) with two other elements. Once the character knows these three Charms, she can learn the style's terminal Charm. Once she knows Fivefold Shadow Hand Form, she can then learn katas based on other elements. (The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion). When the student learns two katas based on an element, she can use the Apprentice Gesture of that element as well. Nothing prevents a martial artist from learning the Apprentice Gesture of another element before then, except a desire to avoid wasted effort. (Sorry, but players don't get back the experience points they spend on Gesture Charms once the character reaches the point where she would gain them anyway). A character aspected to one element must pay a one-mote surcharge to use Charms (or sub-forms of Charms) aspected to a different element, unless she's a Dragon-Blood aspected to Water.
       Many of the advanced Charms have an aspect of illu-sion or deception. They are not obvious at the time (which would defeat the purpose of the illusion) but witnesses can figure out later that the assassin did something magical. An alert person might notice and remember the peculiar way the martial artist positioned his hands and watch for that gesture in the future.
   Weapons and Armor: The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style as a whole lacks form weapons. Instead, followers of different elements use different form weapons: Smoke uses the short sword, the Forgotten uses the tonfa, the Mountain uses rope weapons, the Breeze uses the shuriken, and Mist uses the knife. When a martial artist learns a kata that traditionally belongs to another element [see the "The Share-(Element) Keyword" sidebar, p. 77], she also learns the usage of that element's favored weapon and can thenceforth use it with the style's Charms as well as the weapon of her favored element.
       Most martial artists who use the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style don't bother to use weapons at all, though. Almost every Charm past (Element) Apprentice Gesture requires the martial artist to keep both hands together as long as she invokes it, and it's easier for practitioners who are trying to stay unnoticed to do so if they're not carrying obviously dangerous items. Those who do use and carry weapons, have probably mastered the Shadow Palm Invocation. In some circles, merely carrying a weapon can lead some people to treat the character with the utmost respect, believing that she has learned the whole style.

        <description>People who practice socially unsanctioned modes of achieving their ends (so to speak) often need to use unexpected routes and tactics. By folding a particular finger to center of her palm while invoking this Charm, a character can act freely in a given environment, depending on which element she favors:
• Breeze: Dancing through the air as swiftly and lightly as any zephyr (and holding her smallest finger against her palm), the martial artist does not need to take a miscellaneous action to jump. All jumps are considered an included part of her Move or Dash actions.
• The Forgotten: Thumb pressed to her palm, the martial artist can run without impediment through any area where movement is possible at all, even those that are densely and confusingly packed. She will not be accidentally hindered or restricted as she moves, even if she's rushing through a vine-riddled jungle or a confused crowd.
• Mountain: Not only does folding her middle finger down to her palm fail to hinder the character's climbing, it enhances it. She may add her Martial Arts to any climbing roll, as well as double the rate at which she climbs.
• Mist: Although her balance is not enhanced, folding her ring finger into her right palm allows the character to walk on any surface - solid or liquid - without taking damage, even if it would normally be too hot, abrasive or otherwise dangerous to do so.
• Smoke: While the character folds her index finger into her palm, she may ignore all environmental penalties caused by darkness if there is any light at all to see by - even if it is as faint as a single firefly.
   A practitioner begins by knowing only the version of this Charm based on her aspect. When she learns two element katas for a different aspect, however, she can also use the form of Apprentice Gesture for that new element. A martial artist can also learn other versions of the Apprentice Gesture as separate Charms. A character can use only one version at a time.</description>

            <description>The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is mainly practiced by criminal organizations such as its inventor, the Five Shade Association (see pp. 29-30). For centuries, its practitioners have brought eternal peace to "impossible to kill" targets - and eternal frustration to the law-enforcement officials trying to round them up. Through yoga-like meditation and a combination of arcane gestures and endlessly repeated katas, students learn to channel elemental Essences through their hands and chakras. At the root (or, as stylists like to call it, the palm) of these powers lies an understanding of quiet violence and the art of assassination. Unfolding outward from that, each finger of the shadow hand specializes in the tricks and traps of one of Creation's elements. The true power of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style comes from mastering one's natural element, then decoding the secrets of the others to round out the discipline.
   The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is seldom taught by a single sifu. There is usually a group involved, since different practitioners favor different elements and, therefore, different training methods. In the Five Shade Association, each practitioner favors one element, either because of Terrestrial Exaltation or as part of a patron elemental's gift of Essence-manipulation. (Practitioners who wouldn't normally have a native element, such as Solars or the majority of mortal Essence-wielders, always find that they tend more toward one than the others. In such cases, the player should choose whichever element she thinks best fits her character's personality and declare that the character's "aspect". If a character doesn't have an elemental aspect before learning this style, she will once she learns the Apprentice Gesture. That affinity will apply to learning other elementally aspected martial arts styles too).
• Air-associated training usually involves elevation and silence. Although sifus use different methods, all agree on these points: If a trainee's feet touch the ground, she has failed, and when her exercises are done, even the most perceptive listeners should have heard nothing but the wind. Earth-aligned dojos are often built within hidden caves, where masked students strive to understand the subtlety of human postures and the power of anonymous unity. Each student must learn to identify her anonymous fellows' personalities and agendas despite their hidden faces. Just as importantly, they must recognize each other when they aren't garbed as assassins.
• A Shadow Hand martial artist aspected toward Fire trains to move in darkness and make swift, surprise attacks. His training involves fighting blindfolded and trying to slice squares of silk or small sticks into pieces before they fall to the ground.
• Water-aspected training often takes place in swamps and sewers. Students are expected to master their finer sensibilities and perform normally revolting tasks without flinching. A favorite test is for students to hold a handstand with their faces inches from stinking sludge while wearing white socks - the aim being for both socks to remain clean when the sifu returns.
• Wood-followers use trickery and misdirection. Sifus bid their charges to study particularly sly and elusive animals and imitate their postures and forms of movement. They also study the tricks of coloration, motion and stillness by which these creatures confuse their natural predators.
       Practitioners refer to the elements not by their most widely used names, but by specific pseudonyms. Earth is generally called the Mountain; Air, the Breeze; Water, the Mist; Fire, the Smoke; and Wood, the Forgotten.
   Sifus of the style note that certain elements associate with each other. The two katas of Smoke, for example, both include Breeze as a secondary element, whereas neither involves Mist. Breeze, they conjecture, is the natural ally of Smoke - Mist, its natural enemy. The elements seem to go in a cycle of destruction, with Smoke burning the Forgotten, which covers the Mountain, which blocks the Breeze, which dispels the Mist, which, again, drowns the Smoke. On the other hand, the Forgotten refreshes the Breeze, which fans the Smoke, which renews the Mountain, which channels the Mist, which feeds the Forgotten. These cycles reveal the flows and transformations of elemental Essence.
   The advanced Charms for each element involve a degree of usurpation or assimilation of the next element in the creative cycle. Mist usurps the poisoning natural to Wood. The Mountain katas include the fluidity and mutability of Water. Smoke takes on the darkness, secrecy and stasis of Earth. Breeze merges the intangibility of Air with the evanescence of Fire. The Forgotten completes the cycle by usurping the invisibility of Air.
   The style's Charm tree has a peculiar structure. First, practitioners learn the Apprentice and Adept Gestures for their own element. Next, in no particular order, they can learn the style's Form-type Charm and two element katas. Each kata combines the character's personal elemental aspect (using the appropriate [Element] Adept Gesture as a prerequisite) with two other elements. Once the character knows these three Charms, she can learn the style's terminal Charm. Once she knows Fivefold Shadow Hand Form, she can then learn katas based on other elements. (The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion).

        <description>Practitioners of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style believe that one special quality expresses the nature of each element. The martial artist invokes that special quality by pressing the relevant fingers of both hands together. As long as he keeps those fingers touching, he may use his element's characteristic power:
• Breeze: Quiet as the air, the martial artist's passage stirs no noise at all as long as he keeps his two littlest fingers pressed together at the tips. While he is being stealthy, observers take an external penalty equal to one-half his Martial Arts (rounded up for Exalts, rounded down for heroic mortals) to any attempts to notice him. If the only sense with which they could detect him is hearing, the other characters receive a penalty equal to his entire Martial Arts score.
• The Forgotten: Fading into the background and making sure to be wherever highly visible activity is not, the martial artist touches one thumb to the other. Awareness rolls made to see him suffer an external penalty. If he is in an area with lots of clutter or distractions, such as a crowd or a forest, this penalty can be -1 or even -2 for especially dense areas. If he stands very still, the penalty is -1. The two penalties can stack.
• Mist: Concentrating to thin his blood, the martial artist touches his two ring fingers together. He may add his Martial Arts in successes to all his (Stamina + Resistance) rolls to withstand the effects of poison.
• Mountain: Middle fingers pressed together, the character focuses on unity with his fellows. He knows the intended actions of everyone within 10 yards who uses either the Mountain Adept Gesture or the Mountain Apprentice Gesture, as if everyone had spoken them aloud. The characters intuitively know each other's actions, and a group that's trained together has a good idea of the reasons behind them.
• Smoke: As long as his index fingers are together when Join Battle would normally be rolled, the character may ignore the roll and instead act on tick 0, no matter what anyone else's player rolls. This gesture does not protect the character against unexpected attacks.
   A Fivefold Shadow Hand practitioner initially learns the Adept Gesture for his favored element. A character can also learn the Adept Gestures for other elements as separate Charms, if he knows the corresponding Apprentice Gesture. A character can use only one form of Adept Gesture at a time.</description>

Her substance is more in tune with the elemental energies of Creation. As a result, not only can she perceive and interact with dematerialized elementals, but they can perceive and interact with her.

(The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion). When the student learns two katas based on an element, she can use the Apprentice Gesture of that element as well. Nothing prevents a martial artist from learning the Apprentice Gesture of another element before then, except a desire to avoid wasted effort. (Sorry, but players don't get back the experience points they spend on Gesture Charms once the character reaches the point where she would gain them anyway). A character aspected to one element must pay a one-mote surcharge to use Charms (or sub-forms of Charms) aspected to a different element, unless she's a Dragon-Blood aspected to Water.
       Many of the advanced Charms have an aspect of illu-sion or deception. They are not obvious at the time (which would defeat the purpose of the illusion) but witnesses can figure out later that the assassin did something magical. An alert person might notice and remember the peculiar way the martial artist positioned his hands and watch for that gesture in the future.
   Weapons and Armor: The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style as a whole lacks form weapons. Instead, followers of different elements use different form weapons: Smoke uses the short sword, the Forgotten uses the tonfa, the Mountain uses rope weapons, the Breeze uses the shuriken, and Mist uses the knife. When a martial artist learns a kata that traditionally belongs to another element [see the "The Share-(Element) Keyword" sidebar, p. 77], she also learns the usage of that element's favored weapon and can thenceforth use it with the style's Charms as well as the weapon of her favored element.
       Most martial artists who use the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style don't bother to use weapons at all, though. Almost every Charm past (Element) Apprentice Gesture requires the martial artist to keep both hands together as long as she invokes it, and it's easier for practitioners who are trying to stay unnoticed to do so if they're not carrying obviously dangerous items. Those who do use and carry weapons, have probably mastered the Shadow Palm Invocation. In some circles, merely carrying a weapon can lead some people to treat the character with the utmost respect, believing that she has learned the whole style.

        <description>So stealthy he's nearly invisible, the martial artist gently touches his littlest fingers to each other and touches the thumb and index finger of one hand to index and thumb (respectively) of the other hand, encouraging his foes' eyes and ears to sense only a passing breeze. As long as he keeps his fingers in that position, anyone with a (Perception + Essence) score that is not higher than the character's Martial Arts score fails to realize that he's not just a breath of air. Observers may also spend two Willpower to realize that there is not, in fact, a wind, but a martial artist in their midst, but they need some reason to suspect an intruder.
   If the character is pointed out, or if he takes any non-movement actions while he is the wind, the illusion falls.</description>

            <name>Fivefold Shadow Hand Style</name>
            <description>The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is mainly practiced by criminal organizations such as its inventor, the Five Shade Association (see pp. 29-30). For centuries, its practitioners have brought eternal peace to "impossible to kill" targets - and eternal frustration to the law-enforcement officials trying to round them up. Through yoga-like meditation and a combination of arcane gestures and endlessly repeated katas, students learn to channel elemental Essences through their hands and chakras. At the root (or, as stylists like to call it, the palm) of these powers lies an understanding of quiet violence and the art of assassination. Unfolding outward from that, each finger of the shadow hand specializes in the tricks and traps of one of Creation's elements. The true power of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style comes from mastering one's natural element, then decoding the secrets of the others to round out the discipline.
   The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is seldom taught by a single sifu. There is usually a group involved, since different practitioners favor different elements and, therefore, different training methods. In the Five Shade Association, each practitioner favors one element, either because of Terrestrial Exaltation or as part of a patron elemental's gift of Essence-manipulation. (Practitioners who wouldn't normally have a native element, such as Solars or the majority of mortal Essence-wielders, always find that they tend more toward one than the others. In such cases, the player should choose whichever element she thinks best fits her character's personality and declare that the character's "aspect". If a character doesn't have an elemental aspect before learning this style, she will once she learns the Apprentice Gesture. That affinity will apply to learning other elementally aspected martial arts styles too).
• Air-associated training usually involves elevation and silence. Although sifus use different methods, all agree on these points: If a trainee's feet touch the ground, she has failed, and when her exercises are done, even the most perceptive listeners should have heard nothing but the wind. Earth-aligned dojos are often built within hidden caves, where masked students strive to understand the subtlety of human postures and the power of anonymous unity. Each student must learn to identify her anonymous fellows' personalities and agendas despite their hidden faces. Just as importantly, they must recognize each other when they aren't garbed as assassins.
• A Shadow Hand martial artist aspected toward Fire trains to move in darkness and make swift, surprise attacks. His training involves fighting blindfolded and trying to slice squares of silk or small sticks into pieces before they fall to the ground.
• Water-aspected training often takes place in swamps and sewers. Students are expected to master their finer sensibilities and perform normally revolting tasks without flinching. A favorite test is for students to hold a handstand with their faces inches from stinking sludge while wearing white socks - the aim being for both socks to remain clean when the sifu returns.
• Wood-followers use trickery and misdirection. Sifus bid their charges to study particularly sly and elusive animals and imitate their postures and forms of movement. They also study the tricks of coloration, motion and stillness by which these creatures confuse their natural predators.
       Practitioners refer to the elements not by their most widely used names, but by specific pseudonyms. Earth is generally called the Mountain; Air, the Breeze; Water, the Mist; Fire, the Smoke; and Wood, the Forgotten.
   Sifus of the style note that certain elements associate with each other. The two katas of Smoke, for example, both include Breeze as a secondary element, whereas neither involves Mist. Breeze, they conjecture, is the natural ally of Smoke - Mist, its natural enemy. The elements seem to go in a cycle of destruction, with Smoke burning the Forgotten, which covers the Mountain, which blocks the Breeze, which dispels the Mist, which, again, drowns the Smoke. On the other hand, the Forgotten refreshes the Breeze, which fans the Smoke, which renews the Mountain, which channels the Mist, which feeds the Forgotten. These cycles reveal the flows and transformations of elemental Essence.
   The advanced Charms for each element involve a degree of usurpation or assimilation of the next element in the creative cycle. Mist usurps the poisoning natural to Wood. The Mountain katas include the fluidity and mutability of Water. Smoke takes on the darkness, secrecy and stasis of Earth. Breeze merges the intangibility of Air with the evanescence of Fire. The Forgotten completes the cycle by usurping the invisibility of Air.
   The style's Charm tree has a peculiar structure. First, practitioners learn the Apprentice and Adept Gestures for their own element. Next, in no particular order, they can learn the style's Form-type Charm and two element katas. Each kata combines the character's personal elemental aspect (using the appropriate [Element] Adept Gesture as a prerequisite) with two other elements. Once the character knows these three Charms, she can learn the style's terminal Charm. Once she knows Fivefold Shadow Hand Form, she can then learn katas based on other elements. (The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion). When the student learns two katas based on an element, she can use the Apprentice Gesture of that element as well. Nothing prevents a martial artist from learning the Apprentice Gesture of another element before then, except a desire to avoid wasted effort. (Sorry, but players don't get back the experience points they spend on Gesture Charms once the character reaches the point where she would gain them anyway). A character aspected to one element must pay a one-mote surcharge to use Charms (or sub-forms of Charms) aspected to a different element, unless she's a Dragon-Blood aspected to Water.
       Many of the advanced Charms have an aspect of illu-sion or deception. They are not obvious at the time (which would defeat the purpose of the illusion) but witnesses can figure out later that the assassin did something magical. An alert person might notice and remember the peculiar way the martial artist positioned his hands and watch for that gesture in the future.
   Weapons and Armor: The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style as a whole lacks form weapons. Instead, followers of different elements use different form weapons: Smoke uses the short sword, the Forgotten uses the tonfa, the Mountain uses rope weapons, the Breeze uses the shuriken, and Mist uses the knife. When a martial artist learns a kata that traditionally belongs to another element [see the "The Share-(Element) Keyword" sidebar, p. 77], she also learns the usage of that element's favored weapon and can thenceforth use it with the style's Charms as well as the weapon of her favored element.
       Most martial artists who use the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style don't bother to use weapons at all, though. Almost every Charm past (Element) Apprentice Gesture requires the martial artist to keep both hands together as long as she invokes it, and it's easier for practitioners who are trying to stay unnoticed to do so if they're not carrying obviously dangerous items. Those who do use and carry weapons, have probably mastered the Shadow Palm Invocation.

        <description>Accidentally spotted, the martial artist flicks her smallest fingers together then touches the thumb and ring finger of one hand to the ring finger and thumb (respectively) of the other hand, while ducking around a corner. Those who saw her are confused into believing they saw a cat, a falling leaf or nothing at all. If the character can escape all searchers' sight for five actions, then those who don't have a (Wits + Essence) score higher than her Martial Arts forget they ever saw her.
   Forgotten Misty Breeze Kata can be used on a maximum number of targets equal to the character's Martial Arts. Any target may spend two Willpower to resist the Charm's effects. If a target is reminded of the particular person he saw, the illusion breaks. (The reminder must be specific and direct. For example, a guard might recall what he saw if his Dragon-Blooded superior says, "Don't you remember the masked girl who was standing right there a moment ago?" Without such a reminder, being told that he raised the alarm, or even spot-ting a shoe that the martial artist left behind, will only lead the confounded guard to further rationalizations).</description>

        <description>The character takes a deep breath, holding her ring fingers together and holding the middle and index fingers of one hand to the index and middle fingers (respectively) of the other. So doing, she focuses power carefully into her heart chakra and breathes out a fine, damp mist. For (her Essence x 10) yards, she creates an area of poor visibility (as detailed on p. 135 of Exalted) that lasts as long as she maintains her gesture.
   Characters aspected to Smoke or the Mountain who learn this kata tend to breathe out clouds of white smoke or finely ground dust rather than mist.</description>

        <description>Deliberately keeping her ring fingers together while touching the thumb and middle of one hand against the middle finger and thumb (respectively) of the other, the martial artist carefully imbibes a poison... and waits. She may use any Charms she wishes, including Mist Adept Gesture, to resist its effects. Once she has done so, she concentrates on her sacral chakra and impregnates her own tissues with the venom. Thereafter, as long as she continues the Forgotten Mountain Mist Kata, all of her bodily fluids are toxic, and anyone who has contact with them will suffer the effects of the same poison the character took.
   By the time the scene is over, the toxin has denatured, and the martial artist must take another dose if she wishes to continue using this Charm. If the poison would normally keep affecting her beyond the end of the scene, though, it still does so - she simply can't deliver it to others.</description>

            <name>Fivefold Shadow Hand Style</name>
            <description>The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is mainly practiced by criminal organizations such as its inventor, the Five Shade Association (see pp. 29-30). For centuries, its practitioners have brought eternal peace to "impossible to kill" targets - and eternal frustration to the law-enforcement officials trying to round them up. Through yoga-like meditation and a combination of arcane gestures and endlessly repeated katas, students learn to channel elemental Essences through their hands and chakras. At the root (or, as stylists like to call it, the palm) of these powers lies an understanding of quiet violence and the art of assassination. Unfolding outward from that, each finger of the shadow hand specializes in the tricks and traps of one of Creation's elements. The true power of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style comes from mastering one's natural element, then decoding the secrets of the others to round out the discipline.
   The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is seldom taught by a single sifu. There is usually a group involved, since different practitioners favor different elements and, therefore, different training methods. In the Five Shade Association, each practitioner favors one element, either because of Terrestrial Exaltation or as part of a patron elemental's gift of Essence-manipulation. (Practitioners who wouldn't normally have a native element, such as Solars or the majority of mortal Essence-wielders, always find that they tend more toward one than the others. In such cases, the player should choose whichever element she thinks best fits her character's personality and declare that the character's "aspect". If a character doesn't have an elemental aspect before learning this style, she will once she learns the Apprentice Gesture. That affinity will apply to learning other elementally aspected martial arts styles too).
• Air-associated training usually involves elevation and silence. Although sifus use different methods, all agree on these points: If a trainee's feet touch the ground, she has failed, and when her exercises are done, even the most perceptive listeners should have heard nothing but the wind. Earth-aligned dojos are often built within hidden caves, where masked students strive to understand the subtlety of human postures and the power of anonymous unity. Each student must learn to identify her anonymous fellows' personalities and agendas despite their hidden faces. Just as importantly, they must recognize each other when they aren't garbed as assassins.
• A Shadow Hand martial artist aspected toward Fire trains to move in darkness and make swift, surprise attacks. His training involves fighting blindfolded and trying to slice squares of silk or small sticks into pieces before they fall to the ground.
• Water-aspected training often takes place in swamps and sewers. Students are expected to master their finer sensibilities and perform normally revolting tasks without flinching. A favorite test is for students to hold a handstand with their faces inches from stinking sludge while wearing white socks - the aim being for both socks to remain clean when the sifu returns.
• Wood-followers use trickery and misdirection. Sifus bid their charges to study particularly sly and elusive animals and imitate their postures and forms of movement. They also study the tricks of coloration, motion and stillness by which these creatures confuse their natural predators.
       Practitioners refer to the elements not by their most widely used names, but by specific pseudonyms. Earth is generally called the Mountain; Air, the Breeze; Water, the Mist; Fire, the Smoke; and Wood, the Forgotten.
   Sifus of the style note that certain elements associate with each other. The two katas of Smoke, for example, both include Breeze as a secondary element, whereas neither involves Mist. Breeze, they conjecture, is the natural ally of Smoke - Mist, its natural enemy. The elements seem to go in a cycle of destruction, with Smoke burning the Forgotten, which covers the Mountain, which blocks the Breeze, which dispels the Mist, which, again, drowns the Smoke. On the other hand, the Forgotten refreshes the Breeze, which fans the Smoke, which renews the Mountain, which channels the Mist, which feeds the Forgotten. These cycles reveal the flows and transformations of elemental Essence.
   The advanced Charms for each element involve a degree of usurpation or assimilation of the next element in the creative cycle. Mist usurps the poisoning natural to Wood. The Mountain katas include the fluidity and mutability of Water. Smoke takes on the darkness, secrecy and stasis of Earth. Breeze merges the intangibility of Air with the evanescence of Fire. The Forgotten completes the cycle by usurping the invisibility of Air.
   The style's Charm tree has a peculiar structure. First, practitioners learn the Apprentice and Adept Gestures for their own element. Next, in no particular order, they can learn the style's Form-type Charm and two element katas. Each kata combines the character's personal elemental aspect (using the appropriate [Element] Adept Gesture as a prerequisite) with two other elements. Once the character knows these three Charms, she can learn the style's terminal Charm. Once she knows Fivefold Shadow Hand Form, she can then learn katas based on other elements. (The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion). When the student learns two katas based on an element, she can use the Apprentice Gesture of that element as well. Nothing prevents a martial artist from learning the Apprentice Gesture of another element before then, except a desire to avoid wasted effort. (Sorry, but players don't get back the experience points they spend on Gesture Charms once the character reaches the point where she would gain them anyway). A character aspected to one element must pay a one-mote surcharge to use Charms (or sub-forms of Charms) aspected to a different element, unless she's a Dragon-Blood aspected to Water.
       Many of the advanced Charms have an aspect of illu-sion or deception. They are not obvious at the time (which would defeat the purpose of the illusion) but witnesses can figure out later that the assassin did something magical. An alert person might notice and remember the peculiar way the martial artist positioned his hands and watch for that gesture in the future.
   Weapons and Armor: The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style as a whole lacks form weapons. Instead, followers of different elements use different form weapons: Smoke uses the short sword, the Forgotten uses the tonfa, the Mountain uses rope weapons, the Breeze uses the shuriken, and Mist uses the knife. When a martial artist learns a kata that traditionally belongs to another element [see the "The Share-(Element) Keyword" sidebar, p. 77], she also learns the usage of that element's favored weapon and can thenceforth use it with the style's Charms as well as the weapon of her favored element.
       Most martial artists who use the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style don't bother to use weapons at all, though. Almost every Charm past (Element) Apprentice Gesture requires the martial artist to keep both hands together as long as she invokes it, and it's easier for practitioners who are trying to stay unnoticed to do so if they're not carrying obviously dangerous items. Those who do use and carry weapons, have probably mastered the Shadow Palm Invocation. In some circles, merely carrying a weapon can lead some people to treat the character with the utmost respect, believing that she has learned the whole style.
   Characters cannot use this style while wearing armor.</description>

        <description>After she snaps her index fingers together and touches the middle and smallest fingers of one hand to the smallest and middle fingers (respectively) of the other hand, the martial artist's sudden strike leaves no evidence to betray her. After using the Smoky Mountain Breeze Kata, the character's next successful attack (using Martial Arts or anything else) within five actions inflicts the normal amount of pain and damage - but no wounds whatsoever, as the stability of Earth holds the victim's body together. No amount of examination will determine what hurt the target as long as the investigator works from the bodily evidence alone. Attempts to heal the target using mundane Medicine suffer a -2 external penalty because the healer can't find what's damaged.</description>

        <description>After holding his index fingers together and touching the littlest finger and thumb of one hand to the thumb and littlest finger (respectively) of the other, the martial artist leaps forward to deliver a deadly looking punch, kick or strike of his weapon... that misses! The inept assassin then flees. Yet, things are not what they seem.
   The character's first successful attack within five actions after this Charm's invocation will not knock the target back or stun him. Any onlooker whose (Perception + Essence) score is lower than the attacker's Martial Arts sees the attacker miss. Only at the end of the scene will everyone (including the target himself) realize that he was hit. Even if the target should take wound penalties, the target will not suffer any of the required effects until then. Effectively, the damage is delayed until the end of the scene... or someone points out what really happened.
   Observers who spend two Willpower, and the martial artist himself, realize the character struck a blow that should have inflicted damage. Once someone explicitly points this out, everyone else realizes this too and the damage manifests - which means that a victim can be dead yet keep walking and talking until someone points out that he was hit.
   Since The Unexpected Death has a continuing effect, a martial artist can employ some other Charm as part of his actual attack on his target.</description>

        <description>Those who practice the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style rightly pride themselves on their brilliant and unexpected disguises. With her thumbs, pressed firmly together and the ring finger and smallest finger of one hand touching the smallest and ring finger (respectively) of the other, the martial artist may remove any penalties she takes to Larceny disguise rolls for not having props or for disguising herself as something absurd. She cannot hide anything on her person while using this Charm, and the player must make the disguise roll as normal (see Exalted, p. 128). People whose players succeed on the normal disguise-penetrating check will not be fooled, and neither will anyone whose (Perception + Essence) is higher than the character's Martial Arts.
   The Misty Forgotten Breeze Kata cannot mask the character as anything smaller than a cat or larger than a moose, but within those parameters, she can pretend to be anything from an animal to a coat rack. She cannot, however, become any specific thing - for example, her enemy's favorite pet or the Scarlet Empress's personal coat rack. Also, if anyone tries to interact with her in the capacity she has assumed - for example, petting her or putting his coat on her - then the martial artist must spend a Willpower point, or the illusion will fall.
   The illusion automatically breaks if the character fails to maintain her gesture, or if someone points out that the coat rack is actually a person. It also fails if the character takes any actions that her chosen disguise couldn't do. For instance, pets don't draw weapons (usually), and coat racks don't walk around. Observers may spend two Willpower to resist the illusion, if they have some reason to doubt it.</description>

That affinity will apply to learning other elementally aspected martial arts styles too).
• Air-associated training usually involves elevation and silence. Although sifus use different methods, all agree on these points: If a trainee's feet touch the ground, she has failed, and when her exercises are done, even the most perceptive listeners should have heard nothing but the wind. Earth-aligned dojos are often built within hidden caves, where masked students strive to understand the subtlety of human postures and the power of anonymous unity. Each student must learn to identify her anonymous fellows' personalities and agendas despite their hidden faces. Just as importantly, they must recognize each other when they aren't garbed as assassins.
• A Shadow Hand martial artist aspected toward Fire trains to move in darkness and make swift, surprise attacks. His training involves fighting blindfolded and trying to slice squares of silk or small sticks into pieces before they fall to the ground.
• Water-aspected training often takes place in swamps and sewers. Students are expected to master their finer sensibilities and perform normally revolting tasks without flinching. A favorite test is for students to hold a handstand with their faces inches from stinking sludge while wearing white socks - the aim being for both socks to remain clean when the sifu returns.
• Wood-followers use trickery and misdirection. Sifus bid their charges to study particularly sly and elusive animals and imitate their postures and forms of movement. They also study the tricks of coloration, motion and stillness by which these creatures confuse their natural predators.
       Practitioners refer to the elements not by their most widely used names, but by specific pseudonyms. Earth is generally called the Mountain; Air, the Breeze; Water, the Mist; Fire, the Smoke; and Wood, the Forgotten.
   Sifus of the style note that certain elements associate with each other. The two katas of Smoke, for example, both include Breeze as a secondary element, whereas neither involves Mist. Breeze, they conjecture, is the natural ally of Smoke - Mist, its natural enemy. The elements seem to go in a cycle of destruction, with Smoke burning the Forgotten, which covers the Mountain, which blocks the Breeze, which dispels the Mist, which, again, drowns the Smoke. On the other hand, the Forgotten refreshes the Breeze, which fans the Smoke, which renews the Mountain, which channels the Mist, which feeds the Forgotten. These cycles reveal the flows and transformations of elemental Essence.
   The advanced Charms for each element involve a degree of usurpation or assimilation of the next element in the creative cycle. Mist usurps the poisoning natural to Wood. The Mountain katas include the fluidity and mutability of Water. Smoke takes on the darkness, secrecy and stasis of Earth. Breeze merges the intangibility of Air with the evanescence of Fire. The Forgotten completes the cycle by usurping the invisibility of Air.
   The style's Charm tree has a peculiar structure. First, practitioners learn the Apprentice and Adept Gestures for their own element. Next, in no particular order, they can learn the style's Form-type Charm and two element katas. Each kata combines the character's personal elemental aspect (using the appropriate [Element] Adept Gesture as a prerequisite) with two other elements. Once the character knows these three Charms, she can learn the style's terminal Charm. Once she knows Fivefold Shadow Hand Form, she can then learn katas based on other elements. (The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion). When the student learns two katas based on an element, she can use the Apprentice Gesture of that element as well. Nothing prevents a martial artist from learning the Apprentice Gesture of another element before then, except a desire to avoid wasted effort. (Sorry, but players don't get back the experience points they spend on Gesture Charms once the character reaches the point where she would gain them anyway). A character aspected to one element must pay a one-mote surcharge to use Charms (or sub-forms of Charms) aspected to a different element, unless she's a Dragon-Blood aspected to Water.
       Many of the advanced Charms have an aspect of illu-sion or deception. They are not obvious at the time (which would defeat the purpose of the illusion) but witnesses can figure out later that the assassin did something magical. An alert person might notice and remember the peculiar way the martial artist positioned his hands and watch for that gesture in the future.
   Weapons and Armor: The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style as a whole lacks form weapons. Instead, followers of different elements use different form weapons: Smoke uses the short sword, the Forgotten uses the tonfa, the Mountain uses rope weapons, the Breeze uses the shuriken, and Mist uses the knife. When a martial artist learns a kata that traditionally belongs to another element [see the "The Share-(Element) Keyword" sidebar, p. 77], she also learns the usage of that element's favored weapon and can thenceforth use it with the style's Charms as well as the weapon of her favored element.
       Most martial artists who use the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style don't bother to use weapons at all, though. Almost every Charm past (Element) Apprentice Gesture requires the martial artist to keep both hands together as long as she invokes it, and it's easier for practitioners who are trying to stay unnoticed to do so if they're not carrying obviously dangerous items. Those who do use and carry weapons, have probably mastered the Shadow Palm Invocation. In some circles, merely carrying a weapon can lead some people to treat the character with the utmost respect, believing that she has learned the whole style.

        <description>Thumbs come together and middle and smallest fingers of one hand touch the smallest and middle fingers (respectively) of the other as the martial artist dances back from her opponent. If her opponent "seems to" hit her within five actions while she is using this Charm, then it turns out that she was really just far too quick and clever to have actually been hit. Unless her opponent has a higher (Wits + Essence) than her Martial Arts, he actually hit something else.
   The character does not pick the object that is confused for her, and it must be dramatically unimportant, mundane, moveable and at least a yard long. Suitable objects include chairs, logs, barrels or even watermelons with chopsticks for arms and legs. Cluttered places might give targets of this Charm an external penalty to their (Wits + Essence) total ranging from -1 to -3. In a forest at night, for instance, every shrub and tree-branch can look like an assassin poised to strike.</description>

            <description>The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is mainly practiced by criminal organizations such as its inventor, the Five Shade Association (see pp. 29-30). For centuries, its practitioners have brought eternal peace to "impossible to kill" targets - and eternal frustration to the law-enforcement officials trying to round them up. Through yoga-like meditation and a combination of arcane gestures and endlessly repeated katas, students learn to channel elemental Essences through their hands and chakras. At the root (or, as stylists like to call it, the palm) of these powers lies an understanding of quiet violence and the art of assassination. Unfolding outward from that, each finger of the shadow hand specializes in the tricks and traps of one of Creation's elements. The true power of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style comes from mastering one's natural element, then decoding the secrets of the others to round out the discipline.
   The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style is seldom taught by a single sifu. There is usually a group involved, since different practitioners favor different elements and, therefore, different training methods. In the Five Shade Association, each practitioner favors one element, either because of Terrestrial Exaltation or as part of a patron elemental's gift of Essence-manipulation. (Practitioners who wouldn't normally have a native element, such as Solars or the majority of mortal Essence-wielders, always find that they tend more toward one than the others. In such cases, the player should choose whichever element she thinks best fits her character's personality and declare that the character's "aspect". If a character doesn't have an elemental aspect before learning this style, she will once she learns the Apprentice Gesture.

        <description>Adopting a posture of ease and disregard - and touching her middle fingers together while the index and smallest fingers of one hand touch the smallest and index fingers (respectively) of the other - the character directs the attention of her companions to a pretty sunset or a shocking new rumor, rather than what she doesn't want them to notice. As long as her hands remain in that position and none of those watching have a (Perception + Essence) greater than the character's Martial Arts, no one will consider the object or event she is attempting to obscure worth their attention. With this Charm, the martial artist may blithely carry a firedust bomb to a formal dinner in her satchel or show her lockpicks to the guards outside her cell. If she does, although observers can see the affected article, they won't feel threatened by it unless either they spend two Willpower, the character uses the item to do something unfortunate to them, or its dangers are clearly pointed out.</description>

        <description>Five Shade gangsters aligned to the Mountain favor a mustard-yellow wrap that thoroughly covers the face, but anyone who learns the Smoky Mist Mountain Kata may choose the anonymous uniform she adopts when she buys it. That uniform - with an identity-concealing mask and weapon to go with it - is banished Elsewhere. When the character holds her middle fingers together and touches the index and ring fingers of one hand to the ring and index fingers (respectively) of the other, her current clothing is sent Elsewhere and her uniform appears on her body in its place. Invoking this Charm again calls back her normal outfit just as quickly, and puts her unrecognizable clothing back where it came from. When Mountain-aspected assassins gather for a "job", apparent strangers are suddenly replaced by a tightly coordinated team of identically garbed martial artists.</description>

• Water-aspected training often takes place in swamps and sewers. Students are expected to master their finer sensibilities and perform normally revolting tasks without flinching. A favorite test is for students to hold a handstand with their faces inches from stinking sludge while wearing white socks - the aim being for both socks to remain clean when the sifu returns.
• Wood-followers use trickery and misdirection. Sifus bid their charges to study particularly sly and elusive animals and imitate their postures and forms of movement. They also study the tricks of coloration, motion and stillness by which these creatures confuse their natural predators.
       Practitioners refer to the elements not by their most widely used names, but by specific pseudonyms. Earth is generally called the Mountain; Air, the Breeze; Water, the Mist; Fire, the Smoke; and Wood, the Forgotten.
   Sifus of the style note that certain elements associate with each other. The two katas of Smoke, for example, both include Breeze as a secondary element, whereas neither involves Mist. Breeze, they conjecture, is the natural ally of Smoke - Mist, its natural enemy. The elements seem to go in a cycle of destruction, with Smoke burning the Forgotten, which covers the Mountain, which blocks the Breeze, which dispels the Mist, which, again, drowns the Smoke. On the other hand, the Forgotten refreshes the Breeze, which fans the Smoke, which renews the Mountain, which channels the Mist, which feeds the Forgotten. These cycles reveal the flows and transformations of elemental Essence.
   The advanced Charms for each element involve a degree of usurpation or assimilation of the next element in the creative cycle. Mist usurps the poisoning natural to Wood. The Mountain katas include the fluidity and mutability of Water. Smoke takes on the darkness, secrecy and stasis of Earth. Breeze merges the intangibility of Air with the evanescence of Fire. The Forgotten completes the cycle by usurping the invisibility of Air.
   The style's Charm tree has a peculiar structure. First, practitioners learn the Apprentice and Adept Gestures for their own element. Next, in no particular order, they can learn the style's Form-type Charm and two element katas. Each kata combines the character's personal elemental aspect (using the appropriate [Element] Adept Gesture as a prerequisite) with two other elements. Once the character knows these three Charms, she can learn the style's terminal Charm. Once she knows Fivefold Shadow Hand Form, she can then learn katas based on other elements. (The Adept Gesture prerequisites for the katas apply only to students of the listed elemental affinity. The Fivefold Shadow Hand Form prerequisite for students of a different affinity is not listed with the katas, so as to forestall confusion). When the student learns two katas based on an element, she can use the Apprentice Gesture of that element as well. Nothing prevents a martial artist from learning the Apprentice Gesture of another element before then, except a desire to avoid wasted effort. (Sorry, but players don't get back the experience points they spend on Gesture Charms once the character reaches the point where she would gain them anyway). A character aspected to one element must pay a one-mote surcharge to use Charms (or sub-forms of Charms) aspected to a different element, unless she's a Dragon-Blood aspected to Water.
       Many of the advanced Charms have an aspect of illu-sion or deception. They are not obvious at the time (which would defeat the purpose of the illusion) but witnesses can figure out later that the assassin did something magical. An alert person might notice and remember the peculiar way the martial artist positioned his hands and watch for that gesture in the future.
   Weapons and Armor: The Fivefold Shadow Hand Style as a whole lacks form weapons. Instead, followers of different elements use different form weapons: Smoke uses the short sword, the Forgotten uses the tonfa, the Mountain uses rope weapons, the Breeze uses the shuriken, and Mist uses the knife. When a martial artist learns a kata that traditionally belongs to another element [see the "The Share-(Element) Keyword" sidebar, p. 77], she also learns the usage of that element's favored weapon and can thenceforth use it with the style's Charms as well as the weapon of her favored element.
       Most martial artists who use the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style don't bother to use weapons at all, though. Almost every Charm past (Element) Apprentice Gesture requires the martial artist to keep both hands together as long as she invokes it, and it's easier for practitioners who are trying to stay unnoticed to do so if they're not carrying obviously dangerous items. Those who do use and carry weapons, have probably mastered the Shadow Palm Invocation. In some circles, merely carrying a weapon can lead some people to treat the character with the utmost respect, believing that she has learned the whole style.
   Characters cannot use this style while wearing armor.</description>

        <description>The Adept Gestures and katas of the Fivefold Shadow Hand Style are difficult to perform subtly or quickly. Moreover, having both hands occupied - whether briefly or for minutes at a time - can be a real problem for a martial artist. Calling the shadows of one hand's fingers to serve the function of the other, a character with the Shadow Palm Invocation simply folds the fingers she uses to invoke the elements down into the palm of one hand. All Charms of this style but the Form-type Charm are affected; each Charm becomes reflexive, and the character no longer has to maintain a gesture or employ both hands to use them.
   Characters who know a lot about this style may specifically watch a practitioner to see if she is using its Charms, even in this difficult-to-spot way. In such a case, the martial artist's player should roll (Dexterity + Larceny), opposed by the watcher's (Perception + Investigation), if she wishes to conceal the fact that one of her hands is busy.</description>

            <description>The mighty Anklok disdained the practice of most martial arts, preferring to rely on their raw might, personal prowess and the gifts of their Paths of Draconic Enlightenment to demonstrate their devotion to the Unconquered Sun. A few styles, however, attracted their favorable regard and enjoyed widespread practice among their kind. Generally, these styles were either particularly suited to their nature or were of special religious significance. Flame and Stone Style is among the former. Developed by an Anklok warrior whose soul has long since been lost to destruction or savagery, it epitomizes the simple brutality and purity of the Desert Dragons.
   In the Second Age, Flame and Stone Style has few remaining adherents. It is practiced occasionally in Yu-Shan, but the civilized restrictions of Heaven make it difficult for the Dragon Kings to worship the Unconquered Sun with their customary unrestrained violence and zeal. A few hardy survivors at Scale Crest Island (see the Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 20) continue to pass on its forms from lifetime to lifetime.
   Its largest community of practitioners, however, is a group of enlightened mortal and Dragon-Blooded bandits living on a table mesa two hundred miles east of Gem. Ninety years ago, a group of raiders led by a Terrestrial outcaste named Saman Dar-Al located an ancient, abandoned Anklok settlement on the mesa whose walls were inscribed with carvings and paintings depicting the forms of a strange, inhuman martial art. Dar-Al soon lost his interest in banditry, and devoted himself to studying these prehuman ruins. A loose group of archaeologists, ascetics, dervishes and hangers-on has gathered at the site in the years since, still occasionally resorting to banditry to sustain itself. Gem is aware of the community, but has been unable to devote the resources to root it out due to the large number of powerful Terrestrial martial artists in residence.
   This style is aspected toward the element of fire.
   Weapons and Armor: Flame and Stone Style is fully compatible with armor and is traditionally practiced with a shield. Several of its Charms are designed to employ the tail strike of the Anklok (see the Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 37). Attacks with clubs and crystal warclubs are considered to be equivalent to Anklok tail strikes and unarmed attacks for the purposes of Charms of this style.
   Complementary Abilities: To survive the brutal training regimens of this style, practitioners must possess Resistance 2.</description>

        <description>Because the Anklok are known for their power rather than speed, they find it expedient to force opponents to stop moving so that events can more quickly reach their natural conclusion. Utilizing his great bulk and power, the martial artist whirls into a strike directed at an opponent's legs. If an unarmed attack supplemented by this Charm successfully strikes its target, the target suffers automatic knock-down and cannot rise until his DV has refreshed itself twice.</description>

        <description>Forethought coupled with conviction is the mark of a truly enlightened warrior. It is traditional for students of this style to learn how to imbue certainty into their most powerful blows by studying the volcanoes of the uttermost South. These ancient mountains give ample warning of their intent, as the martial artist does when he readies a powerful blow. Yet, by the time they begin to rumble and send up great plumes of smoke, it's usually too late. Fire rains down in torrents too great to be avoided or outrun. So it is with the martial artist.
   This Charm may enhance any unarmed fierce blows the character delivers, removing the -1 external penalty associated with such attacks.</description>

        <description>Martial artists meditate upon rock formations in the deserts near the Elemental Pole of Fire when attempting to learn this technique. The sun rises and heats the rock throughout the day, until the rock radiates sufficient heat to sear the flesh, forcing the martial artist to leap away. He watches as it grows hotter still, attaining temperatures that would kill any mere mortal. And yet, when the sun sets, the rock remains and is no worse for its ordeal.
   When Essence is channeled to emulate the lesson of the sun and the stone, the martial artist raises his natural lethal and bashing soak totals by an amount equal to his Essence, plus one for each point of onslaught penalty to which he is currently subject.</description>

        <description>As they approach mastery, Flame and Stone practitioners begin practicing while unclothed or wearing only simple loincloths. They trek across the open desert until they find a likely stone outcropping, then deliver blow after blow to the stones to toughen their body. As the day's training progresses, sharp flakes and shards of stone litter the ground. The martial artist does not heed them any more than the brutal punishment applied to his fists or the way the sun bakes his flesh. His agony is a celebration of the fire of the sun and the rock of the desert. No lesser trauma can daunt him thereafter.
   This Charm reduces the post-soak damage of an attack by one die. This effect may explicitly lower an attack's damage to below the attacker's minimum damage rating, but not to less than zero dice.</description>

            <description>The mighty Anklok disdained the practice of most martial arts, preferring to rely on their raw might, personal prowess and the gifts of their Paths of Draconic Enlightenment to demonstrate their devotion to the Unconquered Sun. A few styles, however, attracted their favorable regard and enjoyed widespread practice among their kind. Generally, these styles were either particularly suited to their nature or were of special religious significance. Flame and Stone Style is among the former. Developed by an Anklok warrior whose soul has long since been lost to destruction or savagery, it epitomizes the simple brutality and purity of the Desert Dragons.
   In the Second Age, Flame and Stone Style has few remaining adherents. It is practiced occasionally in Yu-Shan, but the civilized restrictions of Heaven make it difficult for the Dragon Kings to worship the Unconquered Sun with their customary unrestrained violence and zeal. A few hardy survivors at Scale Crest Island (see the Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 20) continue to pass on its forms from lifetime to lifetime.
   Its largest community of practitioners, however, is a group of enlightened mortal and Dragon-Blooded bandits living on a table mesa two hundred miles east of Gem. Ninety years ago, a group of raiders led by a Terrestrial outcaste named Saman Dar-Al located an ancient, abandoned Anklok settlement on the mesa whose walls were inscribed with carvings and paintings depicting the forms of a strange, inhuman martial art. Dar-Al soon lost his interest in banditry, and devoted himself to studying these prehuman ruins. A loose group of archaeologists, ascetics, dervishes and hangers-on has gathered at the site in the years since, still occasionally resorting to banditry to sustain itself. Gem is aware of the community, but has been unable to devote the resources to root it out due to the large number of powerful Terrestrial martial artists in residence.
   This style is aspected toward the element of fire.
   Weapons and Armor: Flame and Stone Style is fully compatible with armor and is traditionally practiced with a shield. Several of its Charms are designed to employ the tail strike of the Anklok (see the Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 37). Attacks with clubs and crystal warclubs are considered to be equivalent to Anklok tail strikes and unarmed attacks for the purposes of Charms of this style.

        <description>Masters of the Flame and Stone Style do not always kill, but they never let an opponent walk away without some lasting mark of the battle. For that matter, they rarely leave opponents capable of walking away. This Charm supplements a tail strike. If it inflicts at least two levels of damage, the martial artist breaks one of the opponent's limbs. (See Exalted, p. 152; treat as an amputation effect that does not actually sever the limb in question.) Essence inflames this terrible wound, adding one to the target's wound penalties. Multiple limbs may be broken with successive attacks, but wound penalty inflictions do not stack.</description>

            <description>At a glance, the hulking bodies of the Western Dragon Kings seem ill suited to the practice of most forms of martial arts. Nothing could be further from the truth, though being underestimated generally pleases the deceptive nature of the Sea Hunters. The sound of his bones snapping is generally an opponent's first indication of how badly he has misjudged the Mosok.
       Practitioners of the Black Tide Style study the currents of the deep ocean, the habits of seagoing predators and the way the light of the Unconquered Sun dances on the surface of the waves. As a fight-ing style designed for use in water, its masters learn to let their environment be their grace, even as it slows and entraps opponents.
       Yet, aside from a few civilized practitioners on Scale Crest Isle, this martial art has unfortunately passed out of the hands of its creators and now primarily rests in the clutches of their enemies. While some few outcaste schools hand down the secrets of Black Tide Style from master to student, its primary practitioners in the Age of Sorrows are hated Lintha villains.
   This style is aspected toward the element  of water.
   Weapons and Armor: Black Tide Style may only be used with light armor. While traditionally practiced with bare hands or claws, it also considers attacks made with tridents (see below) to be equivalent to unarmed attacks.

        <description>Water is a fickle medium in which to fight for one's life. It lends grace to those born to it, while pushing against every effort of those who have tied their fate to the land. Executing a quick series of patterned guarding motions, the martial artist agitates the water around him so that it pushes against incoming blows, blunting their force. This Charm grants +2L/4B armored soak against one attack.</description>

        <description>The world below the waves is less forgiving than the one above. Demonstrating contempt, the martial artist releases an opponent's blood to the wild currents; whether his opponent then bleeds out or attracts a hungry siaka is not the fighter's concern. This Charm requires an unarmed attack that inflicts lethal damage. (With their sharp claws, this requirement presents no trouble for the Mosok; other practitioners could encounter some difficulty meeting it.) If damage is inflicted, the wound bleeds profusely. Exalts bleed from this wound as a mortal, and are even capable of bleeding to death if the wound is not stanched. Wounds inflicted on mortals impose a -2 external penalty on attempts to stanch them.</description>

        <description>The martial artist flexes his muscles, then steps into an intricate, ongoing kata. His hands send ripples through the air around him, and his body weaves forward as though it were the depths of the sea. The anima banner of the Exalt liquefies, taking on the form of luminous water. Practitioners who do not possess an anima banner must pay two extra motes to invoke this Charm, forcing the air to literally liquefy around them in response to their Essence-sculpting kata. While this Charm is active, the martial artist is effectively surrounded by a bubble of water for all purposes. This effect explicitly allows her to meet the requirements of all Aquatic-keyword Charms, as well as presenting the possibility of drowning air-breathing opponents by holding them in a clinch (or of drowning herself, if she is incapable of holding her breath or breathing underwater).</description>

        <description>The martial artist twists in the water, casting her Essence out in cascading ripples. Her image is imprinted a hundred times on the water, and to maintain equilibrium, she takes the rippling appearance of water into herself. This Charm may be invoked only within one yard of the surface of a body of water. The next attack aimed at the martial artist suffers an external penalty equal to her Martial Arts rating as reflections obscure her true position. Whether the attack strikes or not, however, the turbulence of the attack disrupts the maze of shimmering reflec-tions, revealing the character's true position. The Charm affords no further protection and cannot be reactivated until her next action.</description>

        <description>The rippling surface of the water provides more than simply defense. By obscuring the martial artist's true position, it allows her to launch full frontal attacks that still strike in unexpected ways. An attack enhanced by this Charm forces the opponent's player to make a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll against a difficulty equal to the martial artist's Essence. If this roll fails, the attack becomes undodgeable. This Charm may enhance only those attacks that strike through the surface of a source of water at a target on the other side (e.g., the surface of the ocean, the face of a waterfall).</description>

        <description>The master's refined understanding of the narrow skin that separates sea and sky finds its ultimate expression in this technique. The martial artist makes an unarmed martial arts attack. Should it inflict any damage, then the target inverts his normal breathing requirements for the remainder of the scene. Targets that normally respire air must breathe water, and vice-versa. The martial artist may target himself with this Charm. A second application of this Charm against a target already suffering its effects returns the victim to normal.</description>

            <description>This martial art was innovated among the high crags of the uttermost North by the graceful Pterok, and it suits both its makers and the landscape of its birth well. It is a graceful art, austere and beautiful like the snow-capped mountain peaks; and like those peaks, its gently gliding masters can unleash terrible violence at a moment's notice. The soft crust of snow might conceal deep crevasses, or sharp frozen stone. The snow itself might leap from the slopes to bury the unwary or unlucky. So it is with practitioners of this style, who take the biting winds of their homeland and give it teeth for true, stripping flesh from the bone with power dives and wing buffets.
   Unlike many of its contemporary Dragon King martial arts styles, Dagger Wind has stayed almost exclusively in the hands of its original innovators. A few Pterok living in Yu-Shan practice it, and it makes frequent appearances at the Heaven-and-Earth Invitational. The bulk of its surviving practitioners, though, are in Vesathar Valley (see Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 19), where it has never fallen out of use.
   This style is aspected toward the element of air.
   Weapons and Armor: Dagger Wind Style is practiced unarmed and in, at most, light armor. Many of its techniques rely upon the wing buffet attack of the Pterok, and so the possession of flight-capable wings is a prerequisite for its practice.
   Complementary Abilities: The rigors of this art demand that its practitioners possess at least Athletics 2 and the ability to fly.</description>

        <description>Tucking his wings against his body, the martial artist plummets into a power dive. As the wind rushes past, chilling his skin, he takes its power into his limbs and focuses on his target. Finally, just before impact, the martial artist pulls up, grasping his target with his feet and transferring all momentum to hurl his opponent through the air. This Charm constitutes a clinch attempt that, if successful, may be used only to release the target with a throw. The distance of this throw is multiplied by the number of consecutive preceding actions the martial artist spent dashing in a full-speed power dive, up to a maximum of (Perception) actions.</description>

        <description>The martial artist enters a power dive, wrapping himself in a swirling corkscrew of ice-cold wind that screams around him as he accelerates. He pulls up on contact with his target, releasing an enormous wing buffet like a hurricane. Well-aimed strikes using this technique have been known to tear unarmored men apart with sheer wind-force. This Charm may be executed only at the end of a power dive, as with Tumbling Avalanche Technique. The martial artist makes a wing buffet attack rather than a clinch attempt, however, and the raw damage of the attack is multiplied by the number of consecutive Dash actions taken beforehand - again, to a limit of (Perception) dashes.</description>

            <name>Shadow Hunter Style</name>
            <description>This dangerous and deadly martial art was developed in tandem by a pair of Raptok masters during the First Deliberative Era of the First Age. Storied companions to the Night Caste hunter and assassin Scarlet Silence, the pair developed Shadow Hunter Style in order to help stalk enemies of the Realm and bring them down without warning. After Scarlet Silence retired to Meru and lost interest in exploring the borders of Creation, the pair returned to Rathess and opened a school, which proved immensely popular among the city's Raptok and human population.
   That was long ago, however. Now there are no remaining large groups of Dragon King practitioners of the style. Scrolls and memory crystals containing instructions in its forms still remain in the city of Rathess, but the few civilized Raptok who dwell there have not yet discovered them. The style has fallen out of use and favor in Yu-Shan, as the city offers few outlets for packs of hunters to stalk prey through its glittering streets and well-maintained parks. (Rumors do circulate among unemployed gods in abandoned sections of Heaven, however, of hungry reptilian predators who have developed a taste for the flesh of the divine).
   In the Second Age, this style's primary practitioners compose a group of quasi-barbarian assassins called the Black Shadow Striders, who hire them-selves out to the highest bidder among the various principalities of the Hundred Kingdoms. They fight primarily with wooden finger-claws that replicate Raptok claw attacks - down to the game traits. They usually steep these faux claws in concentrated mixtures of the same jungle poisons that, in lighter doses, they use to awaken their own Essence.
   This style is aspected toward the element  of wood.
   Weapons and Armor: Shadow Hunter Style is practiced unarmed, though small hand-blades or finger claws replicating the natural weapons of the Raptok are compatible with its Charms. It may be used only in light armor. Leaf armor (see Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 23) was the traditional garb of its original practitioners.
   Complementary Abilities: Depending on the environment in which they intend to practice this style, practitioners must possess at least one dot of Stealth or Survival.</description>

            <description>This dangerous and deadly martial art was developed in tandem by a pair of Raptok masters during the First Deliberative Era of the First Age. Storied companions to the Night Caste hunter and assassin Scarlet Silence, the pair developed Shadow Hunter Style in order to help stalk enemies of the Realm and bring them down without warning. After Scarlet Silence retired to Meru and lost interest in exploring the borders of Creation, the pair returned to Rathess and opened a school, which proved immensely popular among the city's Raptok and human population.
   That was long ago, however. Now there are no remaining large groups of Dragon King practitioners of the style. Scrolls and memory crystals containing instructions in its forms still remain in the city of Rathess, but the few civilized Raptok who dwell there have not yet discovered them. The style has fallen out of use and favor in Yu-Shan, as the city offers few outlets for packs of hunters to stalk prey through its glittering streets and well-maintained parks. (Rumors do circulate among unemployed gods in abandoned sections of Heaven, however, of hungry reptilian predators who have developed a taste for the flesh of the divine).
   In the Second Age, this style's primary practitioners compose a group of quasi-barbarian assassins called the Black Shadow Striders, who hire them-selves out to the highest bidder among the various principalities of the Hundred Kingdoms. They fight primarily with wooden finger-claws that replicate Raptok claw attacks - down to the game traits. They usually steep these faux claws in concentrated mixtures of the same jungle poisons that, in lighter doses, they use to awaken their own Essence.
   This style is aspected toward the element  of wood.
   Weapons and Armor: Shadow Hunter Style is practiced unarmed, though small hand-blades or finger claws replicating the natural weapons of the Raptok are compatible with its Charms. It may be used only in light armor. Leaf armor (see Scroll of Fallen Races: The Dragon Kings, p. 23) was the traditional garb of its original practitioners.
   Complementary Abilities: Depending on the environment in which they intend to practice this style, practitioners must possess at least one dot of Stealth or Survival.</description>

        <description>Nature and history conspire to teach that numbers count for more than individual might; the martial artist heeds this lesson well. This Charm supplements a coordinated attack, permitting the martial artist to reduce the target's DV by an ad-ditional point due to his participation, although this benefit applies only to his attack and not those of his allies.</description>

        <description>Although glory may go to the bravest on the battlefield, victory generally resides with the most opportunistic. This Charm supplements an attack that is unexpected due to the target's being surrounded (see Exalted, p. 155), adding (Essence/2) automatic successes to the attack and converting one die of post-soak damage into an automatic success.</description>

        <description>The martial artist compresses his body sinking down low to scurry about presenting the smallest possible target profile. He moves in quick bursts, propelling himself from cover to cover, carefully selecting the moment most suited for an attack. While this effect is active, the martial artist enjoys an extra point of close and ranged DV bonus when utilizing hard cover (see Exalted, p. 147) and adds his Essence to his Move and Dash calculations.</description>

        <description>The way of the hunter is one of trial and, all too often, failure. Still, if the first strike fails, a dedicated hunter does not abandon the chase. In the chaos of life-and-death struggle, opportunities to strike again are always available for those trained to take advantage of them.
   This Charm permits the martial artist to make a roll to re-establish surprise mid-combat as long as any degree of hard cover at all is available, and adds its close combat DV bonus in automatic successes to the attempt.</description>

            <description>This Terrestrial martial art is one of Autochthonia's oldest and most widespread. Its primary practitioners are a subset of regulators scattered across the Eight Nations known as the Flashing Wire Collective. Once, the Collective enjoyed bonds of close comradeship across international lines, but it has drifted apart in the centuries since its original founding. Now, Collective members within individual nations are fiercely competitive with their foreign brethren, often organizing competitive underground martial arts tournaments when two nations are drawn into close proximity (and using their own investigative authority to keep the rest of the Tripartite from nosing into matters).
   Alchemicals also make frequent use of this style, prizing its capacity for non-lethally disabling heretics and criminals for later questioning. They often mount retractable whips directly into their wrists with Integrated Arsenal System (see p. 129) and employ the style's form benefits alongside their own technological Charms.
   This style is aspected toward the element of lightning. Alchemical Exalted pay no surcharge when using its Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Live Wire Style is fully compatible with armor. It is practiced exclusively with braided steel cables (treat as whips) and their artifact equivalents, which are generally dual-wielded. The style is not compatible with natural unarmed attacks.</description>

        <description>Those who uphold Autochthonian law often find themselves regrettably outnumbered. The first lesson of the Flashing Wires, then, is to fight with the strength of two men. While this Charm is active, the practitioner suffers no off-hand penalties and reduces multiple action penalties by two dice when attacking with dual-wielded whips. If the character is wielding more than two whips (normally requiring specially wire-braided hair, additional arms or a stunt using one's feet), the multiple action penalty reduction is -3 instead.</description>

        <description>Criminals commonly craft crude weapons for themselves or steal them from their betters. Flashing Wires have found that they are quicker to surrender once relieved of such dubious support. Channeling a quick snap of Essence, the martial artist's whip flashes through the air to curl around a criminal's weapon, disarming him in a burst of sparks. When used to supplement a disarm attempt, this Charm converts the standard disarming bonus of the character's whip into automatic successes and doubles the length the weapon is thrown.</description>

They often mount retractable whips directly into their wrists with Integrated Arsenal System (see p. 129) and employ the style's form benefits alongside their own technological Charms.
   This style is aspected toward the element of lightning. Alchemical Exalted pay no surcharge when using its Charms.
   Weapons and Armor: Live Wire Style is fully compatible with armor. It is practiced exclusively with braided steel cables (treat as whips) and their artifact equivalents, which are generally dual-wielded. The style is not compatible with natural unarmed attacks.</description>

        <description>If the merciless coil of one whip is difficult to escape, two surely present a hopeless situation. The martial artist's whips lash out in a sizzling helix pattern, entrapping suspects for later questioning. This Charm supplements an attempt to establish, maintain or seize control of a clinch with a whip, adding one bonus success to the roll per whip used to entangle a target.</description>

        <description>The martial artist executes an ongoing kata as he fights, viciously lashing his whips into jagged zigzag patterns that crackle with discharged electricity. While this Charm is active, the martial artist may reflexively pay one mote in Step One when attacking with a whip to send bright arcs of eye-searing electricity racing down its length. Doing so adds one automatic level of bashing damage to an attack's post-soak damage. If raw damage is reduced to zero, this benefit is wasted.</description>

        <description>Sometimes, offenders refuse to recognize the primacy of law, even once found out and ensnared. The Flashing Wires shrug; those that will not kneel will be knelt. The martial artist concentrates his Essence around his heart, then releases it down his arm and through his whip in one vast, brutal surge. This Charm can boost crushing damage with a clinch using a whip, adding the attacker's Martial Arts rating to his raw damage. Alternatively, the Charm can enhance a whip strike, making the attack's damage piercing.</description>

        <description>Some criminals believe they have nothing to fear from the Flashing Wires because they have armed themselves with stolen crossbows or other ranged weapons. They are mistaken. The martial artist lashes his whip into the air in a broad arc, discharging a powerful electrical blast that sends projectiles flying away. He raises his Parry DV with the whip by two against any single attack or four against ranged attacks using metallic or metal-tipped projectiles.</description>

        <description>Those who would assault representatives of Autochthonia's order will face the wages of their own dissidence. The Flashing Wire insinuates an oscillating tremor into his whips, causing them to hum and visibly sizzle through the air as though transmuted into bolts of lightning rather than merely conducting them. Until the end of the character's next action (i.e., the action following the activation of this Charm), her whips have Speed 3, Rate equal to their wielder's Martial Arts rating and the cost to add electrocution damage to an attack with Live Wire Form is zero motes rather than one mote. As a final benefit, if the martial artist has any empty hands when she activates this Charm, the appropriate number of whips formed of actual lightning appear in her grip for her to wield for the duration of the Charm. These weapons use standard whip traits plus the benefits above.</description>
