        <description>...to a room where each found her most favored foods.
   Home is where the heart is, and many do not keep their hearts in safe enough places. Instead, just as a seductress abuses insecurities of the soul to take a man's heart from his happy home, the martial artist can reshape her victims' loyalties.
   The Exalt must impress a target with the sheer significance of her mien and how it should feel to be recognized by such a person. Her image assaults a single target, whom the character must be able to see in detail, and her player rolls (Appearance + Martial Arts) against that target's Dodge MDV to steal his secret heart. This social attack always aligns with the target's Temperance, reducing his MDV by two if his Temperance is greater than 2.
   If she chooses, the martial artist may first instigate a clinch attack against her target. She does not move, instead ensnaring her target with invisible strands of tangible attention. The strong-willed are more easily snared by this grapple. If the martial artist accumulates fewer successes than her target has dots of Willpower, add one automatic success. Once the martial artist successfully clinches her target, her player makes future opposed grapple rolls (with the same condition for an automatic success) reflexively on her action, allowing her to focus on other things. When she loses control of the grapple, by choice or otherwise, her player makes the (Appearance + Martial Arts) roll to steal her opponent's secret heart. For each action (including the first) that she maintained the grapple, she adds one automatic success to the roll.
   Overcoming the victim's mental defenses makes the target believe he is a part of the character's solipsism. Certain that only the martial artist's awareness makes him real, the Charm's target tries to stay within the character's current awareness in order to remain real. "Being known by (the character)" becomes an additional Motivation for the victim, and he recovers Willpower only in the character's presence. When he is away from the martial artist or somehow sure that the character is not aware of him, the victim seeks to gain the character's attention through any means necessary. The only exception is when he believes the character will return to him, as when he waits in her bedchamber or some other frequented area.
   The victim must spend two points of Willpower to shake this unnatural mental influence for a scene. Once he spends 20 temporary Willpower, he is free of the delusion forever. Any Charm or magical effect that could defeat this illusion effect has its Essence cost multiplied by the target's Temperance.</description>

        <description>Also there was all they ever wanted.
   Thin veils separate desire, belief and knowledge. This technique tears them away. With the slightest touch, the character dooms his foe (or sacrifices his friend) to a world without failure.
   A mere brush with a finger realigns the victim's spiritual centers, or chakras. In combat, a normal (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack must penetrate the target's defense but need not inflict any damage. If the attack succeeds, the world reshapes itself around the target's needs and desires. There is no immediate sensation, but a victim of this Charm knows with utmost certainty (as she takes her next rolled action) that she is fated to succeed. Most people would revel in such a feeling and glory in destiny's aid when completing their action. The target must specifically choose to deny fate, succeeding or failing the action under only her own power, in order to evade the Charm's effects. Otherwise, she forfeits her mental defense.
   Should the target attempt to refuse this aid, the martial artist's player rolls his (Martial Arts + Essence) and adds a number of automatic successes equal to his Performance, comparing the result to the target's Dodge MDV. For some people, this unnatural mental influence may oppose a Virtue.
   When the target accepts fate or succumbs to the character's mental onslaught, her player adds 10 successes to all her rolls for the next minute, making even her attempts at routine tasks epic. This bonus does not count toward the maximum number of successes or dice a character may gain from Charms. After one minute, the target receives one fewer free success, and she loses another for each minute that follows. The target is the only person who cannot become aware of this waning perfection. To her, her every act continues to outperform the gods. It does take time before the target's perception departs from reality. For several minutes, she really does clear the battlefield with sweeping blows, draw up brilliant architectural plans or wow society with her daring repartee. Thereafter, she does only as well as she normally can - maybe worse, since she's so out of touch - but her eyes see continued brilliance, perfect blows against her enemies, infinite strength and wisdom. She succeeds at her every aspiration with luck, grace and effort to spare.
   The target's madness makes excuses for Creation's mistakes. If she tries to run without rest from Gethamane to Chiaroscuro, it is a great blowing storm, rife with mischievous spirits that slows her - not her rubbery legs. When guards force her from a ball where her atrocious dance and voice earned her a black mark, they are beaus escorting her to a private audience with the disguised marquis, and they refuse her entrance later with soft pleas that they cannot stand to weep so oft for beauty. The sheer cliff that she strikes thrice in order to shape it into a perfect palace appears so, but monsters or villains appear to destroy it.
   Even using Charms or other magic to cure the psycho-logical malady cannot always help the victim of this Charm. Returning to a world where you are not effortlessly perfect can break a person in ways no Charm can fix. Occasionally, a Sidereal must inflict this torture on a friend or ally, when he must achieve a very difficult task.</description>

   Being defeated by a true master of the martial arts can be an enlightening experience. Indeed, masters pride themselves on granting a learning experience. Attacks supplemented with this Charm inflict only bashing damage but double their raw damage. A victim who fills his Incapacitated level with bashing damage inflicted by this attack falls immediately unconscious, despite any efforts to remain awake. Extra bashing damage does not convert to lethal.
   While unconscious, the character dreams of his encounter with the martial artist. He sees her approach and begin the conflict, and the final blow overwhelms him many, many times. He wakes up a changed man205 for his Virtues have shifted.
   Note the total of the target's Virtues, then reduce them all to 0. For each Virtue, roll one die and divide the roll result by two (rounding down). That number is the new Virtue rating. Add up the total of the new Virtue ratings.
• If the new total equals the target's old total, you're done.
• If the new total is less than the old total, roll a single die for each Virtue. If the die rolls a success, add one dot to the Virtue. On a failure, add nothing. On a botch, subtract one.
• If the new total is greater than the old total, roll a single die for each Virtue, but subtract one dot from the Virtue on a success and add one for a botch.
   Continue until the target's total Virtues equal his old total. Virtues cannot drop to less than 0. If a Virtue rises above 5, ignore any roll that adds to it still further. The character may nevertheless end up with some Virtues above 5 and some at 0, making him potentially more and less than human - fanatic in some ways or unconcerned in others.
   Alternatively, the character may shape her unconscious victim's Virtues herself. Doing so requires her to maintain continuous physical contact with him from the point when he loses consciousness until her next action. Without special effort, maintaining contact thus applies a -1 external penalty to the character's DVs due to limited mobility. The Charm takes on the Touch keyword. The martial artist may then move a number of dots of the victim's Virtues equal to her own Essence, but she must leave at least one dot in each Virtue and may raise none higher than 5.
   Exalted affected by this Charm may have a new primary Virtue. In that case, change the character's Flaw to suit her new highest Virtue. Limit rating transfers as well. Raising a Virtue from 0 requires powerful magic or a potent quest. Some savants believe the Fair Folk have Virtues to trade.</description>

        <description>companions,
   The ability to discern one person from another should stem from the person's soul, not her face. Appearance is a façade. The martial artist proves this when he activates this shattering attack. First, he moves so quickly he blurs into the background, traversing as much as (Essence x 50) yards in order to reach his target. As the Exalt strikes, he moves so quickly he appears to be in four places at once, though there is only one true attack. What's more, each version of himself looks completely different. The character may determine his brief appearance with complete control, as long as he appears human. The target's player rolls (Perception + [Ability relevant to defense]) against a difficulty equal to the martial artist's Dexterity to identify and react to the true attack. Failure means that the attack becomes unexpected.
   If the blow connects (though it need not inflict damage), it disrupts the target's mind and Essence, though the damage builds slowly. A day after the attack, the target's mind begins to filter every person she perceives through her unbridled memory, replacing each random person's image with someone she previously encountered. These images are drawn from the inaccessible depths of a person's perfect memory. The roster includes everyone from old friends, parents and lovers to someone seen only once (at a distance, in a crowd). The stronger the memory of a person and emotional attachment to (or revulsion from) that person is, the more frequently his image takes another person's place. Smell and voice accompany the image. In cases where the target could never discern the person's personal scent or had never heard his voice, her mind makes something up. In large crowds, the target can see multiple images -sometimes at different ages - of the same person. Any first encounter with an individual is exempt. The first impression is always true, and a new person looks then like he or she does to everyone else. During this encounter, the person's image, voice and scent join myriad others in the victim's memory for eventual recycling.
   Although no one except a completely new individual will ever look like himself again to the target of this Charm, the target has no chance to get used to her shopkeeper looking like her father and her lover looking like a total stranger of the other gender. Every time she sleeps, the images her mind associates with the various people she's seen reset. Going to bed beside a stranger, she might wake up next to her first sifu. Knocked out in a bar fight, she won't know who's friend or foe when she gets up.
   Stress and weakness aggravates the issue. Whenever the Charm's target has seven points of temporary Willpower or less, her mind changes each person's image after each scene instead of each day. Characters with permanent Willpower ratings of seven or less always suffer this level of confusion. With only four points of temporary Willpower remaining to her, the target's perception of people changes every time she looks away or blinks. She also has trouble telling whether someone is standing still or moving, and which way he is moving. Her player may roll (Perception + Integrity) at difficulty 2 in order to keep track of one person by location. At zero Willpower, people change as she watches, and they move or slide through her vision even when sitting still. The (Perception + Integrity) roll becomes difficulty 4. During combat, tracking a person is a DV -1 miscellaneous action. Failing the roll means the victim attacks the wrong person or, if there is only one opponent, she misses completely.
   The target can force some constancy on her life for a short while. By spending one point of Willpower, she can force her mind not to change anyone's aspect for a full day, assuming she doesn't sleep or lose consciousness. For two points, she prevents one person's image from changing during her next period of unconsciousness; that person's appearance also remains constant until then. If she spends three points all at once, she perceives one person's true image until her perceptions next change. No amount of Willpower breaks this effect completely or permanently, but Charms such as Transcendent Hero's Meditation can defeat it. Multiply the Essence cost of Charms that cure this effect by the target's Conviction.</description>

        <description>tales of wonder,
   Infants have great freedom of thought, but no basis for understanding. Adults have a lifetime of education and experience, but they are wrapped in their habits of thought. Tightest of these chains is language. The Primordials designed mortals to communicate and interact, and so mortals do, clipping the wings of their minds.
   When invoking this Charm, the martial artist names a language family (see Exalted, p. 109) and evokes an image of that language's dominant god. God-images always have some features appropriate to the language's home. Forest-tongue dictates leaves, roots or other forms of life; High Realm must evince stone and regality. Anyone who speaks or understands that chosen language and can possibly see the image has her gaze drawn to it. They see the martial artist strike at this avatar of language with fist and Essence, and the image shatters into a thousand pieces.
   The players of all who observe the event roll their characters' (Intelligence + [Integrity or Linguistics] + Essence) against a difficulty of the martial artist's Essence. If the roll fails, they lose one dot of Linguistics and all ability to speak or comprehend that language. People who do not speak that language are not affected. An affected character can never again speak, write, read or understand that language. Remember that most characters speak only their native tongue fluently, and they know other learned languages imperfectly.
   A character robbed of her only (or last, should this Charm be used multiple times) known language can never again learn any language. The victim can never raise her Linguistics above 0. The martial artist has ripped an ephem-eral but permanent binding from her. The victim no longer understands any form of interpersonal communication, and her soul becomes free of the structure of words. No method of social or mental influence that depends on communication can affect her. She adds the higher of her Intelligence or Essence in dice to any action that involves creativity, invention, spatial reasoning, gut-level understanding, exerting one's will instead of one's flesh and other efforts potentially hindered by the constraints of language. Of course, she can never communicate her brilliance to others.</description>

   The end is in the beginning. To use this Charm, a martial artist perfectly mirrors his own previous actions - but in reverse. His opponent realizes that time has now begun to flow backward, and she is doomed to live out into her past until life ends in the womb.
   As long as the victim can see the martial artist, she can suffer the Charm's mental attack. The martial artist's player rolls (Martial Arts + Essence), adding a number of automatic successes equal to his Compassion. The Charm takes hold if the roll exceeds his target's Dodge MDV.
   The target stops moving. For the next six ticks, she no longer perceives reality. Within her mind, she experiences her entire life backward, conscious of events but unable to change anything she did in the past. It happens in an instant, but to her, the experience lasts her entire lifetime. Her player may roll (Integrity + Willpower) against a difficulty of the character's (Martial Arts + Essence). Success breaks her out of the trance. Failure costs her one point of temporary Willpower as she experiences complete helplessness, but it reduces the difficulty of the (Integrity + Willpower) roll by one and allows her to roll again. This cycle continues until the victim breaks free of the entrapment or runs out of temporary Willpower, at which point she believes her existence ends with her first moment of sentience. The target suffers a number of levels of unsoakable bashing damage equal to her attacker's Essence and returns to reality, gasping for life and bereft of will.
   Further, the trance displays the victim's past not only how she perceived it, but also as it truly was. When the two are different, they are thrown into stark relief. Whenever the victim re-experiences a portion of her life in which what she perceived was not real, she recognizes the illusion for what it was. If the illusion still afflicts her, it is cured when the trance ends. Because this aspect of Two Score Mirror Glance costs nothing to invoke once it is active, using it to break illusions from Birth of the Perfect Ego Juggernaut or Kaleidoscopic Disrecognition Atemi does not suffer increased mote cost.
   Because subjects of this Charm experience every moment of their previous life as if it happened at normal speed (although backward), masters sometimes use this Charm to enlighten their pupils. Some Sidereals use it to recover lost memories of their past or as explorative meditation. Since breaking out of the trance sooner means the subject experiences less of her life, a master may forbid his disciples from exercising their wills during this sort of lesson.</description>

   One has never learned enough, but the victim of this Charm will never learn again. When the character attacks (with whatever Martial Arts attack she wants), her slashing knife hand looks bladed and devilishly sharp, and her victim appears to onlookers like a figure of shining threads. The attack inflicts lethal piercing damage. It reduces the effectiveness of mundane armor by five bashing and lethal soak and magical armor by two until it can be repaired. The Charm must inflict damage to take full effect, but each success on the damage roll also reduces the target's MDV by one against the following assault. The martial artist's player immediately rolls (Manipulation + Martial Arts + Essence) against the target's reduced MDV. Success imposes upon the target a permanent case of anterograde amnesia.
   The victim remembers everything in his life until the point when the Charm affected him. Nothing that happens after the decisive attack sticks with him. He remembers the last five to 10 minutes. This is enough for the victim to make sense of a combat scene or a brief verbal exchange, but anything further in the past gets muddled. His memory is fuzzy enough that he does not react violently when he wakes up in a different location than he went to sleep, but he does need to meet people and learn events all over again. As time passes, he becomes more and more dissociated from reality. To the victim, it seems like everything's changed since just last night.
   A target of this Charm may exert his will to keep some additional memories. He may spend one point of Willpower beforehand to retain everything that happens over the next hour or after-the-fact to remember the last scene. The victim may still spend experience to improve traits. Muscle memory and trained reflexes still function, allowing him to increase physical skills. It is harder to learn a language or improve one's Lore, but it's possible with patience and Willpower.
   Eliminating the problem does not allow the victim to regain lost memories - they are gone for good, barring use of Two Score Mirror Glance to experience that period all over again. Yet it does allow him to begin remembering what he experiences. Double the Essence cost of any Charm used to cure this mental condition.</description>

   Identity is a mere trick of Essence. Strands of fate weave through the Essence of Creation. They too are made of Essence, and this determines who and what a person is. The martial artist who uses the Border of Kaleidoscopic Logic Form unravels her own strands of fate and sends them out to snare other people and wrap them in her own pattern.
   While this Charm is active, the character's Essence diffuses through others. She may attempt to mentally assault any sentient entity she touches as a reflexive action. Her player rolls (Manipulation + Martial Arts + Essence) and adds a number of automatic successes equal to her Presence against the target's Dodge MDV. When successful, the character asserts a total control effect upon the target. For the rest of the scene, she controls the character's body as if it were her own. She may move with it, attack with it, laugh or talk with it or simply leave it static. Her actions with this person's body use her own Attributes and Abilities, and the body takes on the character's posture and expression while it is under her influence.
   Controlling another body in no way hinders the martial artist's control of her own body. In effect, she now has two bodies operating under a single mind, each taking separate actions. She may use her Charms or Combos through her victim's body, escaping the normal Charm-per-action limitations. Each body benefits from the Form-Type Charm simultaneously. She may also tap into the Peripheral Essence pool of anyone whose body she commands, using it to fuel any Charms that body uses. Sidereal sutras benefit only those Charms used by the character's true body with her natural Essence pool. The owner of a suborned body may reflexively spend a point of Willpower to take control of the body for a single action. When controlling more than one body, the character's player may reflexively roll (Charisma + War) to coordinate the attacks of some or all her bodies (natural or not). All dice on this roll come up successes. A character may not ensnare more people in this way at one time than she has dots of Essence, but she may release a body reflexively if she suddenly wishes to take over another.</description>

        <description>The Elder Sutra of Understanding: Everything is some-where else.
   Speaking her name twice and a secret name once, the martial artist creates a duplicate of her personality in the form of a glistening shard of anima that she draws from her mouth. It quickly disappears in her hands like a conjuror's trick. The next time she touches a sentient entity, which requires a (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack in combat, she insinuates that replica of her mind into her target. Her identity surges along the flows of Essence to the target's soul, the seat of his self, where it attempts to take command. The martial artist maintains a tie between both identities, perceiving both her normal senses and an internal, purely mental sense of the struggle to dominate her target's body.
   Upon touching her target, the martial artist immediately attempts an unnatural mental attack based on (Manipula-tion + Presence + Essence). She may supplement this attack with Excellencies as usual. Should she overcome the target's highest MDV, the character exerts a total control effect. She is free to command any actions from her victim for the next 10 minutes - usually the rest of the scene, but only 10 long ticks in social combat time. The martial artist is able to use her victim's body, Charms and other abilities with complete efficiency, but with her own Mental Attributes, knowledge-based Abilities, Virtues and Willpower. If the takeover fails, the character may make a number of additional reflexive attempts equal to her Presence on her following actions.When the 10 minutes are up, the magic of the Charm fades. Essence no longer forces the body's owner into the backseat - but the Charm-created identity is self-aware. Its preservation instinct is as strong as that of the original character, and it will not go quietly. Both identities inside the victim's body make a single attack against the other's Dodge MDV. Either may utilize the body's inherent Charms. Whichever gains the most net successes wins control of the body; the losing identity is completely destroyed.
   The martial artist might not wish her duplicate identity to live on, whether out of kindness to her victim or jealousy toward her identity. She may design it to fail at the moment of final conflict. If she does, the replica divides its Dodge MDV in half before applying Charms or stunts.
   Whoever wins, this is when the martial artist's player loses control of the target body. If the body's original mind wins, the martial artist's influence is clearly over. Even if the character's replica wins, it is no longer connected to the martial artist's mind. Though the two identities have identical histories, the different experiences each has from that point on quickly turn them into individuals. They likely share goals and morals - for a while - but the character's secondary personality changes rapidly, especially based on the qualities of the body it now inhabits. Mortal bodies make the mind more cautious and less carefree, while inhabiting an alien body makes the personality alien.</description>

   The Sidereal imagines a place where he does not exist and has never existed. He invents the names of the people who live there. Donning a perfect expression of one of those names in his stance, he becomes a non-entity. For the Charm's duration, the martial artist is not a valid target for any effect or action. Others cannot recognize or remember him. Without Assumption does not replace the character's attacks with non-attacks; other entities may still target and affect these. Without Assumption also does not protect against Charms and natural "attacks" that affect anyone within an area: An avalanche, say, or the Citrine Poxes of Contagion Form, don't really target anyone. They just happen, and anyone unlucky enough to be in the area takes damage.
   Example: An unnamed Sidereal martial artist uses Without Assumption and becomes a non-entity. For the Charm's duration, no one may specifically target her with attacks or Charms. When she attacks a Solar Exalt, he may recognize the assault and activate relevant defensive Charms. He may not use a counterattack, as that targets the Sidereal and not the attack (unless the "counterattack" takes the form of some sort of aura that automatically damages anyone who touches the Solar). Had the Solar a Charm that simultaneously increased DVs and offered a counterattack, he could benefit from the improved defense but not from the counterattack.</description>

        <description>Why stay?
    Humans have great power in them, gifts from their creators sadly contained and constrained by their silly little clay bodies. If they could open that flesh and step out, they could express a smidgen of their potential. Instead, they sit and bake in their prisons of mud, just waiting to be cracked open. This Charm blows breath on that small spark of power all creatures received from their Primordial makers and gives it enough fuel to blossom into a raging wildfire.
   Activating this Charm, a portion of Creation opens around the Exalt, peeling outward from a single axis like an eye with the character as the pupil. It is a two-dimensional rift in a three-dimensional space, and it appears the same from all perspectives. It can be seen clearly up to 10 miles away. Closing, the character disappears with it.
   She undergoes a transformation while nowhere, gaining the following benefits:
• Her Valor manifests itself in her living body, adding (Valor x 2) to the character's Strength and Charisma. Incidentally, this change doubles her stature.
• Temperance manifests itself by adding (Temperance x 2) to the character's Stamina and Wits. She also gains an elemental nature relevant to her location in Creation, as if she were made of wood, the sea, truly living rock or the like. Greater Temperance evokes this nature more strongly in the eyes of those who view her.
• Add the martial artist's (Conviction x 2) to her Intelligence and Manipulation and a like amount to her bashing and lethal soak. She takes on the aspect of the god or force that blessed her with power (usually one of the Maidens), and greater Conviction strengthens that in her appearance.
• Add (Compassion x 2) to the martial artist's Dexterity and Perception. She becomes both death and life at once. Anyone who looks at her sees his birth and demise and feels at once terrified and serene. Greater Compassion makes this facet more readily apparent.
• If her Appearance is 3 or more, it triples. If it is 2 or less, it drops to 0.
    (These improvements do not count toward the limit of dice that may be added through Charms).
• She is considered outside of fate. Certain effects that depend on manipulating the Loom of Fate cannot touch her.
• Moreover, her magnificent god-shape is an expression of the Primordials that created humanity. Bound as they are not to harm their creators, gods and elementals may not attack the character in any way. When she targets a god or elemental with a social attack, consider that attack to be in accord with the target's Motivation.
• The character's form is magnificent and beautiful, but too extreme and true for Creation. Others who look upon her terrible visage lose one point of temporary Willpower. Assume that people avert their gazes unless they attack her or are forced to look at her.
• The martial artist's attacks drain her opponents' Virtues. When she inflicts damage, she also strips a single dot of one Virtue (her choice) from her target. Each point of Virtue that she steals gives her motes of Essence equal to the target's Essence rating. Damaged Virtues "heal" at a rate of one dot per day. When the character takes a dot of Virtue, she also experiences accompanying memories and emotions from her target. She gains a cumulative -1 penalty to her MDVs against that target for the rest of the scene.
• The character's mind is not contained. What things she imagines seem real to others, though they are only weakly phantasmal. When she sweeps with her sword, a rain of steel flies toward her victim. As she parries, pillars of stone erupt from the ground to join in blocking the blow. Sometimes, even armies on the march or nightmare monsters flicker in and out of existence around her. These visions might add bonuses to intimidation rolls or be used in stunts.
   On the martial artist's next action after invoking this Charm, she bursts through the veil of invention into the space she occupied before. Everything within 10 yards suffers five levels of aggravated damage, within 50 yards suffers 10L, and within 200 yards suffers 20B. When the Charm ends, the monstrous entity disappears in an instant, replaced with the character's normal form.</description>

        <description>Go find everything.
   Creation is a mundane place to do battle and one that does not allow for true expression of the warrior's soul. This Charm creates a separate realm. Some claim the character forges it in Elsewhere. Others insist that it exists only in the mind. Regardless, the character appears in a battlefield that is completely of his devising. Scale is usually unimaginably enormous. Range after range of mountains might contain dozens of Imperial Mountains each. The roots of a giant tree might separate several warring cities. The interior of a First Age mechanistic god could stand replete with economically competing nations and heroic god-machines. The battlefield might even lie inside an enormous human body that is failing due to disease. Anything is possible.
   At the moment of this place's construction, the martial artist can include any or all people within his line of sight in his new world, at any level of selectivity. This is no invitation. Anyone the character desires in his pocket realm appears there and perceives it. What nature the sentient "inhabitants" take depends on the nature of the place. They might be the mountain ranges themselves or each a warring society amidst the tree's roots. In the technological world, they might become competing nations or heroes versus decay. In the ailing body, they could be fighting to save it or to kill it from within. No one is bound to stay on this battlefield. Each person subject to the Charm can spend three points of Willpower to escape the constructed place into the real world.
   The martial artist designs how conflicts resolve in this place. He chooses one Virtue as the base of damaging an opponent's position. He likewise designates another Virtue as foundation for a defense. Most likely, the character makes choices based on his strengths. Each Virtue combines with an Ability to make an attack or a defense. These decisions relate to how conflict materializes in the world. Attacking with (Conviction + Craft [Earth]) might describe one mountain range shifting over the course of eons, trying to engulf mountains of another range and claim them. (Conviction + Bureaucracy), in the same scenario, might represent a society of miners depleting another mountain's ores and depriving it of its Essence. (Temperance + Larceny) in the god-machine tricks an opposing nation into devoting its resources to an external expedition, weakening them. (Compassion + Medicine) drives internal parasites out of the ailing body, strengthening it. (Valor + Medicine) might incite the pathogens to deal more damage while an opponent's (Compassion + Socialize) strengthens the body's internal defenses into a powerful community to resist that attack. Any skill except Martial Arts can be used to attack or defend, as appropriate. The player of each person summoned to the battlefield distributes her Martial Arts dots among her Virtues as desired, with no limit. Defense is calculated as (Virtue + chosen Ability + Essence) divided by two, rounded up, for all involved. Specialties, if characters have any that apply, add to their Abilities for the purpose of both offense and defense. The chosen Ability can vary from one defense to the next.
   All players of involved characters begin conflict by rolling (Essence + Martial Arts) as the Join Battle action. Attacks are Speed 4, Rate 3 and reduce one's DV by one each, and combatants may flurry as normal. Guard actions take three ticks. Characters may also aim and coordinate attacks, whose Speeds and DV penalties remain the same. Someone successfully attacked suffers one level of bashing damage and loses one point of temporary Willpower. A character drained of or without Willpower suffers lethal instead of bashing damage, and anyone rendered incapacitated fades from the made-up world. An aggressor may instead choose to attack one of an enemy's Virtues. Success reduces the targeted Virtue by one and allows the attacker to regain either one point of Willpower or four motes of Essence. Damaged Virtues return naturally at the rate of one per day (beginning after Meditative Battlefield Escalation ends). A person who suffers from a reduced Virtue may reclaim one dot (reflexively on her action) by submitting to an unnatural mental influence dictated by her choice among the attackers who harmed the Virtue.
• Reclaiming Compassion renders the target subject to a conditional Emotion effect named by the attacker. Default is abject fear when confronted with the attacker in the real world, but love of a certain country or unbridled rage at a specific creature or class are examples of other valid choices.
• Reclaiming Temperance renders the target subject to one short-term Compulsion effect. Default is to give the character who took the Virtue one item valuable to the target, but any task that takes no longer than one week to perform can be a valid command.
• Reclaiming Conviction renders the target subject to an Illusion effect about the target's self. Default is to believe that the target has no martial skill whatsoever, but any effect that deals centrally with the character's ability, worth or nature is valid.
• Reclaiming Valor renders the target subject to a Servitude effect topical to the created world. There is no default. One might be dedication to the cause of careful mining, fighting to prevent general decay or healing the sick.
   The martial artist has the following advantages in this environment: He can make a number of attacks per action equal to his Essence at full dice pools, at only -1 DV per two attacks (round down). He adds a number of dice equal to his Essence to all attacks. He may inflict lethal or aggravated damage instead of bashing at his pleasure.
   Stunts are as flexible here as in the real world, if not more so, and they function in the same manner. Making an interesting attack garners one die, using the environment in a clever way earns two and wowing the other participants is worth three. They earn rewards of Essence or Willpower as normal.
   Charms can be used here at normal cost. Excellencies add dice to attacks or defenses, but never more than the relevant Ability used. Combining more specialized Charms with this place's abstruse methods of conflict is only sometimes effective. If the effect makes sense in the context of the attack, such as using Wise-Eyed Courtier Method to convince a mining town to relocate to an opponent's range, apply a number of automatic successes to the attack equal to the Charm's minimum Essence requirement. In the rare event that a Charm makes perfect sense being used as normal, its effects may apply in full at the Storyteller's discretion.
   Any person on the battlefield who has mastered this Charm may attempt once during the battle to alter the environment and its conditions. Her player rolls (Intelligence + Lore) as her action against the martial artist's DV based on the same pool plus Essence.
   The character's personal battlefield collapses into nothing when he is defeated or he has no more opponents. At that moment, all participants return (sometimes unconscious) to the real world. No time has passed since the character first invoked Meditative Battlefield Escalation. Though vast numbers may initially be a part of this shared environment, players and the Storyteller should focus on resolving the actions and states of the principal actors. Extras are weak enough that they have little impact on the conflict, and most will spend the Willpower to escape such a strange and frightening world.</description>

   The character scuttles along the unseen strands of fate woven throughout Creation, allowing him to take normal Move actions (or even to stand still) on thin air as easily as on the ground. He can also reflexively spend a mote of Essence to dematerialize between one action and the next, allowing him to become invisible and intangible. While he is under this Charm's influence, the Sidereal climbs on the strands using his hands and feet, with his elbows and knees turned outward like a spider's long legs. The eerie, alien grace of his movements both unsettles and horrifies other people who witness them. The player of a witness who doesn't have this Charm must succeed at a reflexive Valor roll on every action, lest the witness lose her action.</description>

        <description>Arrows fell upon her, forcing her to descend.
   The character moves in a sliding, shifting kata, her feet constantly moving and nearly impossible for the eye to track. Only the third of three separate, successful attempts made by the same character can sweep the martial artist, knock her down, clinch or hold her, or make a targeted attack against her lower body. These attempts may be separate actions, part of a flurry on the same action or a combination of the two. That is, a character might try to sweep the Sidereal's legs in one simple action (and succeed), then duck into a spinning flurry on his next action and make four more attempts to sweep the Sidereal's legs. If at least two of those four attempts succeed, the character sweeps the Sidereal's legs out from under her. Sweep attempts need not be consecutive, but only the successful ones performed in the same combat count toward the necessary total.
   While the character uses this Charm, she can glide almost effortlessly out of the way of a blow. Noticing an incoming physical attack allows her to slip away reflexively, moving up to (Dexterity x 2) yards (even if she has already moved or even dashed in this action). If the attack can still hit her at this range, the Charm increases any associated external range penalties by one success. Attacks that would need to hit her before she moves out of range (such as hand-to-hand attacks) suffer an external penalty equal to half the martial artist's Join Battle dice pool, rounded up. After the first attack, a hand-to-hand attacker would need to move into range again to hit her at all.
   Similarly, the martial artist can scuttle forward up to (Dexterity x 2) yards (even after taking a Move action) to make any of her unarmed Martial Arts attacks. Attempts to parry such an attack suffer a Parry DV penalty equal to half the martial artist's Join Battle dice pool, rounded up, or a value equal to the martial artist's Essence (whichever is higher). Dodging such an attack is a little bit easier, such that Dodge DV penalties equal the lower of those two choices.
   Although the rapid advance or retreat made possible by this Charm is reflexive, a character using it can either advance thus once or retreat thus once per action - not both.</description>

        <description>But the Essence burning within her set the arrows afire.
   The martial artist's fingers needle into the target's flesh, tainting the target's Essence such that her soul slowly dissolves from the inside. The martial artist's player rolls a normal Martial Arts attack, which inflicts its standard damage if it succeeds. The target then begins to hemorrhage Personal Essence, losing five motes every action, exactly as if she had spent them. This effect lasts for one action per damage die the martial artist's player rolled, and multiple applications of this effect stack. When the target runs out of Personal Essence, she collapses into a coma for a number of days equal to the attacker's Martial Arts score. When that many days elapse, the afflicted character awakes with only hazy recollections of what happened to knock her out. Any motes of Peripheral Essence she had when she lost consciousness have now been converted to Personal Essence, with any excess over her maximum Personal Essence simply bleeding away. The victim begins to regain Essence at her normal rate after she wakes up.
   Given three (Speed 5, DV-2) actions of physical contact with a comatose target, a character with this Charm can suck out and devour the target's soul (even if he was not the one to inflict the condition in the first place). Doing so restores the devourer's temporary Essence to its normal maximum, regardless of how much Peripheral Essence the target had remaining. The target dies and fails to move on to the afterlife. If the martial artist consumes a Celestial Exalt, he still refills his temporary Essence but grows sick over the next three days. At that point, he spits out the consumed Celestial Essence, suffering six dice of lethal damage (which ignore armor and soak).</description>

        <description>She answered the arrows' flight with a storm of her own.
   The character extrudes a number of fine threads of Essence equal to her permanent Essence. These threads are under her control, and manipulating them counts as an unarmed Martial Arts attack. Each thread can attempt one of the following maneuvers, at a range equal to (the martial artist's Essence x 10) yards.
• Lift and manipulate a single unattended weapon or object. Attacking with a weapon held by a thread relies on the martial artist's normal traits and counts as an unarmed Martial Arts attack. Parrying with such a weapon relies on the character's standard Parry DV, ignoring any bonus or penalty to Defense from the weapon.
• Pierce an opponent's skin, as a normal unarmed Martial Arts attack that inflicts lethal damage.
• Disarm, sweep or grapple an opponent. Doing so uses the character's full (Dexterity + Martial Arts) pool with none of the standard penalties for disarming.
   The character can also take a physical action in the same tick without the player having to split her dice pool as in a flurry. Further, the character can take an action and still maintain a hold against a single opponent with her full (Strength + Martial Arts) pool without losing or splitting her action. She need only invoke this Charm on every subsequent action. Each thread can hold only a single limb, however, so a held character can still take actions with an unrestricted limb (within reason, or relying on a stunt). If the martial artist devotes multiple threads to holding an opponent, resolve the attack with a single roll.
   Other players attempt reflexive (Perception + [Awareness or Martial Arts]) rolls, difficulty 4, for their characters to pick out the fine threads against the background. Otherwise, except for attacks with a visible weapon, targets do not see the attack and can use only those defenses that work on attacks of which the character is unaware. The threads are tangible and slightly reflective, though, so an opponent may use stunts to make them easier to spot or predict. Blowing pipe smoke in the air to look for how the threads disturb it or spraying ink to speckle the threads might reduce the difficulty by one or two. Retreating into a field of tall grass could reduce the difficulty by two or three. Diving into a pool of water and forcing the martial artist to send the threads down after, especially if the target is a Water-aspected Dragon-Blood, could decrease the difficulty by three or even mitigate it altogether.</description>

        <description>And the small maiden began
   Hundreds of fine, transparent filaments of Essence launch from the character's hands, weaving around the surroundings and each other to entangle all opponents within (Essence x 10) yards. On each action, the Sidereal's player reflexively rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts). Enemies inside the Charm's area of effect, or who enter that area before the character's next action, suffer a cumulative external penalty to their physical-action dice pools and Defense Values equal to half the number of successes the Sidereal's player rolled. These characters receive the same penalty to their natural movement rate in yards (subtracting half the result of the roll from the target's Dexterity in determining movement per tick). This penalty fades by one die, one point of DV and one yard per action that the victim spends outside the radius, as the threads come untangled.
   These threads move with the martial artist, catching new opponents who enter the radius yet eerily bending out of the way of anyone he wishes to give passage. If the martial artist does not keep moving, the threads thicken and become more visible, first as glints of reflected light in the air, then a faint visual impression like cobweb and ultimately (after five minutes of stillness) an opaque morass of webbing around the martial artist. At this point, the web is as impassible as stone for those to whom the character hasn't offered passage. As a stunt, the Sidereal could use the congealed threads to build a bridge, a simple fortification or other structure.</description>

   The character moves her hands with the deft, arachnid precision of a weaver, her fingers flicking like the limbs of a spider. With such grace and coordination, she may take three fully independent physical actions at a time. For instance, she might invoke a Guard action when attacked, then invoke a reflexive Charm while making an ordinary Martial Arts attack, then split her dice pool to use Maw of Dripping Venom against two nearby opponents.
   Fully independent actions follow exactly the same rules as taking successive single actions, except that:
• Only one action actually elapses, which matters for some Charm effects and durations (and also means the sutra discount applies only once). The slowest of the three actions the character takes is the one that determines how many ticks must pass before she can take her next three actions.
• A character who has split her dice pools can interweave her multiple actions. For example, she can split her first action's dice pool to attack twice but take the second of her three independent actions between the first and second attack in the flurry. Split actions penalize a character's dice pools only in the independent set of actions she is splitting. That is, she subtracts a base penalty from every action in one independent set equal to the number of actions she takes in that set alone, not equal to the total number she takes in all sets combined.
• The character may move only once.
• Characters cannot also use extra action Charms or Combos containing those Charms when taking more than one independent action.
   Also, if the character chooses to use this Charm on a given action, she cannot take any non-reflexive social or mental actions. The character does not have to use this ability on every action in a scene after she's invoked the Charm. If she would prefer to use an extra action Charm, use a Combo or take a social or mental action, she can do so (taking only a single action) then resume taking three independent actions per action thereafter.
   Characters using this Charm automatically receive the benefits of the Unnatural Many-Step Stride and Dance of the Hungry Spider Charms in every action.</description>

        <description>The Elder Sutra of Consumption: The maiden became a mother...
   When someone successfully attacks a martial artist who knows this Charm, the martial artist may consume the power of the attack and respond with a devastating counterattack. Swirling his hands in a hypnotic pattern, the character creates a vortex of Essence that draws in and disrupts the physical substance of the attack. Striking this vortex (instead of the martial artist) immediately inflicts the martial artist's (Dexterity + Martial Arts) total in dice of unblockable, undodgeable lethal damage or shatters any normal weapon used against him. If this damage kills an unarmed attacker or destroys an armed attacker's weapon, the martial artist suffers no damage from the attack.
   Using this Charm to defend against a ranged attack or an area affect (such as an explosion) offers no counterattack against the attacker or condition. Instead, it subtracts a number of successes from the attack's damage roll equal to the martial artist's (Dexterity + Martial Arts). Any successes left over on the damage roll thereafter (if any) affect the target normally.
   An attacker can use a perfect block or a perfect dodge to avoid the counterattack's damage, but doing so requires aborting the original attack (as technically it's the act of striking the vortex that inflicts the damage). Either way, the Exalt may make a number of unarmed counterattacks from within the safety of his vortex equal to his Martial Arts score, doubling their raw damage. He can use this Charm in response to a counterattack Charm such as Crimson Palm Counterstrike, but other counterattack Charms do not receive counterattacks against this Charm.</description>

        <description>...and to one child she said, "I have many things to show you".
   A character using this Charm is as destructive to anything in her path as the swarming, hungry thumbnail spiders of the East. These tiny spiders sometimes migrate in the millions, devouring any creature in their way.
   The Sidereal can move up to (her Essence x 10) yards and make three Martial Arts attacks with her full dice pool. Every opponent within a five-yard radius of her as she moves suffers the effects of each attack (applying Dodge or Parry DV to the attacks' totals as normal) as ghostly, evanescent images of the martial artist multiply and swarm all over the path of destruction. If the targets have defensive effects that hurt attackers - such as counterattacks - the attacker ignores these effects (much as a swarm of spiders ignores the loss of a single spider or two). These images disappear as quickly as they appear. The Exalt's attacks affect both material and immaterial targets, and the martial artist can launch these attacks against either type of target while she is dematerialized.
   Characters using Thumbnail Spider March do not receive offensive benefits from activating reflexive movement Charms such as Dance of the Hungry Spider, but they do receive such Charms' defensive benefits.</description>

        <description>And to another, she said, "You may rest within my home, and eat; no need to fly".
       People of the South tell stories of the idol Ma-Un-Enle and the great sand spiders who worship before it. Sometimes, Ma-Un-Enle speaks a name. In response, one of the spiders bows on all its legs and walks away. It hides in the sand, waiting years or centuries, until the person whose name Ma-Un-Enle spoke comes near. The spider then leaps from the sand to strike.
   A character using this Charm can both spring at any visible target - possibly miles away - and launch an unarmed attack as a single action. Against a person, this attack inflicts its damage normally, adding the martial artist's Essence as automatic successes on the damage roll. The target's player must also attempt a reflexive (Stamina + Resistance) roll against a difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence. If that roll fails, the force of the attack reduces the point of impact (normally the victim's head, but sometimes the heart) to a cloud of blood-fog and bone chips. The target has six ticks left, during which time the scattered particles are still bound into a loose cohesion by Essence that doesn't yet realize the character should be dead. Only the timely application of a magical effect that heals one or more health levels reasserts the cohesion of the scattered particles. Being healed thus leaves the character incapacitated, inactive and with one less dot of Stamina.
   Treat attacks with this Charm against inanimate objects as feats of strength used to break them. The character's total for such feats equals an impressive (Essence x 5).</description>

        <description>And to a third, she said, "How beautiful you are".
   Far to the West, hand-sized green spiders scuttle along the underside of the ocean's surface as if it were a web. Their pinprick bite paralyzes fish, even sharks or whales, and the spiders burrow into the flesh of their prey as it sinks into the depths. They rise to the surface again days or years later, when they have eaten every piece of their kill.
   One swift blow supplemented with this Charm can render an enemy similarly helpless so the Sidereal can devour him for his Essence. To do so, the martial artist attempts a normal unarmed attack. If that attack inflicts even one health level of damage, the martial artist also paralyzes her opponent's Essence such that the target cannot spend motes or regain Willpower or Essence. (This attack also physically paralyzes the target). At the same time, the target no longer suffers from nor accumulates penalties from disease, poison, degenerative effects, hunger, thirst, fatigue, exhaustion, wounds, cold or heat. He is perfectly defended against such harm. He does not even need to breathe.
   The victim can overcome this effect for a single action by spending a Willpower point, but his player must also succeed at a reflexive (Stamina + Occult) roll against a difficulty equal to the martial artist's Essence. (A character may use this Willpower point expenditure to channel a Virtue and gain bonus dice on the roll, depending on the circumstances). The victim must make a number of these expenditures and successful (Stamina + Occult) rolls equal to the attacker's Martial Arts score in order to completely free himself of the effects, but he need not do so on consecutive actions. Meanwhile, the martial artist can spend the victim's Essence motes as if they were Peripheral Essence. Doing so can invoke the target's anima banner, but only around the target. The Sidereal's anima banner is unaffected.
   A character can use this Charm on a consenting subject - if the subject suffers from exhaustion, disease or other degenerative effects, for instance - allowing her to draw on that subject's Essence freely.</description>

        <description>And as each heard her words and came to the center of her web...
   Once, changes to the Loom of Fate could change anything in Creation. The pattern spiders, which tend the Loom, no longer permit swift and drastic changes, but that potential remains. With a successful unarmed attack, a character can use this Charm to fundamentally change his target, reweaving the structure of the target's existence. Doing so causes one of the following effects:
• Transforms the target into a beast, robbing him of her mind and shape.
• Transforms the target's flesh into one of the five elements: a breeze, a flame, a stone or statue, a pool of water or even a living tree. The target remains alive and aware, but unless she is an elemental of the relevant type, she can take no actions (though the martial artist could transform the target into an elemental).
• Grants the target a new life and identity as any sort of non-Primordial creature (other than an individual who already exists). The target instantly develops appropriate social relationships, seamlessly integrating into the life of any appropriate entities save creatures of the Wyld, beings outside the pattern of fate and spirits on or above the levels of the Five Maidens. (If the Sidereal uses this Charm to transform a person into a Lunar Exalt out in the Threshold, the local beastmen and barbarians "remember" the character as if she's lived her whole life among them, but Luna will not be fooled. Also, the character would gain no Charms beyond those she already possessed, though any Charms she has and her anima display will visually correspond to those appropriate to her new form). These effects are permanent, and the victim forgets her old life.
• Unmakes the target utterly. In the unlikely (though not unprecedented) event that a targeted Primordial fails to use a perfect defense, that Primordial becomes a Neverborn. Any other target instantly ceases to exist, in life and in the afterlife, as the strands of her Essence come apart and scatter.
   The Shaping effect replaces the normal damage of the attack.
   The reapplication of this Charm or extremely potent powers such as the Endowment spirit Charm can immediately return targets to their original form. Targets transformed into other people and back might have difficulty recovering their old memories, though. Nothing can remake the unmade, however, even transforming a second target into a replica of the unmade one.
   This Charm does not affect tattooed Lunar Exalted, whose bodies reject external transformation. Neither can a martial artist use this Charm to affect a target under the direct protection of a Primordial, Yozi, Neverborn or Incarna (so for instance, nobody's unmaking any Deathlords unless their Neverborn masters are somehow distracted).</description>

   To master this style is to emulate the grandeur of Asna, the first of the pattern spiders. When the character strikes, she seems to divide into many onrushing warriors at once or spin endless invisible filaments of web, as with Rain of Unseen Threads. Either way, fighting such a character is like taking on an army of Asna's own young. Her attacks buffet the victim from all sides, as she surrounds and bewilders her foes.
   When she uses this Charm, the martial artist seems to divide into solid, identical duplicates or simply move fast enough to appear to be in several places at once. So doing, she applies each unarmed Martial Arts attack she makes in one action against all visible opponents twice each, regardless of how far away from her they are when the action begins. Grandmother Spider Mastery is a simple Charm that cannot be used in a Combo. It gives no benefit to characters without access to fully independent actions. (That is, characters not already using Charcoal March of Spiders Form).</description>

            <description>Long ago, the Exalted learned that not only do injuries disrupt the body's Essence, but disrupting a creature's Essence can induce injury. They also found the same is true of disease. Therefore, an attack on a person's Essence could make him sick. This great discovery made possible infectious martial arts that cause and cure disease. (See the Appendix, pp. 153-154, for a complete description of the rules for these martial arts and the diseases they induce).
   The Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style is not the only such infectious martial art, but it is probably the most powerful. The Sidereals invented this style in the First Age, and it remains well known among them today. Relatively few of its Charms require extremely high Essence to master, which makes it a good choice for younger Sidereals.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks with a staff, wrackstaff, seven-section staff, serpent-sting staff, hammer or goremaul as unarmed attacks if the character inflicts bashing damage with them. Such attacks are primarily intended to batter the target's Essence flows into warped, deleterious shapes rather than to inflict crushing damage. Characters cannot use the Charms of this style while wearing armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Before a character can learn the Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style, she must possess at least three dots in Medicine, and greater expertise is desirable for some of the style's Charms.

        <description>...whose lover's practices displeased the sun. The all-seeing sun could no longer sustain
   The martial artist poisons the Essence at the core of her enemy's soul to inflict the White Sun Sickness. This Second Circle spiritual disease combines fever with episodes of painful prickling, like mosquito bites all over the victim's body, and hallucinations when under stress. However, it does not kill.
   A victim of this infectious Martial Arts attack hallucinates and suffers from a fever of the soul. Each time he spends motes of Peripheral or Personal Essence on a Charm, the disease increases the Charm's cost by one mote. This effect is a cumulative one, so the second expenditure costs two extra motes, the third costs three and so on. Reduce the accumulated total by five in each day the victim spends no motes. The fever and hallucinations also reduce all of the victim's dice pools by a value equal to his own permanent Essence. Finally, the victim gains Limit at twice the normal rate for as long as he is infected - a coincidental interaction with the Great Curse, not something the Sidereals ever planned.

            <description>Long ago, the Exalted learned that not only do injuries disrupt the body's Essence, but disrupting a creature's Essence can induce injury. They also found the same is true of disease. Therefore, an attack on a person's Essence could make him sick. This great discovery made possible infectious martial arts that cause and cure disease. (See the Appendix, pp. 153-154, for a complete description of the rules for these martial arts and the diseases they induce).
   The Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style is not the only such infectious martial art, but it is probably the most powerful. The Sidereals invented this style in the First Age, and it remains well known among them today. Relatively few of its Charms require extremely high Essence to master, which makes it a good choice for younger Sidereals.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks with a staff, wrackstaff, seven-section staff, serpent-sting staff, hammer or goremaul as unarmed attacks if the character inflicts bashing damage with them. Such attacks are primarily intended to batter the target's Essence flows into warped, deleterious shapes rather than to inflict crushing damage. Characters cannot use the Charms of this style while wearing armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Before a character can learn the Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style, she must possess at least three dots in Medicine, and greater expertise is desirable for some of the style's Charms.

        <description>these practices, but with enraged disdain, darts forth such pestilent malignant beams...
   Throwing off the enemy's guard with jerky, flitting feints, the character closes in and infects a victim's Essence with the spastic, divisive Drunken Moth Sickness, a Second Circle spiritual disease.
   A victim of this sickness can't entirely control her own behavior. The disease inflicts a general-purpose Compulsion effect specified by the Sidereal - something along the lines of "embarrass yourself", "protect me" or "beat up your family". Treat this influence as an unnatural persuasion; the character can spend one Willpower point per action to resist its effects. On each subsequent action, the infected character may either use a simple Charm, use a Combo or spend at least half her non-reflexive actions serving the disease's purpose. (This last assumes that the character is using a flurry, and the "half" rounds up. If the character takes just one action, it must serve the compulsion).
   Fortunately, the disease forces her to take action only when an obvious way of fulfilling its purpose exists, either without using any Charms or using Charms already active. Otherwise, the character is free to act as she pleases. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of whether an opportunity exists to fulfill the inflicted compulsion.The Drunken Moth Sickness occasionally infects a victim who eats something that contains a bound spirit. Treatment is the same as for the Charm-induced infection.

        <description>as shed infection on air, earth and streams;
   One precise strike disrupts the very cohesion of the victim's body and soul, shattering his Essence into the jagged fragments of the Broken-Tile Organ Condition.
   A victim of this condition lacks the reliable solidity his peers take for granted. When he's struck in combat, parts of his body fall off or spurt out. Roll the victim's Stamina against a difficulty equal to the number of health levels lost in the attack. On a failure, a leg comes off, an eye pops out or some other similar event transpires. When he does lose a limb, though, he need simply stick it back on or have someone else do so for it to seamlessly reattach. Similarly, if he loses an internal organ, he can spend a simple action to swallow it for it to slide back into place. (He can even pop a dislocated eye back into its socket, though it's a good idea to at least wash it off first). Individual organs remain alive, connected and under the victim's control when separated from the body, but the victim still suffers damage normally, due to the sheer physical trauma of, say, heaving up one of his kidneys.
   If the Sidereal successfully infects someone with this disease using an infectious Martial Arts attack, the target automatically loses a limb or organ of the Sidereal's choice. The Sidereal can even attempt to catch the ejected body part with a reflexive (Dexterity + Athletics) action at her full dice pool.
   Defensive Charms protect only such organs or limbs as they naturally apply to. By default, limited leverage reduces the dice pool for a severed limb's actions to 0 before the influence of Charms. Furthermore, most Charms simply do not function when employed by a severed organ. Appropriate stunts or outside assistance can give a victim's limb access to his full dice pool. Sidereal students trade stories about "mix-ups" between victims of this attack, but these are mere fables. No one else's body parts will reattach to another individual's body.

        <description>whence this malady its birth received.
   The character learns the 25 underlying principles of infection and may apply them in combination to inflict the First or Second Circle illness of his choosing on his opponent. Doing so requires a Martial Arts attack supplemented by this Charm.
   Characters can develop their own First or Second Circle infections for use with Essence-Disrupting Infectious Atemi. This requires an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll, the difficulty of which equals the Magical Treatment Difficulty for the sickness. Reduce the difficulty of learning by one if another Sidereal Exalt teaches the character how to inflict the disease.
   Normally, characters practice inflicting new spiritual infections before testing them in battle. Developing diseases extemporaneously imposes a +2 internal difficulty penalty. Doing so also requires Storyteller permission and a separate action from the blow that inflicts the disease.</description>

   With this Charm, the character batters herself or another character into the perfect shape written at the core of the target's Essence. The Sidereal's player rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts) against a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Add the Sidereal's Medicine score in automatic successes. The target can dodge or parry normally, applying his DVs to the attack. If the Sidereal hits, though, her attack inflicts no damage. Instead, she achieves any or all of the following effects:
• The target heals all bashing damage.
• The target heals a number of levels of lethal damage equal to the Sidereal's Martial Arts score. Treat any aggravated damage levels as two lethal damage levels, and heal them first.
• Any Crippling effect imposed on an otherwise whole limb is immediately negated and healed.
• The target's player can immediately spend one experience point to heal one point of permanent trait loss. Doing so cannot raise a trait above the highest level at which it had been previously purchased before the loss occurred.
• Any Shaping effect that has locked the target into an undesired shape (such as Pattern Spider Touch) is undone.
   After a successful application of this method, the target's player must succeed at a Temperance roll (difficulty 2), or the target falls unconscious in a moment of overwhelming ecstasy at the unpain of the martial artist's attack.
   The character can also use this method on herself. The Charm does not affect tattooed Lunar Exalted, who treat it as an external attempt to modify their shape.</description>

The martial artist's player must roll (Intelligence + Medicine) against the Magical Treatment Difficulty to cure a Third Circle illness or against difficulty 5 to cure the Great Contagion with this Charm.
• All poisons and drugs (and Poison effects) leave the target's system, and all physical addictions are broken. (The Sidereal can't do anything about emotional cravings).
• Any Possession Charm affecting the target is broken, and all lingering effects disappear. The Sidereal can transfer as many motes of his Essence to the target as he chooses.
• The Sidereal can transfer as many points of his temporary Willpower to the target as he chooses (though he cannot grant more points than the target's maximum).
• Curses upon the target are broken, although lost Attributes resulting from such curses are not recovered. This includes most Crippling or otherwise debilitating effects imposed by non-physical means.
• The character can erase any of the target's painful memories of which he is aware, though he leaves in contextual clues to those memories. Thereafter, the target may spend a Willpower point to hazily recall these memories for a scene.</description>

   This Charm instantly breaks any debilitating magical effects upon the character, save for those imposed by the limits of his own Charms. For instance, a Sidereal can use this Charm to remove the Crippling effects and DV penalties of the Charm Ox-Stunning Blow (Exalted, p. 243) from a victim who was just knocked senseless by that Charm. Yet, should that cured victim then use the Charm Leaping Dodge Method (Exalted, p. 227), he still suffers the -1 DV penalty for doing so, as that limit is imposed by one of his own Charms.
   Also, until the character's next action, the players of other characters must succeed at a reflexive Essence roll with a difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence for their characters to affect the Sidereal with a Charm, spell or Charm-supplemented attack. The Exalt can invoke this Charm reflexively to impede a magical attack against her.</description>

   The martial artist's Essence blazes up within him, fortifying him against almost any conceivable form of physical damage. For the rest of the scene, he adds his Personal and Peripheral Essence at the time he activates this Charm to both his bashing and lethal soak. After doing so, he must burn through at least 10 motes of Essence each action (losing any he does not spend). Doing so does not reduce his inflated soak. Further, no combination of effects can allow him to regain more than five Essence in a given action.</description>

            <description>Long ago, the Exalted learned that not only do injuries disrupt the body's Essence, but disrupting a creature's Essence can induce injury. They also found the same is true of disease. Therefore, an attack on a person's Essence could make him sick. This great discovery made possible infectious martial arts that cause and cure disease. (See the Appendix, pp. 153-154, for a complete description of the rules for these martial arts and the diseases they induce).
   The Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style is not the only such infectious martial art, but it is probably the most powerful. The Sidereals invented this style in the First Age, and it remains well known among them today. Relatively few of its Charms require extremely high Essence to master, which makes it a good choice for younger Sidereals.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks with a staff, wrackstaff, seven-section staff, serpent-sting staff, hammer or goremaul as unarmed attacks if the character inflicts bashing damage with them. Such attacks are primarily intended to batter the target's Essence flows into warped, deleterious shapes rather than to inflict crushing damage. Characters cannot use the Charms of this style while wearing armor.
   Complementary Abilities: Before a character can learn the Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style, she must possess at least three dots in Medicine, and greater expertise is desirable for some of the style's Charms.

        <description>From him the malady received its name.
   As the character moves in a sinuous pattern of steps and gestures, a susurrant miasma like blood-tinged yellow fog emanates and rises above her, and the air out to a distance equal to (her Essence x 10) yards from the character weeps with contagion. Starting on her next action, everyone within that distance of the Exalt risks infection with the Yellow Poxes of Contagion itself, also called the Revel Outside the Sealing of the Gates. Inflicting this infection is considered an infectious Martial Arts attack. It does not require that the character strike her targets, but perfect blocks and perfect dodges still protect against the outpouring of disease. Players roll their characters' (Stamina + Resistance) against a difficulty of the Sidereal's Essence to resist this Third Circle disease - but they lose all dice from the pool before the application of Charms.
   The flesh of the disease's victim twists and flows, melting while the sufferer remains yet alive. Yellow blisters rise on his skin. This effect inflicts one level of unsoakable aggravated damage per action of the victim, but it stops when aggravated damage fills the -0 and -1 wound tracks. Characters who can somehow protect themselves against Wyld influence can likewise protect themselves from this effect.
       Victims of this disease must also fight the unnatural desire to dance to the rhythmic whispers with which this form fills the air. On any given action, a victim can simply relent to this compulsion and dance around an object or person chosen by the Storyteller at a distance of 10 yards. He can resist this unnatural mental influence for one action by spending a Willpower point, but fighting the unnatural inertia of his own body reduces his effective Dexterity to 0 for that action. The player can still attempt rolls for actions that require Dexterity, but he rolls only the Ability, and not the Attribute. The disease continues after the Form-Type Charm ends, and sufferers continue dancing to a chant only they can hear.
   Characters who use this form are immune to all Sickness and Poison effects, as if employing the Immunity to Everything Technique (see Exalted, p. 208).

   For a single mote of Essence, a character with this Charm renders himself permanently immune to any Poison or Sickness effect to which he has been exposed or subjected. (The character must pay one mote for each such effect individually). He can also spend a mote of Essence to halve the damage from a single attack - after the attacker's player rolls damage - or to reflexively protect himself from any disabling effect upon his body or mind. Spiritual Perfection is (appropriately) a perfect defense against such effects. The Sidereal must invoke the Charm once apiece for every such attack or effect he suffers. The character cannot cure disabilities that arise from factors outside his body, such as being unable to move because he's tied up in the back of a Nexus pulley car.</description>

   With this terrifying Charm, a Sidereal can use an infectious Martial Arts attack to contaminate a victim with arbitrary Third Circle illnesses.
   Characters develop their own Third Circle illnesses for use with Gentle Touch of the Wicked Hand (just as they invent lesser diseases with Essence-Disrupting Infectious Atemi). Infection follows the ordinary rules for infectious Martial Arts attacks, save that it is intrinsically more difficult for a victim to resist a Third Circle infection. Creating such a blight requires an (Intelligence + Medicine) roll, and the Storyteller sets a difficulty between 5 and 10, based on the disease's effects. Reduce this difficulty by one if another Sidereal teaches the character how to inflict a certain disease.
   Normally, characters practice inflicting new spiritual infections before testing them in battle. Developing diseases extemporaneously imposes a +2 internal difficulty penalty. Doing so also requires Storyteller permission and a separate action from the blow that inflicts the disease.</description>

   The character learns to protect himself and others from even the most terrible attacks by manipulating a target's Essence. Under the effects of this Charm, the Sidereal's target (himself or another person) automatically converts any aggravated damage the attack inflicts to lethal damage, before soak. This protection stacks with other Charms that convert lethal to bashing damage, such as the Four Magical Materials Form, though it can't stack with itself. Characters who are under such a combination of effects convert all damage directly to bashing (and all before soak).</description>

   The character pounds her fists against the Essence in the very air, shattering the currents of the world and casting a hail of broken Essence shards toward her foes. On the character's first action, the effects extend three yards beyond her fists. Anything in front of her suffers either 15 dice of aggravated damage or a Third Circle illness she has learned to inflict - whichever the Sidereal chooses. (Targets can resist the disease normally). This attack is unblockable and undodgeable.
   On each subsequent action in which the Exalt continuously performs this Charm (paying the 6m, 1wp cost on each new action), the effects stretch one mile further forward and a tenth of a mile further to each side. The Essence shards this Charm hurls forward do not penetrate solid obstacles (such as walls) until the action on which they either destroy such obstacles or find a route through them (such as a broken-out window or door). It does not extend behind the character or to her sides.</description>

When he divulges his philosophy, he speaks in nonsensical metaphors, and it is difficult for others to make heads or tails of it - even other masters of the style. Perhaps the Sidereal says there are many ways of seeing. Perhaps he says there is only one but it can be portrayed as many. Perhaps he merely says one can choose as one will and punctuates the statement with a perfect strike.
   Weapons and Armor: For purposes of this style, paired sais, paired baneclaws or multiple knives or punch daggers are treated as unarmed attacks. These weapons can be wielded in close combat or thrown with equal facility, using the Sidereal's Martial Arts as the relevant Ability, with one caveat: He must always use more than one. Should the martial artist ever be reduced to a single weapon, he cannot use it with the Charms of this style until he gets another that matches it. Exalted who know this style keep their weapons brightly polished, for reasons that will become obvious.

         With a shout, a step and a ringing clap, the martial artist calls forth a rain of sharpened glass. Her player rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts) to target the attack. For an area (Essence x 5) yards in radius, obsidian fragments slice down, causing a base 15L piercing damage to everyone caught there. This area need not be centered on the Sidereal, (in fact it had better not be because the Charm grants no immunity to its own effects), but it cannot be farther away than (Essence x 25) yards.
   The falling shards cannot be parried except by Charms that grant a perfect parry defense. The Sidereal's attack can be dodged, however, and a Charm that can remove the evading character from the Charm's area as he dodges - Leaping Dodge Method, for example - adds three to the character's Dodge DV since he spends less time in the deadly rain. Undodged successes from the attack roll add to the attack's damage as normal.</description>

        <description>She thought to repair it, but was arrested by the sight of the scattered shards,
   When a foe attacks, the Sidereal brings his hands together, then parts them as if he were opening a pair of curtains. On a successful attack by a foe, this Charm posits an alternative, which then becomes true. The Sidereal may say that his attacker, instead, stumbled and fell at his feet or broke her weapon with her clumsiness. The martial artist must limit himself to a substitute that is possible, but almost anything can happen: For scope, consider the enemy to have botched her attack roll.
   The target of this Charm may reflexively spend a Willpower point to feel unease as the new reality falls into place around her. Her player rolls (Wits + Awareness) with an internal penalty equal to the martial artist's (Essence + Martial Arts). With one success, the attacker didn't botch, but she still didn't hit. With three successes, she tears through the shifting fates and completes the attack at which she originally succeeded. If a mentally unstable or insane person is affected by Ripple in the Silvered Glass and spends the Willpower point, the internal penalty is equal to only the Sidereal's Martial Arts.
   This Charm is a perfect defense that can apply against non-sentient things. In such cases, it works automatically. Furthermore, any action launched through a reflective surface at the martial artist - for example, someone scrying him in a forest pool - can be deflected with this Charm as well. The Sidereal automatically senses the attempt and can choose whether to use Ripple in the Silvered Glass against it.</description>

        <description>which showed so many visions of her face.
   Gesturing at an opponent, the Sidereal calls that opponent's reflection to face her. Any reflective surfaces around the target, no matter how they are angled, show that person. For the rest of the scene, the martial artist can attack the reflection of her foe with even more facility than she could attack the foe himself. Attacks against the reflections are undodgeable, and the target takes a -2 external penalty to parry them. And, as the mirror breaks or the water ripples beneath the martial artist's hand, her enemy feels cracks lancing across his skin. The damage is lethal, and the target's soak is halved against that strike.</description>

        <description>She put the pieces back together at all the wrong angles,
    Catching his target's eye, the martial artist strikes her reflection - and the target's mind shatters into madness. She may be afflicted with multiple personalities, bedeviled by persistent hallucinations or made to suffer from any other terrible psychosis of which the Sidereal can think. The Sidereal's player rolls a normal Martial Arts attack, but instead of her target's DV, the roll must overcome his Dodge or Parry MDV, whichever is higher. Induced psychoses are considered both Compulsion and Sickness effects. Appropriate rituals or Charms may be effective against them, at the Storyteller's discretion.
   With an appropriate delusion, the Sidereal may use this Charm to remove unnatural mental influences on the target, though only by replacing one with another. Treat the Charm's influence as total control, for purposes of opposing other total control effects.
   Example: Ei Zou finds his wife beguiled by a Fair Folk noble, and she is in love. Feeling sad but compassionate, he kisses her forehead, activates Shattering the Balance and causes her to become severely paranoid. Terrified of everyone she used to trust, Ei Zou's wife turns away from the Fair One as her love degrades into suspicion and fear.
   The Sidereal may use this Charm on himself and reflexively does so if he comes under an unnatural mental influence severe enough to usurp his will.</description>

        <description>and was delighted at the image of herself.
   Enemies cannot easily find the person behind the Obsidian Shards of Infinity practitioner's endless reflections. Any time a foe successfully strikes him, the martial artist can spend one mote and break into five shards, which disappear as he instantly and reflexively reforms within a number of yards equal to his Essence. He has taken no damage, and his player may roll to surprise his enemy. (See Exalted, p. 155, regarding unexpected attacks). If someone stands ready to attack the reappearing Sidereal before the next tick, that attack cannot be evaded through this Charm.
       Moreover, if the character loses one of his daggers or sais - through a successful disarm, for example, or if it's thrown without retrieval - the Sidereal can retrieve it as long as he holds its mate. The Sidereal spends one mote and the distant weapon is revealed as a duplicate made of black glass, which shatters, and the original remains in the Sidereal's hand.
   The Obsidian Shards of Infinity Form has a downside, though. For every action the Sidereal takes while using the form, the Storyteller secretly rolls one die. On a selected number (1 is appropriate), she lies about an opponent's actions or the results of the Sidereal's action. The lie must be something that actually could happen. (At that moment, the Sidereal unfortunately saw what might be, instead of what actually is). The truth reveals itself on the character's next action.</description>

        <description>The Elder Sutra of Reflection: The maiden wanted to show everyone how wonderful she looked,
       Reflections don't just portray the world, they give back a new vision. After activating this Charm, the martial artist may deflect any attacks against her - including social attacks and mass combat attacks - as if she were bouncing a beam of light from a mirror. She can choose the attacker's new target as long as that target is not the attacker himself. To everyone who witnesses the event, it looks like that person was the target all along. Only the Sidereal and the attacker know his original intent.
   Foes can slip through cracks in the Sidereal's mirror by using attacks that no observers see coming. The attack must truly be unseen by all watchers, not just the martial artist herself.</description>

        <description>but it seemed as though none could see it.
   Who can resist looking in a mirror? The Sidereal shows his enemy her reflected image - and while the enemy looks, he throws her in. With a touch or a successful Martial Arts attack by the Sidereal, the target of this Charm vanishes. It seems to her that she walks through the world, tries to speak to others or pick things up, but nothing she does affects her surroundings. The only way to see her is to see her reflection. She appears in polished silver just as she would if she were actually in Creation, and any who see her there can hear her as well, but not directly affect her in any way. The martial artist himself can sense her normally, but he can't affect her either.
   The Essence spent on this Charm is committed as long as the target remains trapped. If the Sidereal touches her insubstantial form and voluntarily releases that Essence, or if he dies, then she is freed.</description>

        <description>So she painted a self-portrait,
   The martial artist pulls gently at the mirror she holds before her enemy, and the reflection of her foe suddenly stands beside him. A close observer, however, sees something different about the double - an edge to its smile, the slightest change in its movements. It's not the same person, they think - or, as the duplicates turn toward each other, is it?
   To use this Charm, the Sidereal must touch either the target or any surface reflecting his image. The duplicate -the shard -has the traits, personal possessions and knowledge of the original, save that it does not itself have a reflection. There is also one other, small change, which the martial artist cannot predict or control. This difference is rarely more significant than a change in a single trait's score.
   Although the shard-person has its own consciousness and will, it is completely under the Sidereal's control. At will, the martial artist may see through its eyes or control its movements. If she should take any actions against it, she automatically succeeds. The duplicate lasts indefinitely. At the end of each week it exists, the Sidereal can maintain her control by spending one Willpower point per week that the shard has already existed. As soon as she fails to pay this cost, she loses control of the duplicate and never regains it.
   The shard and original share a mystical bond. The reflection may use any of its parent's Charms, drawing from its parent's Essence pool to do so. (Duplicates of artifacts cannot draw on the power of the originals). The Sidereal also selects one other aspect of the shard's connection to its original:
• A duplicate can share all physical pain with its original. Wounding one wounds the other, torturing one tortures the other, and so on. Killing one, however, does not kill the other.
• The shard and its original share emotions. If one weeps, the other weeps; if one falls in love, the other falls in love.
• A shard can learn everything its parent learns, and vice versa. Should experience points become relevant, both draw from the same pool, and the duplicate is not awarded its own. Training times remain the same, even if shard and original train at once.
• A shard mimics the actions of its original. If one runs, the other runs; if one is picked up and carried, the other is dragged along, even if they are a thousand miles apart.
• The shard dies with its original. Killing the shard, however, does nothing more than knock the original unconscious.
   This Charm cannot duplicate artifacts rated higher than five dots, beings with an Essence score higher than the Sidereal's or possessions that were not on the target's person at the moment of duplication (so no duplicate manses). If the creating Sidereal dies, the shard still exists, freed of her influence. If the parent object of a reflection is destroyed or killed, then the double gains sole access to all the power of the original - but the differences between itself and the original remain, and the Sidereal loses all control over her newly empowered creation.
   The martial artist may use Draw Forth One Shard on herself - but will rarely like what she calls. Sidereals have faced versions of themselves as they might have been, as they wanted to be or as they feared they might become - and few enjoyed the experience.</description>

   Gesturing to one side, then the other, the Sidereal's form multiplies as if reflected between mirrors. The doubles do not move in unison, but similarly. They all dedicate themselves to whatever the original is doing, be it crafting a daiklave, climbing a cliff or fighting an army.
   Every reflection gains the benefits of the Obsidian Shards of Infinity Form. The martial artist may use his other Charms of this style through any of them, but he must pay a one-mote surcharge if he wishes to extend the effects to another duplicate. (For example, he may use Black Shards Fall Like Ice through one duplicate for 10 motes, then pay one mote for each additional double who uses it at the same time). The duplicates cannot use Draw Forth Every Shard - only the Sidereal himself.
   If more than one duplicate attacks the same person, they perform a coordinated attack (see Exalted, p. 144). The target suffers the maximum possible penalty for the number of attackers. The doubles always act on the same tick as the Sidereal.
   Only the first use of this Charm in a scene costs Willpower. The martial artist may create a maximum number of duplicates at a time equal to (his Martial Arts x Essence), and they can venture only as far away as they can be perceived, either by their creator or by each other. None but the Sidereal himself has a reflection.</description>

        <description>and they all believed her.
   With a breath that lays a dark mist before him, the Sidereal steps back, then brings his palm forward in a strike that seems to craze the very air. This Charm may be used only during a climactic scene, when fate hangs heavy and the balance is easily tipped.
   Time stops. The martial artist sees five reflections of the scene before him, each representing a possible conclusion to the scene. He must choose one by stepping into it:
• In one shard, he has won an immediate conflict, with difficulty. Ei Zou fought Ligier, the Green Sun, in its human form until the blood of each spattered the demon lord's palace of brass - and in the end, the demon bowed his shining head in defeat.
• In one shard, he is offered great joy, but no other gain. Searching the brass palace of the Green Sun for his foe, Ei Zou found his wife - lost a thousand years before - confined within a vault. Unable to believe his fortune, he took her tenderly in his arms - and Ligier, in those long moments, escaped.
• In one shard, he has suffered a minor loss but gained a greater, longterm victory. Ei Zou knew he could not fight Ligier and his horde of demon minions - but the bargain he struck with the Green Sun gave him part of what he needed to extort a great secret from the Yozi Cecelyne.
• In one shard, he learns something that completely changes his opinion on an important matter. A chance comment by the Green Sun led Ei Zou to realize just how deep Kejak's treachery went. He knew he could no longer support the Bronze Faction campaign to eliminate the Solar Exalted. Abandoning his plan to fight the demon, Ei Zou strode from the brass palace and went straight to the Gold Faction. In one shard, he loses something dear to him, but one of his greatest enemies is killed or neutralized. Ei Zou saw himself weeping before the open gates of the Demon Prince Malfeas. He had utterly broken his former nemesis, and crippled every one of its lower souls - but had been forced to sacrifice his own daughter to do it.
   Though he will remember using Breathing on the Black Mirror, the Sidereal will not be able to recall the contents of any of the other shards once he has stepped into one. No one else will know that he influenced fate at all.</description>

            <description>Elder Sidereals often recommend that their younger colleagues learn the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation as their first Sidereal martial art. This fighting style requires relatively low proficiency with Martial Arts and Essence manipulation - for a Sidereal style, anyway - and provides an excellent blend of attack and defense. What's more, it provides a comprehensive understanding of Creation's most important substances, entities and modes of wielding Essence.
   The most unusual aspect of the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation is its multiple Form-Type Charms. A diverse array of initial Charms converges on four lesser forms. Once a practitioner masters these lesser forms, she can learn a greater form. Each lesser form offers significant benefits to a martial artist, while the greater form enhances the power of every other martial art the character knows.
   Weapons and Armor: Characters cannot use the Charms of this style while wearing armor. Weapons cannot be used with most Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Charms (or are simply irrelevant), with a few significant exceptions noted for particular Charms.

The compassion and conviction of green jade allows his attacks to inflict bashing or lethal damage. The grace of black jade allows him to supplement attack rolls with one extra automatic success for every three dice her player rolls (rounded up). The reliability of white jade supplements damage rolls with one extra automatic success for every three dice rolled (rounded up). The swift, unexpected force of blue jade knocks opponents back one yard for each level of damage inflicted. The fierce hunger of red jade adds three dice to the character's Join Battle roll or reduces the Speed of her attack by one tick (to a minimum of 1). The character can apply only one benefit per attack.</description>

   The character draws on the flows of Creation's interwoven fates - the raw power, progressive change and elemental stability that play out all around her. In so doing, she becomes like unto a living artifact.
   When using this Charm, the character continuously receives the benefits of its four prerequisite Charms. In addition, she becomes unbreakable like a magical artifact. That is, she automatically converts any lethal damage she receives to bashing damage (before soak), unless the attack could damage one of the five magical materials.
   The youngest Sidereals wonder (though not where their elders can hear) if a fifth contributing Charm might exist, which allows a Sidereal to mimic the properties of soulsteel. If such a Charm has been (or were to be) developed, this form would theoretically allow the Sidereal to incorporate those benefits as well.</description>

   This Charm enables a Sidereal martial artist to catch, tangle and throw the Essence of other Charms as easily as she would trip an opponent and slam him to the ground. When someone uses a Charm against the Sidereal, or when someone within three yards uses a Charm at all, the martial artist's player rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts) against a difficulty equal to the Charm-user's Essence. The Sidereal must activate this Charm before her opponent's player rolls his Charm's effect, if applicable.
   Should Charm Redirection Technique succeed, the Sidereal learns a brief summary of the targeted Charm's effects. She can then choose a new target for the Charm or annul it entirely. The rules for annulling Charms are as follows:
• The targeted character must need to activate the Charm consciously. (Therefore, Charms that invoke themselves - such as Surprise Anticipation Method - are immune).
• The target pays Essence for the Charm, but nothing happens. For simple or extra action Charms, the target cannot act until his next action. For supplemental Charms, he can still take the physical action, just without any Charm assistance.
• A target can immediately reuse an annulled reflexive Charm on the same action as long as he can still pay the activation cost.
• The annulled use of a Charm still counts as the target character's Charm use for that action. An Exalt cannot suffer an annulled reflexive Charm and then decide to attempt a different reflexive Charm on the same action.
   The key rules for redirecting Charms are as follows:
• A Charm can be redirected only if the user could apply the Charm to a new target. For example, the Sidereal can redirect a Solar's use of Iron Raptor Technique against any target within (the Solar's Essence x 8) yards of the Solar. The redirection must also make sense. A Solar's impassioned words can accidentally seduce the wrong target, but Eye-Deceiving Camouflage cannot accidentally hide the wrong person.
• Redirecting the Charm does not change the variable effects. Base these effects on the original user's traits and mote expenditure.
• The victim whose Charm the Sidereal redirected pays for the Charm normally. For simple Charms, the use of the redirected Charm also represents his action.
• Redirecting a supplemental Charm also redirects the associated action, which uses the original user's dice pools.
• Reflexive Charms cannot be redirected.
• Redirecting extra action Charms redirects all possible associated actions to the new target (and to only one new target). If the extra action Charm does not allow the application of every roll to a single target, the character chooses as many actions as possible to redirect, and any remaining actions proceed normally. For example, if a Righteous Devil uses Dance of the Howling Magma Sprites to attack a Sidereal, the Sidereal could redirect the magma sprite to keep attacking the Righteous Devil's sidekick for a number of times equal to the Righteous Devil's Essence, so long as the Righteous Devil's player keeps rolling successful attacks. Yet, if the Sidereal tries to defend a group of people against an enemy Solar's Arrow Storm Technique, the Sidereal can redirect only the first arrow the Solar fires. The rest of the arrows under the Charm's influence still strike their subsequent intended targets.
   Charm Redirection Technique cannot target Charms that were established in previous actions, nor can it target Combos. It does not work against sorcery or Martial Arts Form-Type Charms - they cannot be redirected or annulled. While this Charm is supplemental, the only type of action it can supplement is a guard action. It can annul or redirect only one Charm per action.</description>

        <description>This Charm extends the Charm Redirection Technique, such that the Sidereal can now:
• Annul the effects of preestablished Charms.
• Annul or redirect a Combo. If the Exalt can legally redirect all of the simple, supplemental and extra action Charms that make up the Combo, he can legally redirect the entire Combo as a single invocation of this Charm. Likewise, if he can legally annul all of the component Charms, she can annul the Combo. He chooses whether to annul or ignore the reflexive Charms in a Combo individually, as they are used.
   To use this Charm, the character must be a target of the Charm or Charm-supplemented action, or he must come within three yards of the Charm's original user. The Sidereal's player then rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts) against a difficulty equal to the Charm-user's Essence. When disrupting Combos, the Sidereal must invoke this Charm before the opponent's player rolls the Charms' effects.
       Like the preceding Charm, this one can't affect Form-Type Charms or sorcery. Similarly, while this Charm is supplemental, the only type of action it can supplement is a Guard action. It can annul or redirect only one Combo or annul only one preestablished Charm per action.</description>

        <description>The character launches a precise strike of Essence to knock apart the careful construction of a sorcery effect. Upon contact with such a construction, the martial artist activates this Charm and her player attempts a reflexive, unarmed (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack. The difficulty equals the sorcerer's Essence plus the spell's circle. If the Sidereal succeeds, the spell shatters as if dispelled by an equal circle of countermagic (with the concomitant effects).
   The Exalt can deal even more damage if someone actually casts a spell within her reach and her player succeeds on an unarmed Martial Arts attack roll. She can choose to shatter the spell as normal or cause the entire structure to unravel as if the sorcerer had botched a distraction roll. (See Exalted, p. 251 for more information).
   This Charm functions against necromancy as well as sorcery, but only if the Sidereal Exalted has had opportunity to study this black art of the Abyssal Exalted.</description>

        <description>The Sidereal martial artist combines her knowledge of destiny with her martial skill to disrupt the effects of Sidereal astrology by lightly striking the target in the five points where threads attach from the Loom of Fate. Doing so requires a reflexive, unarmed Martial Arts attack; the difficulty equals the (Essence + College) of the Sidereal who created the effect. A successful attack tears or snarls the magical weave of fate, ending the effect. Both the martial artist attacking the effect and the Sidereal who created it suffer one dot of Paradox, the special penalty Sidereals can face for astrological magic, and the event might trigger an inquiry by the Bureau of Destiny in Yu-Shan.
   This Charm can also target the false identities called "resplendent destinies" that Sidereals use, even currently inactive ones lurking in the target's background. If the target has multiple effects active at once, the martial artist will have to attack them separately. Roll first for any active resplendent destiny, then any other effects, highest (Essence + College) first.
       Resplendent destinies should not be confused with the Destiny Background described in the Appendix. Astrology Interruption Method does not affect true Destiny, and the Bureau of Destiny will certainly investigate such attempts.</description>

   While using this Charm, the character increases her effective permanent Essence score to 10. This increase doesn't provide additional motes of temporary Essence, though it does increase her maximum temporary Essence. It doesn't allow her to purchase Charms, familiars or acquaintances she could not possess at her normal Essence, but for other purposes, treat her Essence as 10 for all effects.
   In addition, the character can make one free use of Charm Redirection Technique, Sequential Charm Disruption, Astrology Interruption Method or Spell-Shattering Palm on every action. This allowance is part of the Charm's effect and does not count as the character's action or as the Charm for his action.

   The character steps into an object or person, displac-ing its natural spirit. The Sidereal's player rolls (Charisma + Martial Arts) against a difficulty equal to his target's Essence. The target's player can make a simple Willpower roll, difficulty 2, each action - each action of the usurper's, that is - to regain control of her body. In the meantime, the Exalt's body dematerializes as it interweaves itself with the Essence of his target's form. He can move and take Martial Arts actions through the stolen identity, using the body's Strength, Dexterity or Stamina if they exceed his own. This Charm even imbues a stolen body with supernatural flexibility and mobility, such that a possessed table could run around or a possessed pine tree could throw its cones at passersby.
   The character using this Charm cannot possess items made of soulsteel. He can possess objects of other magical materials only if he knows this style's Charm for emulating that magical material.</description>

        <description>The character strikes his crown brow throat spine and abdomen chakras in that order, forcibly reshaping his Essence and altering how his anima interacts with the world. This "Charm" is actually a set of Charms, each of which allows the character to mimic the anima banner and anima effects of one other type and caste of Exalted for five full actions. For instance, a Sidereal could choose No Moon Lunar Ways, Zenith Solar Ways, Air-aspected Terrestrial Ways, or the ways of any other sort of Exalt, even other Sidereal castes. Each must be bought separately. The Sidereal must choose which Exalt Ways Charm he activates, and he cannot change his decision until the duration expires. This Charm temporarily replaces the Exalt's anima banner, but it doesn't change his caste mark or hinder his ability to make his Maiden's Lesser Sign.
   The character adds his Essence in automatic successes to one of the relevant caste's favored Attributes or Abilities while this Charm operates. He can choose a new Attribute or Ability each time he invokes this Charm. Knowing Exalt Ways - even Eclipse Solar Ways or Moonshadow Abyssal Ways - does not allow a Sidereal to purchase otherwise forbidden Charms.</description>

            <description>Elder Sidereals often recommend that their younger colleagues learn the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation as their first Sidereal martial art. This fighting style requires relatively low proficiency with Martial Arts and Essence manipulation - for a Sidereal style, anyway - and provides an excellent blend of attack and defense. What's more, it provides a comprehensive understanding of Creation's most important substances, entities and modes of wielding Essence.
   The most unusual aspect of the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation is its multiple Form-Type Charms. A diverse array of initial Charms converges on four lesser forms. Once a practitioner masters these lesser forms, she can learn a greater form. Each lesser form offers significant benefits to a martial artist, while the greater form enhances the power of every other martial art the character knows.
   Weapons and Armor: Characters cannot use the Charms of this style while wearing armor. Weapons cannot be used with most Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Charms (or are simply irrelevant), with a few significant exceptions noted for particular Charms.

   No imperfect creature can truly emulate the complicated, perfect beauty of the spirit courts that manage all Creation, but this Form-Type Charm comes close. While the character uses this Charm, enemies who want to harm her must have their players fail a Compassion roll. Subduing her or manipulating the martial artist is still allowed, though. People who witness the Games of Divinity Form become addicted, such that they crave to see it again for as long as they remember the Sidereal. Their players must succeed at Temperance rolls for their characters to refuse any reasonable opportunity to behold the Charm in use once again. Only a dreamstone addiction wipes away and prevents addiction, though witnessing the Charm does not curb or cure one's dreamstone addiction.</description>

   By manipulating the surrounding flows of Essence, the character makes himself a convergence point for Essence, which he channels into his blows. The Sidereal's player rolls (Dexterity + Martial Arts), unmodified by any other Charms. For the rest of the scene, each of the Exalt's successful unarmed attacks inflicts an additional number of aggravated damage levels equal to the number of successes that (Dexterity + Martial Arts) roll garnered. This damage is soaked separately (if the victim has some means of soaking aggravated damage).</description>

   The character adopts a stately stance that allows her to properly channel and constrain the raw power that the prerequisite Charm feeds into her. This Essence coalesces around her caste mark into a hearthstone, which exists only while the character uses the form. The character receives that hearthstone's benefits, as if it were properly set in a starmetal circlet (or the Exalt's favored magical material, in the unlikely event that a Solar or Abyssal learns this Charm). The player and the Storyteller should work together to determine what those benefits are, developing a four- or five-dot hearthstone that reflects the character's personality. Treat major changes to the character's nature (or Motivation) as architectural alterations to a manse, adjusting the hearthstone's abilities appropriately.</description>

        <description>The Elder Sutra of Essence: The last maiden's name was TAO. These were their names, but they knew them not.
   As she performs the steps and katas of this Charm, the character refracts infinitely into ambient flows of Essence, leaving her everywhere and nowhere, one with all of Creation. When she manifests again (on her next action), she is consum-mately aware of everything around her, reacting to intentions before they are formed, to actions before they are taken and to the battle as a whole as easily as to a single blow.
   This Charm doubles the character's Join Battle dice pool. When she and other characters act on the same tick, the Sidereal always acts first: This is a perfect effect, trumping other Charms that enable a character to act first, unless they also come from a Sidereal martial art. The Exalt is aware of every attack against her and is immune to sensory penalties (which is a perfect effect). She can sense every supernatural effect, object and creature within (her Essence x 10) yards. Noticing something hidden requires a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll, adding the Sidereal's Essence in automatic successes.
   What's more, a character using this form can also invoke any or all of its subsidiary forms, paying the normal Essence cost to do so. As long as this Charm is active, its subsidiary forms can coexist with it and with one another. The char-acter can also invoke other Form-Type Charms, but doing so limits her to two other forms. Other forms are but refracted frequencies of the unified brilliance of the transcendent Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form.
   While the martial artist uses the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form, the character can also use the favored weapons of any other martial arts style whose Form-Type Charm she has concurrently active. Attacks with these weapons are treated as an unarmed attack for the purpose of all Martial Arts Charms. This allowance is a specific benefit of the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form, not a general rule. This effect does not extend to armor.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal establishment would love to know where the Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style came from. No Sidereal, it seems, remembers inventing it, in this life or another. The few Sidereal Exalted who learn it keep quiet, for their fellows regard the style with unease. Who keeps teaching this style? they ask each other. How is it that such a powerful and terrible thing is outside our control? Which would come as a surprise to the few Solar and Abyssal Exalted who don't realize they are learning Sidereal martial arts.
   The Sidereals know this much: Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style begins in dreams, and nowhere else. Sometimes, a student dreams of battles like exquisite dances. He fights beautiful opponents who slip away from him, laughing, then strike with the grace of a falling star. If the Exalt ignores these dreams, the dreams soon stop and never return. If the Exalt chooses to try to learn from these dream-battles, however, he can copy the techniques of his foes and find a sifu in his dreams to explain them. He wakes with his sifu forgotten - but after several nights of dreams, he knows these combat techniques and Charms in his waking life. The character must still pay each Charm's experience cost... but his training takes place when he sleeps.
   Unlike other Sidereal martial arts, characters with relatively low Martial Arts and Essence can learn the early Charms for Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style. At first, it seems like merely a rather odd Celestial martial art. As the character grows in power, so do the Charms, gradually revealing their Sidereal nature.
   As the Exalt continues his training, the quality of his movements changes, though at first in ways only another martial artist could discern. Seeming clumsiness shifts suddenly into unearthly grace. He moves more slowly than his opponent expects, or flickers from stance to stance faster than the eye can follow. The student is not quite where his opponents expected him to be; his attacks break through the world itself, into the realm of dreams.
   Once he internalizes the first four Charms, the character's dreams lead him to a teacher in the waking world who can continue his training. Whether he does so is his own choice. Either way, the dreams stop and slowly fade from memory, as dreams do. A character who learns the Ephemeral Presence Technique can no longer doubt this is not just a somewhat odd Celestial martial art. Celestial practitioners, however, are not likely to realize that Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style is a Sidereal martial art until they find a sifu. A character needs a Sidereal sifu to learn the style's more advanced Charms - not to mention a considerably higher Essence and Martial Arts proficiency than when he began.
   Weapons and Armor: The Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style cannot be used with weapons, nor may the character wear armor while using its Charms. The Gossamer Understanding Charm removes these restrictions, but only insofar as the character may use armor and weapons crafted from dreams.

   The martial artist learns to take control of his inner self. He is now an entirely lucid dreamer and may remember his dreams perfectly (excepting those in which he learns this style). He also gains certain related benefits:
• The martial artist perceives the true nature of objects crafted from glamour or gossamer, the dream-stuffs of the Fair Folk. This does not intrinsically grant the power to see the reality behind glamours, but at least the character knows to try.
• The character can handle raw dream-stuff, such as dreams pulled out using Dream Ravager Hand, as if he held a physical object. Because other people can't normally hold dreams, however, he cannot hand one to someone else unless he places it in a dream catcher (see p. 141).
• The martial artist resists mental and physical warping from the Wyld. Treat all Wyld zones as one step closer to Creation. For example, the character resists the Deep Wyld as if it were only a Middlemarch.</description>

        <description>and none could awaken her.
   The character knows how a person's Essence changes between waking and sleeping. He can use that knowledge to strike a person's Essence and force it into the waking or sleeping pattern. The character attempts a normal Martial Arts attack while spending Essence. If the martial artist wants, the attack doesn't have to inflict real damage, but the attack roll must succeed. The attack's magical effect takes place if the martial artist's (Martial Arts + Essence) surpasses the target's Dodge MDV. It doesn't matter if any physical damage penetrates the target's soak. How long the target's changed state lasts (as well as its Essence cost) depends on the character's mastery of this Charm:
   Waking Level (2 motes): The target can be stunned through her next action. An unresisting subject can also be sent instantly to a normal sleep. This level also infallibly forces a sleeper to wake up, including someone put to sleep by this Charm, other Charms that induce sleep or spells.
   Dreaming Level (4 motes): The attack forces the target to sleep deeply for 24 hours. The target can resist the compulsion by spending one Willpower per action, but doing so only delays the target's slumber. The target can still be awakened by shocks such as slapping or dunking her in cold water. Alternatively, the target becomes unable to sleep naturally for as many days as the attacker's successes.
   Gossamer Level (6 motes): The target sleeps as long as the martial artist wants. Spending Willpower delays slumber but does not counter the effect. Someone who has a strong Intimacy to her can awaken the target. The martial artist can also set a condition for the target to wake up, such as physical harm or calling her name. The sleeper does not age or need to eat, excrete or breathe (though she does seem to breathe very slowly and shallowly). Alternatively, the target becomes unable to sleep again (until some set trigger removes the curse). Not only does this remove the target's ability to recover Willpower by sleeping, she will go mad after a number of days equal to her Willpower.</description>

        <description>For in her dreams, she had a lover who truly knew her,
   As a student of this martial art learns the secrets of dreams, she can induce dreams in other people. A strike to the target's Essence - even one light enough to inflict no damage - plants a dream within her consciousness.
   The character attempts a normal Martial Arts attack. If this attack succeeds, the character implants a dream, even if none of the attack's damage penetrates the target's soak. Indeed, the martial artist can attempt an attack that would not deal physical damage anyway. If the character's (Martial Arts + Essence) surpasses the target's Dodge MDV, the dream takes effect. At each level of power, the martial artist implants a more compelling vision.
   Waking Level (2 motes): The dream remains latent until the next time the target sleeps. It is just a dream, with no physical or metaphysical consequences. The target vividly remembers the dream on waking, though, so the martial artist can use the dream as a medium to attempt a social attack upon the target, using whatever Abilities she possesses.
   Dreaming Level (4 motes): The martial artist forces the character to dream while awake. The induced hallucination introduces one new entity into the target's perception. The new entity cannot include any sensation more overpowering than a brass band, but otherwise just about anything is possible. (One useful trick in combat is to create a hallucinatory double of yourself, so your opponent doesn't know which version to fight). The martial artist can use this hallucination to mask real entities too. He could make a peasant's hovel look, feel and smell like a strangely immobile yeddim. He could also force the target to see an uncovered pit as solid ground or make the target see and hear his best friend as a menacing deathknight (though the martial artist can't alter the friend's words). The dream image lasts the rest of the scene. The target can resist the waking dream for one action by spending a Willpower point. Implanting a new hallucination cancels out the old one.
   Gossamer Level (6 motes): The martial artist takes total control of the target's consciousness, for as long as she wants to keep it and can stay awake herself. She can add, subtract or change whatever perceptions she wants. She may hurl the target into a complete dream world with no connection to reality, or she may work subtly, deluding the character by changing just a few words heard by the character.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal establishment would love to know where the Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style came from. No Sidereal, it seems, remembers inventing it, in this life or another. The few Sidereal Exalted who learn it keep quiet, for their fellows regard the style with unease. Who keeps teaching this style? they ask each other. How is it that such a powerful and terrible thing is outside our control? Which would come as a surprise to the few Solar and Abyssal Exalted who don't realize they are learning Sidereal martial arts.
   The Sidereals know this much: Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style begins in dreams, and nowhere else. Sometimes, a student dreams of battles like exquisite dances. He fights beautiful opponents who slip away from him, laughing, then strike with the grace of a falling star. If the Exalt ignores these dreams, the dreams soon stop and never return. If the Exalt chooses to try to learn from these dream-battles, however, he can copy the techniques of his foes and find a sifu in his dreams to explain them. He wakes with his sifu forgotten - but after several nights of dreams, he knows these combat techniques and Charms in his waking life. The character must still pay each Charm's experience cost... but his training takes place when he sleeps.
   Unlike other Sidereal martial arts, characters with relatively low Martial Arts and Essence can learn the early Charms for Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style. At first, it seems like merely a rather odd Celestial martial art. As the character grows in power, so do the Charms, gradually revealing their Sidereal nature.
   As the Exalt continues his training, the quality of his movements changes, though at first in ways only another martial artist could discern. Seeming clumsiness shifts suddenly into unearthly grace. He moves more slowly than his opponent expects, or flickers from stance to stance faster than the eye can follow. The student is not quite where his opponents expected him to be; his attacks break through the world itself, into the realm of dreams.
   Once he internalizes the first four Charms, the character's dreams lead him to a teacher in the waking world who can continue his training. Whether he does so is his own choice. Either way, the dreams stop and slowly fade from memory, as dreams do. A character who learns the Ephemeral Presence Technique can no longer doubt this is not just a somewhat odd Celestial martial art. Celestial practitioners, however, are not likely to realize that Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style is a Sidereal martial art until they find a sifu. A character needs a Sidereal sifu to learn the style's more advanced Charms - not to mention a considerably higher Essence and Martial Arts proficiency than when he began.
   Weapons and Armor: The Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style cannot be used with weapons, nor may the character wear armor while using its Charms. The Gossamer Understanding Charm removes these restrictions, but only insofar as the character may use armor and weapons crafted from dreams.

        <description>though she did not see him.
   As the martial artist's two hands sweep past his target's head, he catches her dreams or memories of dreams and pulls them forth visibly. The character attempts a normal Martial Arts attack and can pull out dreams if his (Martial Arts + Essence) exceeds his target's Dodge MDV. The Martial Arts attack does not need to inflict damage (either because of the target's soak or the martial artist's restraint) for the dream theft to take place.
   Waking Level (2 motes): The martial artist pulls out one of the target's dreams. On a sleeping person, this can be the dream she experiences at that moment; on a waking person, it is the memory of the person's most recent dream. Dream Ravager Hand can also pull out daydreams. The martial artist can hold the dream or place it in a dream catcher, if he has one. Losing a single dream is harmless and can even be useful, if the target wants to examine her own dreams with her waking consciousness. Unless the Exalt has a dream catcher handy, the dream vanishes back to its owner as soon as he lets it go.
   Dreaming Level (4 motes): The martial artist doesn't just pull out a dream; he removes his target's capacity to dream, for as many days and nights as his player scored successes on the attack roll. The target can still sleep - but without dreams, she cannot recover Willpower by doing so. The martial artist needs a dream catcher to store the stolen capacity to dream, or the target's dreams fly back to her once the martial artist himself sleeps or is otherwise forced to stop holding the stolen dreams.
   Gossamer Level (6 motes): The martial artist strips away the target's capacity to dream for as long as he wants to keep it, with no need for a dream catcher. Without the ability to dream, the target eventually goes mad, as with Peaceful Repose Touch, unless she receives dreams from another source (for instance, dreams granted nightly using Fervent Night Phantasm, or perhaps bought from the Fair Folk). For what it's worth, the Fair Folk cannot ravage or beguile a person who cannot dream.</description>

        <description>She searched and searched but could not find him.
   No longer sure whether he is in the real world or wandering in dreams, the martial artist seems to have transcended mere physicality. In the clear light of everyday reality, it seems that he is not exactly where he appeared to be. As the world grows darker or more dubious, the character seems to be in more than one place at a time. Where people cannot see the world or there's no stable reality to see, it is obvious that he is everywhere.
   Even if he can be seen with perfect clarity, the character may raise his Dodge DV by two while this Charm is active. The martial artist also raises his effective Dexterity by one for calculating movement rates.
   In a Bordermarch or in conditions where his opponents suffer poor visibility, (see Exalted, p. 135) the bonus to the martial artist's Dodge DV equals his Essence rating. He adds his Essence to his Dexterity for calculating movement rates. The player may roll to reestablish surprise as if the character had cover. Anyone trying to find him on that action doubles any visibility penalty that applies to them at that time. The martial artist himself suffers no penalties to his perception because of the lighting or environment.
   If a character is in a place where his enemies suffer no visibility, or in a Middlemarch, all dice pools to detect the martial artist are reduced to zero before the use of Charms or stunts. Even if a searcher gets a dice pool, she must double any visibility penalties. Searchers end the search prepared to swear that the martial artist is simply not there. If a foe does miraculously find him, her attack pool likewise drops to zero before the use of Charms and stunts, while the martial artist still adds his Essence to his DV. On the other hand, the martial artist ignores all environmental penalties to any action he takes. His player also adds his Essence to any Perception pool as automatic successes.</description>

        <description>She questioned everyone in her dream.
   Brushing her hand past a dreaming person's head with a gesture like unlocking a door, the martial artist opens a momentary, silver-shimmering portal into the world of his dreams and steps through. For the next scene, she is physically present in his dream. While inside, the martial artist can unobtrusively observe the dream as it plays out... or use Fervent Night Phantasm to take control, to whatever extent she chooses. She can interact with the sleeper's dream self as if they were both corporeal or create whatever fantasy or nightmare she wants. The target can fight back against whatever the martial artist does, but only using Charms or stunts and with every dice pool reduced to zero before Charm or stunt modifiers.
   Nothing that happens in the dream is real, so the dream invader cannot cause any physical harm, but she can give the dreamer a very bad night - or a good one, or just a strange experience. At the Storyteller's option, an especially encouraging dream could grant the sleeping character a bonus on the Conviction roll to regain Willpower when he wakes, while an especially frightening or demoralizing dream could impose an internal penalty on the roll.
   If the martial artist possesses one of the target's dreams, taken through Dream Ravager Hand, or the target is currently experiencing a dream implanted using Fervent Night Phantasm, the martial artist can enter the target's dreams without being physically present. She simply makes the kata in the air and steps through. When the scene ends and the character must depart the dream, however, she stands beside the sleeper instead of wherever she was before.
   The dreamer will not naturally awaken while the martial artist influences his dreams, but some external event can wake him up. In that case, the martial artist suddenly appears beside her (probably quite surprised) target and spends one action stunned.

        <description>No one escaped her queries.
   When a martial artist activates this Charm, he must designate one person, within his sight at that time, as his target of pursuit. For the rest of the scene, the martial artist's movement rate is always one yard faster than his target's last action, as a subtle silver fire plays about him. It doesn't matter how the target moves: Move action, dashing, jumping, riding on a horse, transporting herself by spell... the martial artist always moves a little faster and can never be hid from or evaded.
   What's more, no material barrier can stop the pursuit if the martial artist can pass it in one of his own movements. If he can dash through the width of a wall, he passes through it as insubstantial as a dream. Even the ocean or the air does not impede his progress: He can walk on water just a little faster than his target's ship or stalk along the clouds behind his target's aerial steed. No matter where the martial artist goes, however, he has time to move to safe footing before the Charm ends. The Charm's effect also ends if he actually catches his target.
   Inescapable Nightmare Pursuit only works, however, if the martial artist's target is capable of dreaming. The effect will not work against, for example, an automaton or anyone who has had her dreams stolen with Dream Ravager Hand.</description>

        <description>As time passed, she forgot him and did not know why she wept in her sleep.
   The Exalt activates the Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Form through a weird, slow kata while the world around her seems to ripple like water. For the rest of the scene, the character receives the benefit of Ephemeral Presence Technique, and her surroundings are treated as poor visibility regardless of the illumination.
   In addition, the martial artist can reflexively negate any attempt to affect him in any way, at least on that action. Whatever an opponent or environmental effect might seek to do to him - hurt him, restrain him, trap him, persuade him - melts away, and he is as he would have been if it had never happened.
   The character can also make any action near-perfect: His player receives one success on any task the character attempts, no matter what internal or external penalties might naturally apply... including Defense Values. (Soak still applies, as it isn't a penalty). The martial artist cannot do flat-out impossible things or automatically perform actions that require more than one success, but if a task is possible in principle, he can probably do it. For example, he couldn't save himself from falling off a cliff by flapping his arms - that's impossible without magic. He could, however, scamper up a collapsing cliff despite the external penalty of 5, and a (Dexterity + Athletics) pool of 3. He is as invincible as a lord of dreams.
   A dramatic character, however, may effectively oppose the martial artist by exerting her own narrative potential on the dream the martial artist creates around himself. If an action or defense against the character is enhanced with Essence or a stunt, then the martial artist's player rolls (Essence) with an external penalty equal to the other person's Essence score. If the roll fails, the martial artist must resist the effect or play out the offensive action with only the basic effect of this Charm to aid him.
   The character can live beyond reality. When he is killed, he may shift into the dreams of anyone within (his Essence x 10) yards (or further than that if he carries one of the person's dreams). Although all of his possessions are left behind, his body disappears entirely and will reform - unharmed and alive - next to that person the next time the person dreams.
   Finally, once an Exalt learns Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Form, he becomes more resistant to the Wyld. All Wyld zones are treated as two steps closer to Creation, so Middlemarches cannot mutate or affect the character -unless he deliberately allows them to do so.</description>

            <description>The Sidereal establishment would love to know where the Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style came from. No Sidereal, it seems, remembers inventing it, in this life or another. The few Sidereal Exalted who learn it keep quiet, for their fellows regard the style with unease. Who keeps teaching this style? they ask each other. How is it that such a powerful and terrible thing is outside our control? Which would come as a surprise to the few Solar and Abyssal Exalted who don't realize they are learning Sidereal martial arts.
   The Sidereals know this much: Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style begins in dreams, and nowhere else. Sometimes, a student dreams of battles like exquisite dances. He fights beautiful opponents who slip away from him, laughing, then strike with the grace of a falling star. If the Exalt ignores these dreams, the dreams soon stop and never return. If the Exalt chooses to try to learn from these dream-battles, however, he can copy the techniques of his foes and find a sifu in his dreams to explain them. He wakes with his sifu forgotten - but after several nights of dreams, he knows these combat techniques and Charms in his waking life. The character must still pay each Charm's experience cost... but his training takes place when he sleeps.
   Unlike other Sidereal martial arts, characters with relatively low Martial Arts and Essence can learn the early Charms for Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style. At first, it seems like merely a rather odd Celestial martial art. As the character grows in power, so do the Charms, gradually revealing their Sidereal nature.
   As the Exalt continues his training, the quality of his movements changes, though at first in ways only another martial artist could discern. Seeming clumsiness shifts suddenly into unearthly grace. He moves more slowly than his opponent expects, or flickers from stance to stance faster than the eye can follow. The student is not quite where his opponents expected him to be; his attacks break through the world itself, into the realm of dreams.
   Once he internalizes the first four Charms, the character's dreams lead him to a teacher in the waking world who can continue his training. Whether he does so is his own choice. Either way, the dreams stop and slowly fade from memory, as dreams do. A character who learns the Ephemeral Presence Technique can no longer doubt this is not just a somewhat odd Celestial martial art. Celestial practitioners, however, are not likely to realize that Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style is a Sidereal martial art until they find a sifu. A character needs a Sidereal sifu to learn the style's more advanced Charms - not to mention a considerably higher Essence and Martial Arts proficiency than when he began.
   Weapons and Armor: The Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Style cannot be used with weapons, nor may the character wear armor while using its Charms. The Gossamer Understanding Charm removes these restrictions, but only insofar as the character may use armor and weapons crafted from dreams.

        <description>The Dreaming Elder's Sutra: The maiden awakened into daylight, silver tear tracks on her cheeks,
   Even the poorest, most sordid and colorless dream can be beautiful to the dreamer, and that beauty is more real than anything in Creation. The martial artist can make things from dreamstuff using Craft (Glamour), just like the Fair Folk do. Sadly, his work is more limited. The Fair Folk can create anything, even impossible or abstract things, but the martial artist is grounded in Creation, and what he makes must always be physical. He may forge swords, palaces, lovers - indeed, almost anything he could conceivably touch - but nothing else. Learning the Craft (Glamour) Ability is his own problem.
   The martial artist works with gossamer, which is to dreams as glass is to sand. Dream Ravager Hand enables the character to collect raw dreams. This Charm converts the dreams to gossamer, and then to whatever object the character wants to create, using Craft (Glamour) in place of any other Craft that would normally be required. (Glamour is always considered the character's favored material).
       Just as a jeweler could not make a gold bracelet from wood, however, the martial artist must use the proper kind of dreams. Common and generic things - a sword, a dress - can be made from the dreams of any common individual, but the raw materials for esoteric creations - an artifact, a person's perfect lover, a crown more beautiful than the dawn - require a long and difficult search. Brilliant artists and especially passionate individuals tend to have higher-quality dreams. The dreams of magically powerful individuals aren't always of higher quality, but they often are.
   Objects crafted by Gossamer Understanding follow the normal rules for creating that class of object. They are automatically excellent, but their excellence does not add to their Resources value for the purposes of creation rolls. Particularly large, complex, magical or beautiful things can have enormous difficulties - even up to 10 - and require decades or centuries to complete without help or the use of other Charms.
   The magical materials cannot be woven from gossamer; neither can artifacts rated higher than 3, an Exalted or enlightened Essence, or a living soul. The Exalted dream crafter can make sentient beings, even people that seem human in almost every way that matters, but they cannot have an Essence score greater than 1. The exotic materials for the creation of gossamer artifacts come in the form of rare and potent dreams. The character must seek out Fair Folk, demons or other powerful entities to secure the proper materials, and they certainly faces dubious bargains for the sake of his quest.
   Gossamer Understanding is not compatible with Sidereal Craft Charms - they craft fate, not dreams - but it can be used with those of other Exalted.
       Keep in mind that gossamer things are not well suited to existence in Creation. They age and decay far more swiftly than normal objects of their sort do. They seldom last as long as a decade even in the uncivilized edges of the world. On the Blessed Isle, they vanish in less than a year. In the Underworld, gossamer dissolves in mere days. The magic of the Exalted cannot further preserve such things, but Fair Folk magic might help.
   A martial artist may use any gossamer weapons or armor he creates with all Charms of this style. The weapon must, however, be a Martial Arts weapon, and the armor's mobility or fatigue values cannot exceed 2.</description>

        <description>and as she rose from her bed and blinked the last tears away,
   The martial artist strikes the air and Creation breaks, letting the Wyld pour in. The area around her becomes otherworldly and peculiar - it is shaped into a Middlemarch, and players of any characters within (50 yards for every 10 motes spent on this Charm) must roll to avoid both mutation and addiction in the initial surge of the Wyld. The martial artist himself is immune. A martial artist who knows this Charm treats all Wyld zones as three steps closer to Creation (so only the pure, formless Wyld beyond Creation can affect him... unless he allows the Wyld to change him, of course). This Middlemarch lasts the rest of the scene. Then it fades to a Bordermarch for a number of days equal to the Exalt's Essence, before finally stabilizing as Creation once more - but still faintly tainted by the Wyld.
   While in this zone, the character can use other Quicksilver Hand of Dreams Charms such as Ephemeral Presence Technique. She may also count her stunts as one level higher for every five motes she spends, to a maximum total stunt level of her Essence. Furthermore, if the Exalt has any gossamer equipment, it is empowered. For every five motes she spends, she gains +1 to the Accuracy, Damage, Defense and Rate of a weapon, or +1L/+1B for armor. Any living creatures made of glamour or gossamer fall under the martial artist's control - unless they are controlled by another, in which case the character's player attempts a resisted roll of his Essence versus the controller's Essence to seize command. Spending another five motes on this Charm allows the Exalt to roll another die and add it to her previous successes. A character cannot spend more motes on this Charm than (Martial Arts x 5).
   Finally, when the martial artist crafts gossamer in her Middlemarch, she can make anything with a difficulty of 5 or less in a number of actions equal to that difficulty.</description>

   The martial artist himself does not know whether his dreams are real, but it doesn't matter. For the rest of the scene, he is a lucid dreamer, and everything within (Essence x 10) yards is his dream. Therefore, he chooses what happens. The Exalt cannot force a genuinely impossible event in the context of the scene, nor an event without any apparent cause. For example, his enemies will not simply fall over dead for no reason. He must kill them or decide that they start arguing and kill each other or arrange for them to die in some other understandable way.
   The Storyteller assigns a stunt value for the story the martial artist invents for the rest of the scene. The stunt value may be enhanced using Chimerical Ascension (almost anything's possible in the Wyld). All through the scene, anyone with an Essence pool who wishes to avoid being drawn into the character's dream narrative may spend a Willpower point to act against the Exalt's version of events. Any actions an unwilling character takes that contradict her vision have their dice pool reduced to zero before the use of Charms. Once the rebel character spends Willpower points equal to the story's stunt value, the fantasy melts away, leaving the martial artist standing bereft in the shreds of her dream.
   Fantasy may be used only once per scene.</description>

   A soldier protects what is his to protect. By taking this stance on the battlefield, the character makes sure that the ground on which he stands remains inviolate. Should any foe approach, that foe is forced back in an instant. For the Charm's duration, the character may attack anyone who approaches within (Essence x 2) yards. These attacks take the form of pushing gestures. The martial artist never touches his enemies, but they feel the force of his Essence. For every yard by which a target has pierced this boundary, the character adds one die to his reflexive attack. Any target he successfully hits also suffers knockback, moving a number of yards per die of raw damage equal to his Strength. The character may not take Move or Dash actions while this Charm is active. He may end the Charm early, if he wishes.</description>

   No amount of interference can keep a dedicated dragonlord from her goal. With an enemy ahead, she marches her troops left or right. When surrounded, she forms up to pierce her enemies' ranks. While this Charm is active, the character demonstrates that flexibility and ingenuity to move as she likes.
   As soon as the martial artist takes her first step in a Move or Dash action, she dematerializes. She retakes her material and visible form the moment she stops. This technique allows her to walk though obstacles as long as she does not stop inside them, including people, walls and war machines. Immaterial obstacles impede her. She is not automatically safe from attack, though. Since she becomes material and visible once she stops moving, most opponents can still move and target her with their attacks on the tick when she stops moving (as long as they can guess which way the character is going).
   The martial artist can avoid reflexive attacks or damaging area effects, like that of Unassailable Rebuff Position. If she is never material while inside the affected area or the range for attacks, she is not a valid target for such efforts unless they can affect immaterial beings. Taking a Dash action, the character does not become material again until the Dash ends. Note that, without special Charms, material creatures and objects become invalid targets for an immaterial character.
   While the character is immaterial, other immaterial objects and entities become valid targets for her attacks. Conversely, immaterial entities can attack the character. When two martial artists use this Charm at once, they may trade blows while both are immaterial or material, as desired.</description>

   The character moves with the greatest speed, mimicking the nature for a general's influence to be everywhere. Aiding beleaguered soldiers one minute, leading troops to victory in the next, his feet cross dozens of yards at a step, as many or as little as he likes. As long as the character moves in a straight line (following the contours of the terrain), he can move as far as he can see. He does not naturally avoid obstacles or people. Spending an additional mote allows him to walk on air for a single tick, moving even to locations that are not accessible from the ground, though he must still have a straight-line path to that place.</description>

        <description>Looking only at her mirror,
   With perfect information, one could choose an optimal strategy. With no information, or random information, strategy becomes impossible. A martial artist who uses this Charm does not always attack a foe's weakness or withdraw from loss. Instead, she follows a strategy of calculated randomness. Children, usually unwittingly, follow this tactic simply through their unique, uneducated-but-brilliant worldview. The Maidens protect children and fools, they say.
   The character moves without any obvious tactical plan. She ducks low when others expect her to block high, and she weaves left as her opponents try to drive her backward. Her apparently random blocks and stances set her opponents completely off guard.
   Each time the martial artist becomes aware of an attack upon her, her player rolls one die. Rolling no success indicates that her strategy gave her no special advantage in that situation. With one success, her opponent could not keep track of her, and her defense was well-suited to his confused attack - divide his attack successes in half before Step 5. Two successes indicate that the character's strategy perfectly countered his, nullifying his attack.
   At the same time, the character's selection of actions completely optimizes her opportunities to strike. Because a foe never knows how the martial artist will attack next, he cannot choose his martial strategy to counter hers and is often blindsided by her blows. While this Charm is active, all the character's attacks are considered unexpected.
   When opposed by another character using this Charm, both characters' attacks and defenses are resolved as if there were no special considerations.</description>

   Sometimes, it is possible to protect a thing so well that it is never in any danger. This Charm provides that defense for one target of the character's choice. Any individual entity is a valid target for this Charm. When the martial artist prepares the Charm, he cuts his palm and declares whom he protects. The blood forms an oath and seeps into his palm like a scarlet tattoo. From that moment until he voluntarily ends the Charm, the martial artist can redirect every physical and magical assault on the target to himself instead. Be it an arrow in the night, an imperious and unnatural mental command or the mind-rending assault of a Fair One, the character's magic imposes himself and his Essence between the offender and his ward.
   When danger looms, the character instantly becomes aware and has a choice. He may disappear from his current location in a burst of faint, starry light and instantly appear before his charge, taking whatever attack was meant for her. The character becomes the target of the attack and may defend as normal. Alternatively, he may send an effigy of Essence, which appears as a silhouette image of himself between the aggressor (or the threat) and the target. The assault still targets his ward, but the Sidereal may activate any Charm or Combo to protect her as if the attack did target him. By spending three motes reflexively, the character may charge his Essence with more of himself before sending it to his friend's defense. The attack must hit him as if he had gone himself, but he doesn't need to find his way back to where he was before.
   A character may commit himself to defend multiple individuals, but doing so tends to be draining. Students of this style hear legends that some masters find a way to apply this Charm to the defense of a place, nation or ideal, but they do not know how true that could be.</description>

        <description>and lost her head.
   Everything orders itself according to its nature. The family composes itself around the eldest relatives and the ancestors' shrines, while monasteries channel focus into meditation and reverence. The battlefield has two orders: one that represents maximum organization and one that contains maximum entropy - before and after the enemy is met.
   The character embodies this duality and carries its touch in hers. After activating this Charm, she appears differently to different people. An observer with a greater Conviction or Temperance sees her stand tall as a perfect specimen of warrior discipline, walking and moving in flawless precision. A person who has greater Compassion or Valor watches as she slouches further than the human body should bend, to the point where several joints or vertebrae must be broken, and her actions look dangerously unfocused. Those rare people who balance two opposing Virtues see her as an impossible amalgam of mindlessly constructed body and ideal human, two contradictory states embodied in the same flesh. Each person who meets her eyes sees in one his ideal self, in the other himself destroyed. To those who see her ordered self, her attacks cannot be dodged, and she adds to her Parry DV a bonus equal to her Essence. Attacks against one who sees her entropic nature cannot be parried, and against his blows, she adds a bonus equal to her Essence to her Dodge DV. A person who sees both aspects can neither parry nor dodge her attacks. Appropriate perfect defenses can defeat these assaults, as usual.
   Only with Essence perception can one see the faint auras of power glistening around the martial artist's hands. One shines with the blackness of perfect order, and the other with the pure ivory of disorder. Either one can kill. Either one can heal. When the Exalt touches someone, her hand either conflicts with or reinforces that person's internal nature. To inflict the Essence of order upon someone whose highest Virtue is either Compassion or Valor causes him levels of aggravated damage equal to that Virtue. Touching entropy to someone whose highest Virtue is either Conviction or Temperance does likewise. Infusing a person instead with the Essence that is most like his highest-rated Virtue heals that many health levels, including aggravated damage. A character who has equally high Virtues that conflict suffers neither effect. These effects cannot be transferred through weapons.
   Successfully touching a target with either hand accomplishes more than simply damaging or repairing him. Infusing a target with entropy prevents the target from channeling or otherwise benefiting from Conviction and Temperance for the rest of the scene. Likewise, the touch of order blocks the use of Compassion and Valor. The only exception is a character's primary Virtue, which cannot be subdued. When the character's attack would affect an Exalt's primary Virtue, the attempt adds one to that Exalt's Limit. A target gains Limit from this source only once per scene.</description>

        <description>Elder Sutra of Sacrifice: When the rookery falls
   The placement of each legion, each wing and fang of troops can decide a battle. Placement determines which portions of the field each side controls and where a general can leverage additional force and how quickly. Intelligent arrangement is as important in small-scale combat, where putting two friends back-to-back can save the lives of both or surrounding an enemy force can be the key to killing it. This sort of placement must be done before a battle, because it is simply too difficult to change it effectively during the conflict.
       Victory of the Cheat evades this principle. In the instant that the character activates the Charm, she may rearrange the people on the battlefield as she sees fit. No ostentatious effects herald the movement, but it is still obvious to all involved or watching - every person the character can see suddenly moves (or doesn't, as the Exalt desires) to any new location also within her line of sight.
   Using this Charm in the midst of mass combat allows the character to reshape units to her whim. She can break large units up into units of smaller Magnitude or condense many units from the same army into units of greater Magnitude. Likewise, she can decide what formation they are in, from rabble to phalanx. Unless they know what's coming, neither choice is particularly useful for the troops thus reordered - a suddenly larger unit may not have enough relays to keep order, and other special characters might compete for command of the unit. A unit without the training (Drill rating) to maintain a more complex formation quickly falls into one less ordered. And trying to integrate soldiers from two separate armies into one massive unit simply results in two completely unordered units of enormous Magnitude that have the lowest Drill rating of any of their soldiers and are considered engaged. Unless the character takes special care that soldiers remain near their known companions and under familiar commanders, most units' commanders will need to perform Rally actions in order to keep their troops together.
   In combats on a smaller scale, the character can retrieve her friends from positions of disadvantage, flee at great speed, surround a foe or otherwise use this Charm to her advantage. Exalted and other Essence-wielders may resist this effect. If the Sidereal tries to move any person with an Essence greater than 1, the martial artist's player and target's player make a resisted roll of each character's permanent Essence. If the target's player rolls at least as many successes as the martial artist's player, the Charm does not affect that target.</description>

        <description>and the birds all fly away,
   In some situations, danger and death threatens from all sides, and there is only one way to evade them. Princes escape murder by signing away their inheritances, and daughters escape unwanted betrothals by fleeing with their lovers. Sometimes, it's not actually the only way out, but it looks like it at the time. When the character activates this Charm, he launches an assault at his target. His attack seems so perfectly planned that his foe sees only one possible way to avoid its deadly consequences.
   Activating this Charm, the character's player names an action that his target must take in order to escape his flawless maneuver. The victim instinctively knows what that action is. She knows that performing it on her next action may be the only way to avoid near-certain death. Any single action is valid - attack a certain target, flee, use a certain Combo, whatever - as long as the target can perform it on her next action. If the named action is an unacceptable order for the target (see Exalted, p. 180), like something suicidal, the target may spend a point of Willpower in order not to perform the action and not suffer the Charm's other effects. Naming an action that the target cannot perform is an impossible action, and the Charm then has no effect. Choosing to escape the maneuver means the target uses her next action as the martial artist's player dictated upon activating the Charm. The target of this Charm does not necessarily perform the action cleanly and willingly. Instead, by accepting the attack's escape, the target acts in some way that makes her next action equivalent to the declared action.
   Even knowing that not performing the action could mean death, the target may choose not to take the "escape". Refusing the escape forces her to suffer the final effect of this Charm. A target who does not perform the required action leaves herself completely vulnerable to the character's planned attack, which he takes on the action following his target's choice and may not be part of a flurry. The martial artist may choose to perform another action, aborting the Charm. The target cannot use any defense against the attack. The Sidereal can use any Martial Arts-based attack available to him, but it becomes a perfect attack that bypasses even perfect defenses (normally impossible - but the target was already offered a perfect defense and turned it down).
   Example: The Sidereal Paan Uttara's exploration of the deathly city of Stygia has gone very wrong. His Abyssal foe, Augur of Sorrow's End, now fights him above the Mouth of Oblivion. Paan recognizes that Augur's mighty soulsteel shield protects him too well and that unless the Sidereal can eliminate that advantage, Augur will kill him. Using Singular Escape Stratagem, Paan maneuvers himself and Augur into the necessary position, and Paan's player declares that Augur must throw the shield into the Mouth of Oblivion. The key moment in that maneuvering comes on Augur's next action, when he chooses to throw the shield away. Had Augur decided to keep his shield, Paan's next action would have been quite painful for his target.
   Descriptively, Augur of Sorrow's End becomes aware of the threat. Seeing the only way to escape Paan Uttara's closing trap, Augur unstraps his great shield and swings it at Paan like a huge door. At that moment, Paan needs only a small tap to send the shield spinning into the Void. It sounds much cooler than saying, "I throw the shield away", even though that is the equivalent action.</description>

        <description>you cannot shoot them all down
   A true master of strategy never places herself into a position where she can easily be struck. Only the most brilliant and ruthless tactics can hope to overwhelm her perfect defenses. Otherwise, she is invulnerable to lesser beings' assaults - she redirects or steps around a blow as easily as she masters the lesser techniques they practice.
   With this Charm active, the martial artist gains a perfect defense against every attack that does not fit certain conditions. The character must be rendered unable to maneuver by surrounding foes, in which case the one attacker who benefits from an unexpected attack (see Exalted, p. 155) considers the martial artist a valid target. This attack is resolved normally for an unexpected attack. Charms or other effects that allow the character to be aware of or defend against unexpected attacks do not eliminate the attack's validity. Or, the Sidereal must be targeted by a coordinated attack that successfully coordinates a number of participants greater than or equal to her Essence. In that case, all attacks on her person are resolved normally. Opponents whose Essence is greater than or equal to the character's consider her a valid target as normal.
   The great thinker is prepared for even the most disastrous situations and has a response. In either case, she receives automatic counterattacks at her full dice pool against all valid targets that attack her while benefiting from the above conditions.</description>

            <description>Those who would study war and conflict must study patterns of movement. Soldiers are straightforward, moving always toward their destination, but they do not want to die. That fear can disrupt their pattern and end their chance of victory. Dragonlords march their troops obliquely, to surround and control a battlefield. Their weakness is fear for their command. Generals move everyone according to their strategy, retreating and advancing to fool opponents and close traps. Spending units like valuable jade, they buy their victories with care. And children move at their whim and throw away armies like toys, making them the most dangerous of all.
   Scarlet Patterned Battlefield Style is one of the standard advanced secret styles, taught to ambitious and promising Sidereal Exalted. Although it is not of supreme power, it can be quite effective in the right hands. The Chosen of the Maiden of Battles particularly like it, for obvious reasons.
   Weapons and Armor: This style may not be practiced in armor. It has no form weapons.
   Complementary Abilities: An Exalt who wants to learn Scarlet Patterned Battlefield Style must first possess three dots in War.

        <description>unless you shoot only one.
       Kill one, and you defeat all. Secure surrender from the leader and the rest lose their fight. Humiliate a ringleader in order to declaw all of her cronies. It's the nature of people to relate their welfare to that of another, to rise or fall with her good or ill fortune. This Charm just makes that decision for them.
   Attacking someone with this Charm requires a simple (Dexterity + Martial Arts) attack, which merely has to hit - it inflicts no damage in any case. A successful strike instantly binds all of the target's friends, allies, minions and the like within eyeshot or (Essence x 5) miles, whichever is further, to her state of being. Until the martial artist releases that bond, any attack on his target is also an attack on everyone now bound to her. Effectively, they all suffer any effect that the target suffers in Step 10 of attack resolution, including rolled damage, knockdown, stunning and the myriad enhancements that Charms can apply. Additionally, the target's general condition projects upon them any of the following conditions from which the target suffers: the inability to defend oneself due to grappling, poisons, sicknesses and further effects available through Charms. If an effect permits an opportunity to resist it in Step 10, however, as is the case for knockdown and several Charms, each recipient resists individually.
   This Charm cannot directly kill anyone bound to the leader's fate. When damage transmitted by The Empress Lives for All would kill a person, that person is knocked unconscious instead. A person could still die through subsequent blood loss. Effects caused by Charms, such as magical poisons or sicknesses, can kill through their ongoing effect after transmission by the Empress Lives for All.</description>

            <description>This ancient Sidereal martial art is popularly known among the Viziers as "the twice-mastered art". The less crude interpretation of this moniker refers to the style's history. Legend has it that Sapphire Veil Of Passion Style was originally invented by Entwined in Night's Shadows, a Chosen of Secrets. But he was selfish and proud, and refused to teach the style he had invented. He never took a student or produced any records, and its mysteries died with him. Centuries later, it was recreated from secondhand accounts and first-hand insights by an ambitious Joybringer to settle a bet with Ma-Ha-Suchi, and has remained a favored possession of the Chosen of Serenity ever since.
   Sapphire Veil of Passion was derived from extensive first-hand study of that most ancient and enduring fascination of the human race - sex. Its masters weather the ribald jokes and off-color commentary of their younger contemporaries with patience and good humor. Those who face them in battle discover that these martial artists have turned their focus inward upon the hottest of flames and have tempered it into an exceedingly fine weapon. They do not jest about the style afterward. For more information on Sidereal martial arts, see Scroll of the Monk.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks made with the urumi and its artifact equivalent, the floating ribbon, as unarmed attacks. This style is not compatible with armor, but is traditionally used with a buckler.

   Clearing her mind of all but the sensation of the moment, the martial artist cuts her gaze across an opponent. In so doing she sees him anew, with unsurpassed clarity. The character immediately gains the following knowledge about one individual: what manner of being the target is (Solar Exalt, god, raksha, etc), which martial arts styles he knows at least one Charm from, which martial arts styles he knows up to the Form-Type Charm, which martial arts styles he has mastered, whether he has any Intimacies toward the martial artist, and the nature of those Intimacies, if they exist.
   For the rest of the scene, the martial artist gains a +2 bonus to her DVs and MDVs against any opponent she has evaluated in this manner. Into Infinite Depths may be activated as an innate power, which does not count as a Charm activation if Sapphire Veil of Passion Form is active.</description>

        <description>She flirted her way across Creation,
   Taking attention to imply invitation, the character is able to quickly close with those who draw her notice. This Charm may be activated in response to any social or physical attack. The martial artist vanishes in a swirl of collapsing sapphire ribbons, appearing one yard away from her attacker. In the case of long-range social attacks (such as those delivered through sorcery), the Charm's maximum allowable range of movement is (Essence x 20) miles. This action incidentally acts as a perfect dodge upon activation against physical ranged attacks of which the martial artist is aware, assuming the attack can be dodged. Subsequent ranged attacks during the remainder of the Charm's duration must be defended against normally.
   As long as the martial artist does not voluntarily move away from the individual whom she activated Eternal Infatuation Dance to approach, she may stay within one yard of him at all times, regardless of his movement rate or any exotic movement abilities employed.
   The initial movement granted by this Charm is considered a counterattack. This Charm may not be invoked more than once per action.</description>

   Wild ribbons of yellow and scarlet power blaze around the character's attacking limb. Channeling her understanding of the male principle of Essence, the martial artist enchants an unarmed attack with aggressive, penetrating power. The attack is considered unblockable, ignores soak derived from armor, and in addition to inflicting standard damage, ignites a number of the target's motes equal to the martial artist's (Essence x 2). These motes are not only lost, but also immediately applied as raw lethal damage which ignores armor, but is soaked separately from the original attack. If the target lacks sufficient Essence, or lacks Essence at all, this aspect of the attack is wasted.</description>

   Stepping back from determined opposition, the martial artist swirls with onyx ribbons. Channeling her understanding of the female principle of Essence, she enhances an unarmed parry against any attack she can perceive, even unblockable attacks, rendering the defense it provides perfect. Additionally, the martial artist regains one channel of any Virtue of her choice for every five motes or fraction thereof the opponent spent on the blocked attack. For example, if an opponent spends one to five motes, the martial artist regains one channel. If an opponent spends six to 10 motes, the martial artist regains two channels (one for the first set of five motes, and another for the remainder in the second set of five motes).</description>

Additionally, when any of her attacks inflict damage, the target must pay one Willpower or accept an Intimacy toward the Sidereal. (This Intimacy represents lust if appropriate to the character's gender preferences, uneasy fascination otherwise).</description>

Centuries later, it was recreated from secondhand accounts and first-hand insights by an ambitious Joybringer to settle a bet with Ma-Ha-Suchi, and has remained a favored possession of the Chosen of Serenity ever since.
   Sapphire Veil of Passion was derived from extensive first-hand study of that most ancient and enduring fascination of the human race - sex. Its masters weather the ribald jokes and off-color commentary of their younger contemporaries with patience and good humor. Those who face them in battle discover that these martial artists have turned their focus inward upon the hottest of flames and have tempered it into an exceedingly fine weapon. They do not jest about the style afterward. For more information on Sidereal martial arts, see Scroll of the Monk.
   Weapons and Armor: Charms of this style treat attacks made with the urumi and its artifact equivalent, the floating ribbon, as unarmed attacks. This style is not compatible with armor, but is traditionally used with a buckler.

   The martial artist executes a languid kata, hesitates a moment, and then erupts into a shuddering battle pattern. Her anima unfolds into a towering, shifting array of cerulean and sapphire ribbons, which twine about her body even as they strain for the sky. She levitates a finger's length above the ground as she moves, incidentally gaining perfect balance and the ability to move safely over hazardous terrain. Players of all characters who possess any sort of Intimacy toward her, positive or negative, must fail a Compassion roll or pay one Willpower per attack made against her. If she manages to strike any character who possesses no Essence or Willpower (non-Essence users are not evaluated for current Essence, only Willpower) with an unarmed attack, that character is immediately rendered unconscious for (attacker's Martial Arts) hours as a Crippling effect. Finally, she gains five motes whenever her DV refreshes.</description>

   Advanced students of the Sapphire Veil of Passion are among Creation's more careless fighters (and lovers), unconcerned with the consequences of their actions. This Charm may be activated when the martial artist successfully strikes an opponent with an unarmed attack, levying one of the following effects:
• The martial artist immediately terminates the effects of all unnatural mental influence from which she suffers, transferring them to her target, who must then deal with them as he is best able.
• The martial artist immediately terminates the effects of all Poison and Sickness effects from which she suffers, transferring them to her target.</description>

       Moving through a swift kata, the martial artist weaves sapphire threads out of her own Essence, which quickly knot around her. She is unable to take Dash or Jump actions while this Charm is in effect. More beneficially, she adds her Martial Arts rating in successes to all rolls to establish or control a grapple. Any character who enters a grapple with her (even one who initiated the grapple by attacking the martial artist) automatically gains an Intimacy of lust toward her, regardless of standard sexual preferences. This unnatural Emotion effect costs three Willpower to resist, or two if the character is not of the sex to which the target is normally attracted. Finally, all rolls by opponents to establish control of a grapple suffer an external penalty equal to the martial artist's Appearance if her last action was to hold an opponent.</description>

   The martial artist gently touches a target she has rendered unconscious during the scene, manipulating the flow of his Essence through the chakra points known as the gates of desire. Upon awakening, the target gains a second Motivation to "Love and obey (the martial artist)". Her memories are also altered so that she believes the martial artist is an old friend or lover (whichever is appropriate to her normal sexual preferences). Memories that might contradict this belief are suppressed.
       Resisting this unnatural mental influence requires that the target spend three Willpower within the space of a scene, over a number of scenes equal to (10 - target's Essence). While Joy in Ownership remains in effect, the target is metaphysically con-sidered to be the martial artist's property.</description>

• All of the target's actions are reduced to 0 dice if not supplemented by a Charm or stunt.
• A mote surcharge equal to half the martial artist's Appearance is added to all of the target's Charms. This effect may be applied only to targets of lower Essence.
• The target's Dexterity is considered to be 0 for the purpose of calculating Move and Dash actions, and his Strength to be 0 for the purpose of calculating Jump actions.
   These effects last until the end of the scene, and this Charm may be re-applied to the same target over the course of repeated hold actions in order to inflict additional effects.</description>

   Try as they might, the martial artist's former conquests cannot shake that status. This Charm supplements an unarmed attack, rendering it unblockable and undodgeable if any of the following criteria apply to the target:
• The martial artist has defeated the target in combat at some point in the past (defined as having rendered the target unconscious, or the target having voluntarily admitted defeat or surrendered to the martial artist on the field of battle, even if only in a sparring match).
• The target carries an Intimacy of any sort for the martial artist.
• The martial artist owns the target.
• The target suffers from any Crippling effect inflicted by the martial artist.
   If two or more of these criteria apply to the target, the attack is also considered unexpected.</description>

   Coming to understand the pinnacle of desire, the martial artist steeps himself in the incon-sequential motives that shift the world. This Charm allows the martial artist to pay a (+10m, 1wp) surcharge when activating Sapphire Veil of Passion Form, upgrading it with the following capabilities:
• The martial artist gains the ability to solidify and control the sapphire ribbons of her anima, treating them as starmetal floating ribbons. Each time her DV refreshes, she gains a pool (equal to half her Essence) of reflexive martial arts attacks with these ribbons, which she may unleash at any time using her full dice pool. This pool refreshes along with her DV, and may not exceed (Essence/2) actions.
• The range on all urumi or floating ribbons the martial artist employs extends to (Essence x 10) yards. No motes need be paid for this benefit.
• Any character wounded by an urumi or floating ribbon wielded by the martial artist feels the pain transformed and transported into a kind of transcendent ecstasy. The distraction from this overwhelming sensation changes all wound penalties from internal to external until the end of the scene, as a Crippling effect.</description>
